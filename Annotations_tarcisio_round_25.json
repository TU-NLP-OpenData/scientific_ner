Therefore we study learning curricula for node representation learning in heterogeneous star networks, i.e., learning an optimal sequence of edges of different types for the node representation learning process.

Existing approaches try to utilize the knowledge transferred from other mature sites, which often require overlapped users or similar items to ensure an effective knowledge transfer. However, these assumptions may not hold in practice because 1) Overlapped user set is often unavailable and costly to identify due to the heterogeneous user profile, content and network data, and 2) Different schemes to show item attributes across sites cause the attribute values inconsistent, incomplete, and noisy.

Two concepts from Science and Technology Studies are introduced - thought styles and design logics. The paper demonstrates how diverse thinking about how to approach knowledge representation on the Web is rooted in debates that emerged in artificial intelligence in the 1970s and 1980s. It then goes on to discuss how the diverse approaches to Web semantics that emerged from these legacies have cultural and political implications. The paper concludes with a call for further research that positions Web architectures as objects of social and cultural study.", "annotations": [{"label": 18, "start_offset": 93, "end_offset": 117, "user": 2}, {"label": 16, "start_offset": 266, "end_offset": 319, "user": 2}, {"label": 18, "start_offset": 404, "end_offset": 434, "user": 3}, {"label": 16, "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19, "user": 3}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 1570, "text": "Social media has quickly established itself as an important means that people, NGOs and governments use to spread information during natural or man-made disasters, mass emergencies and crisis situations. Given this important role, real-time analysis of social media contents to locate, organize and use valuable information for disaster management is crucial. In this paper, we propose self-learning algorithms that, with minimal supervision, construct a simple bag-of-words model of information expressed in the news about various natural disasters. Such a model is human-understandable, human-modifiable and usable in a realtime scenario. Since tweets are a diffferent category of documents than news, we next propose a model transfer algorithm, which essentially refines the model learned from news by analyzing a large unlabeled corpus of tweets. We show empirically that model transfer improves the predictive accuracy of the model. We demonstrate empirically that our model learning algorithm is better than several state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms.", "annotations": [{"label": 18, "start_offset": 231, "end_offset": 274, "user": 2}, {"label": 16, "start_offset": 386, "end_offset": 410, "user": 2}, {"label": 16, "start_offset": 462, "end_offset": 480, "user": 2}, {"label": 14, "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 83, "user": 3}, {"label": 18, "start_offset": 328, "end_offset": 347, "user": 3}, {"label": 16, "start_offset": 231, "end_offset": 265, "user": 3}, {"label": 16, "start_offset": 722, "end_offset": 736, "user": 3}, {"label": 17, "start_offset": 915, "end_offset": 923, "user": 3}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 1571, "text": "Solving technical problems with complex systems and integrating the many technologies employed in these multifaceted structures has been a recurring theme in Smart Cities research. This paper presents an analysis of the reason this problem has been so well explored but persists with no solution widely available. The problem is viewed as a combination of Smart City needs, governance, and increasingly technically difficult decisions. The paper describes the requirements that must be met to develop a framework that can address this seeming intractable and expanding integration concern, identifies the governance processes that can be used to address this problem, and to manage integration in Smart Cities, The solution proposed is a formalized accepted and managed technology regulated environment introduced by governance groups composed of city planners/managers, citizen, stake holders, and technology delivery organizations. The solution requirements dictate the establishment of a standard that would guide the development and usage of automated, autonomous components, integrating dynamically with software agents. All of this working to rapidly optimize shared resources through error handling processes executing largely at no cost except those of processing time, meeting safety guidelines, satisfying operational monitoring needs, and meeting post issue liability guidelines. This technical standard would obligate developers and vendors to meet safety standards and accept liability for malfeasance. As initiating steps, Smart City managers must come together and establish a basic understanding of the goals and regulations, and the methodologies for implementing them.", "annotations": [{"label": 18, "start_offset": 682, "end_offset": 709, "user": 2}, {"label": 14, "start_offset": 1537, "end_offset": 1547, "user": 3}, {"label": 16, "start_offset": 204, "end_offset": 212, "user": 3}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 1572, "text": "Verifiability is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia, where editors are encouraged to provide citations for the added statements. Statements can be any arbitrary piece of text, ranging from a sentence up to a paragraph. However, in many cases, citations are either outdated, missing, or link to non-existing references (e.g. dead URL, moved content etc.). In total, 20% of the cases such citations refer to news articles and represent the second most cited source. Even in cases where citations are provided, there are no explicit indicators for the span of a citation for a given piece of text. In addition to issues related with the verifiability principle, many Wikipedia entity pages are incomplete, with relevant information that is already available in online news sources missing. Even for the already existing citations, there is often a delay between the news publication time and the reference time. In this thesis, we address the aforementioned issues and propose automated approaches that enforce the verifiability principle in Wikipedia, and suggest relevant and missing news references for further enriching Wikipedia entity pages.

We conducted a detailed study of Content Censorship (CC) and Content Edit (CE) in Facebook using a detailed longitudinal dataset consisting of 57 public Facebook pages over 3 weeks covering 145,955 posts and 9,379,200 comments. We detected many CC and CE activities between 28% and 56% of these pages (in both Facebook Posts and Comments).

{"id": 1574, "text": "We consider the problem of discovering local events on the web, where events are entities extracted from webpages. Examples of such local events include small venue concerts, farmers markets, sports activities, etc. Given an event entity, we propose a graph-based framework for retrieving a ranked list of related events that a user is likely to be interested in attending. Due to the difficulty of obtaining ground-truth labels for event entities, which are temporal and are constrained by location, our retrieval framework is unsupervised, and its graph-based formulation addresses (a) the challenge of feature sparseness and noisiness, and (b) the semantic mismatch problem in a self-contained and principled manner.\n To validate our methods, we collect human annotations and conduct a comprehensive empirical study, analyzing the performance of our methods with regard to relevance, recall, and diversity.

{"id": 1575, "text": "While search technology is widely used for learning-oriented information needs, the results provided by popular services such as Web search engines are optimized primarily for generic relevance, not effective learning outcomes. As a result, the typical information trail that a user must follow while searching to achieve a learning goal may be an inefficient one involving unnecessarily easy or difficult content, or material that is irrelevant to actual learning progress relative to a user's existing knowledge. We address this problem by introducing a novel theoretical framework, algorithms, and empirical analysis of an information retrieval model that is optimized for learning outcomes instead of generic relevance. We do this by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates a cognitive learning model into a retrieval objective, and then give an algorithm for an efficient approximate solution to find the search results that represent the best 'training set' for a human learner. Our model can personalize results for an individual user's learning goals, as well as account for the effort required to achieve those goals for a given set of retrieval results.
