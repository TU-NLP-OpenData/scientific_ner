We applied the self-expressiveness, which is a property of a dataset when the data points lie in a union of low dimensional subspaces, to the low-rank matrix completion. By considering self-expressiveness of low dimensional subspaces, the proposed low-rank matrix completion may perform well even with little information, leading to the robust completion on a dataset with high missing rate. In our experiments on movie rating datasets, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art matrix completion models.

This paper focuses on learning node representations for heterogeneous star networks, which have a center node type linked with multiple attribute node types through different types of edges. In heterogeneous star networks, we observe that the training order of different types of edges affects the learning performance significantly. Therefore we study learning curricula for node representation learning in heterogeneous star networks, i.e., learning an optimal sequence of edges of different types for the node representation learning process. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, with the action as selecting a specific type of edges for learning or terminating the training process, and the state as the sequence of edge types selected so far. The reward is calculated as the performance on external tasks with node representations as features, and the goal is to take a series of actions to maximize the cumulative rewards. We propose an approach based on deep reinforcement learning for this problem. Our approach leverages LSTM models to encode states and further estimate the expected cumulative reward of each state-action pair, which essentially measures the long-term performance of different actions at each state. Experimental results on real-world heterogeneous star networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach over competitive baseline approaches.","inCitations":["4e5592a19eab030938b228e934b3dc162f5cc6d9","d8c7d8d22f25dca0e0af8e17a37b0c9822a13baf"],"pmid":"","title":"Curriculum Learning for Heterogeneous Star Network Embedding via Deep Reinforcement Learning","journalPages":"468-476","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159711"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Divergence (computer science)","ENCODE","Feature learning","Long short-term memory","Machine learning","Markov chain","Markov decision process","Reinforcement learning","Star network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"dffe1a5fa1b9d32d0fdb0c220e7cbafa023829e5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dffe1a5fa1b9d32d0fdb0c220e7cbafa023829e5","authors":[{"name":"Meng Qu","ids":["35955224"]},{"name":"Jian Tang","ids":["26791708"]},{"name":"Jiawei Han","ids":["1722175"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159711"}

While much work has been done on understanding the users in Web search, little knowledge is available about the search tasks and behavior of users in the E-Commerce (E-Com) search applications. In this paper, we share the first empirical study of the queries and search behavior of users in E-Com search by analyzing search log from a major E-Com search engine. The analysis results show that E-Com queries can be categorized into five categories, each with distinctive search behaviors: (1) Shallow Exploration Queries are short vague queries that a user may use initially in exploring the product space. (2) Targeted Purchase Queries are queries used by users to purchase items that they are generally familiar with, thus without much decision making. (3) Major-Item Shopping Queries are used by users to shop for a major item which is often relatively expensive and thus requires some serious exploration, but typically in a limited scope of choices. (4) Minor-Item Shopping Queries are used by users to shop for minor items that are generally not very expensive, but still require some exploration of choices. (5) Hard-Choice Shopping Queries are used by users who want to deeply explore all the candidate products before finalizing the choice often appropriate when multiple products must be carefully compared with each other. These five categories form a taxonomy for E-Com queries and can shed light on how we may develop customized search technologies for each type of search queries to improve search engine utility.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Taxonomy of Queries for E-commerce Search","journalPages":"1245-1248","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210152"],"entities":["Categorization","E-commerce payment system","Evolutionary taxonomy","Taxonomy (general)","Vagueness","Web search engine","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["385dcc1480e341435b1aa7b7a523b4c7d9563b95","7c8822e4bff8eaa454a7a89bf13c443a16a85dd6","930b48205b33f22d26de0e6f9e93dd49d90efb1d","477928d562839cfbde209501a0a8ec5212b846b7","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7"],"id":"2767c29f74f3724c1165d35def808fd038620311","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2767c29f74f3724c1165d35def808fd038620311","authors":[{"name":"Parikshit Sondhi","ids":["3267191"]},{"name":"Mohit Sharma","ids":["46320277"]},{"name":"Pranam Kolari","ids":["32634009"]},{"name":"ChengXiang Zhai","ids":["1736467"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210152"}

It takes a natural language claim as input from the user and automatically analyzes its credibility by considering relevant articles from the Web. Our system captures joint interaction between language style of articles, their stance towards a claim and the trustworthiness of the sources. In addition, extraction of supporting evidence in the form of enriched snippets makes the verdicts of CredEye transparent and interpretable.","inCitations":["134b65656d5e061c8c98332227503c407592aed6","57761435a76864b807c77a1e66ce994609bda7c7"],"pmid":"","title":"CredEye: A Credibility Lens for Analyzing and Explaining Misinformation","journalPages":"155-158","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1e38/0f2d4920aab98c1a5bf4edcd440be0dc8ebc.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kpopat/publications/www18_demo.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3186967"],"entities":["Database","Deep learning","Digital media","Distributed computing","Gerhard J.

Multi-label data stream classification is a supervised learning problem where each instance in the data stream is classified into one or more pre-defined sets of labels. Many methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, including but not limited to ensemble-based methods. Some of these ensemble-based methods are specifically designed to work with certain multi-label base classifiers; some others employ online bagging schemes to build their ensembles. In this study, we introduce a novel online and dynamically-weighted stacked ensemble for multi-label classification, called GOOWE-ML, that utilizes spatial modeling to assign optimal weights to its component classifiers. Our model can be used with any existing incremental multi-label classification algorithm as its base classifier. We conduct experiments with 4 GOOWE-ML-based multi-label ensembles and 7 baseline models on 7 real-world datasets from diverse areas of interest. Our experiments show that GOOWE-ML ensembles yield consistently better results in terms of predictive performance in almost all of the datasets, with respect to the other prominent ensemble models.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Novel Online Stacked Ensemble for Multi-Label Stream Classification","journalPages":"1063-1072","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09994","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271774","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09994v1.pdf"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Consistency model","Dynamic data","Ensemble forecasting","Experiment","Multi-label classification","Online algorithm","Relevance","Requirement","Supervised learning","Window function"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["83cd28c68b740c2d73d9aa8e730ace83fa6f8e65","6c2e32948af0134f0c3d85e8c262345568912208","b5c13bda74db14b90d5a40da5d4155c7e1e473eb","697349e6c83b1eb71ce41995e97345c0a41fb131","896b9c1551b7ffa347baed144582ec3b5d88f703","0bfc6add0390f1b4cfbd0e90ac71475cca88b2d5","e29d7acaba4b81b0022dff238f93006dca6d0224","51989e4f646ad45afc35c42edc0afd970a011fb4","3b3b818a22e06720c4f88c4f1e762c866618da9e","bd6172ae040aedd42f2ae3827ddb49ec0183ec7c","6b5691db1e3a79af5e3c136d2dd322016a687a0b","d23b1f704aa817911ee8630063a9d7f6cc0aa92b","26ba1eefa161daa6c7d8bee38c72bbad7534af0e","1f5d1767c57a7a5ba46c316938b65efa8b239350","572b7f31aee095262057fe17b181ac262eb94995","7ad8d4ec8dbde2cfa8decb0c1b29106fac23ca2a","ff99bf0b9bbc3878e7027878039fc84a7a91d2b7","ce578c7ad74b6ef1359cd7aa8cba597af5b30b0a","07e9728aeeb20bc33ea636d97464704c9cb828ae","4dccf498ba10e4bf4706b7a216345c1f8b31d098","a9c247aa66b49d253170400a3524ff2a4be85141","bfb4879f64c5cccd06b2b28102919a84917ea9a0","32093be6d9bf5038adb5b5b8b8e8a9b62001643c","17642d30fb4f583524fa1748c8a60467cdf127b1","34934e9d9ef2f9a6d930023479a25c851855f25e","da8bb82ce64dc6056685623f1a2202ae67fd5c3d","2abe6b9ea1b13653b7384e9c8ef14b0d87e20cfc","29e9a2739bb96b1d3d3a3270d661c61511b41699","1b3dfa08444f249934d61ab01139b9eafa64f94c","b39ebb8a14c68daa1d9c560fc342be24cf9e8660","39b6fc834b85cf181339474486873b4866959455","318a81acdd15a0ab2f706b5f53ee9d4d5d86237f","27db63ab642d9c27601a9311d65b63e2d2d26744","a23a6d28b91addda7162bbf3a0bd8cde54cbec90","1bb07913e346f33f5e3af105e2184d314f1a6cc1"],"id":"e46d8ccb0e06dc7b25724dbcaddf23edaba8e364","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e46d8ccb0e06dc7b25724dbcaddf23edaba8e364","authors":[{"name":"Alican Büyükçakir","ids":["51447696"]},{"name":"Hamed R.

We hypothesize that harnessing the Semantic Web standards to enable automatic combination of Linked Data and non-RDF Web APIs data could trigger novel cross-fertilization scenarios. To achieve this goal, we define the SPARQLMicro-Service architecture. A SPARQL micro-service is a lightweight, task-specific SPARQL endpoint that provides access to a small, resource-centric, virtual graph, while dynamically assigning dereferenceable URIs to Web API resources that do not have URIs beforehand. The graph is delineated by the Web API service being wrapped, the arguments passed to this service, and the restricted types of RDF triples that this SPARQLmicro-service is designed to spawn. In this context, we argue that full SPARQL expressiveness can be supported efficiently without jeopardizing servers availability. Eventually, we believe that an ecosystem of SPARQL micro-services could emerge from independent service providers, enabling Linked Data-based applications to glean pieces of data from a wealth of distributed, scalable and reliable services. We describe an experimentation where we dynamically augment biodiversity-related Linked Data with data from Flickr, MusicBrainz and the Macauley scientific media library.","inCitations":["6a85567f36d92dfd7dc381c189f093adf94e57b4"],"pmid":"","title":"SPARQL Micro-Services: Lightweight Integration of Web APIs and Linked Data","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3eb/af41c07f5a0d429f949166783965023279ec.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01722792/file/sparql-micro-services.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2073/article-01.pdf","http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2018/papers/LDOW2018_paper_1.pdf"],"entities":["16px|favicon of MusicBrainzMusicBrainz","Amplitude-shift keying","Application programming interface","Communication endpoint","Ecosystem","Flickr","Human-readable medium","Hypermedia","Linked data","Loose coupling","Microservices","Paging","Query string","Read-write memory","Resource Description Framework","SPARQL","Scalability","Self-documenting code","Semantic Web","Spawn (computing)","Triplestore","Uniform Resource Identifier","Web API","Web application","Web standards","World Wide Web","z/TPF"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c728eb17485d733c4611f8405300ac2a6a345168","03c383aa1c014eba616f9adafaa11c31bcb9aa0f","65456391b58d4fab3899d370770e2b20a3a0f085","5f3d877bcd2211efa77a3f53882db098385dbf9c","9149edb98db02ebd804644b348b490b2d747070f","96b23780cf17e06aaeb666b653420acc6c5228c6","5630425a9960dce98d9f6a13518fafb0e615b870","6196e723d435066c32d0f1e6afcfa0bf380cddc8","fcb2b2a6284922622538b8b5283e4edbb1de68aa","99e0d0d59ac64e78fcb1327450795fd04b248f95","d6cbac396b1e487f497aba7472bb800fd2780f48","6f294df1ea316c73e68ebaaf7966661daa13cfe2","4a109ebd285f579e3daa3a11bafdb9b7894cbd0b","93b4d338320325bcd5b76b4d28ad009aa5351cd4","ad97d82a8c9fa4cca880efd5d29de8ea5c4b3283","47b10d0afece1e971485f4f259beca506a566b5c","33af1270e7e4e6cdfd36ea56d7149c14e68f2e68","c03fb26eee5c97d9866d2545b42f7cc2fa046f36","2f5d26b6c12ea01c10f0d69b4eab8e582205971b","fde872d2334f1da6bb4e18c64d3c8039bf788a8c"],"id":"59694737563388ecaf57d591e417f2fd6ab4a569","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/59694737563388ecaf57d591e417f2fd6ab4a569","authors":[{"name":"Franck Michel","ids":["35202970"]},{"name":"Catherine Faron-Zucker","ids":["1700517"]},{"name":"Fabien L.

When the basis for similarity is a set of object-to-object relationships, it is natural to rely on graph-theoretic measures. One seminal technique for measuring the structural-context similarity between a pair of graph vertices is SimRank, whose underlying intuition is that two objects are similar if they are connected by similar objects. However, by design, SimRank as well as its variants capture only a single view or perspective of similarity. Meanwhile, in many real-world scenarios, there emerge multiple perspectives of similarity, i.e., two objects may be similar from one perspective, but dissimilar from another. For instance, human subjects may generate varied, yet valid, clusterings of objects. In this work, we propose a graph-theoretic similarity measure that is natively multiperspective. In our approach, the observed object-to-object relationships due to various perspectives are integrated into a unified graph-based representation, stylised as a hypergraph to retain the distinct perspectives. We then introduce a novel model for learning and reflecting diverse similarity perceptions given the hypergraph, yielding the similarity score between any pair of objects from any perspective. In addition to proposing an algorithm for computing the similarity scores, we also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the algorithm. Experiments on public datasets show that the proposed model deals better with multiperspectivity than the baselines.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Multiperspective Graph-Theoretic Similarity Measure","journalPages":"1223-1232","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271758"],"entities":["Algorithm","Baseline (configuration management)","Graph theory","Matrix multiplication","Relevance","Semantic similarity","SimRank","Similarity measure"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["48b44e7fbb07cbb621f466f5e6aaa86cd2c2af44","737d7cbf3d03442f5403abb0c6d43a9ec4cd1f7e","30b9bdfc8539fe1c7710ba8decb0cdbd96408f84","375a406cfbea4e0a3affd233766e2bf974f4801e","009dbf3187862352aac542bf7d61e27bce6b27f5","99395d59f5c6d8912d17df9e923098aba336ff0d","97e51e16098f1fa37cd2658e5bf6fe27bb117c7b","6630c1e12dbcd502ccea0f7df0fb3b0b931be99e","20dc1890ca65e01856f31edf10126c2ad67e9d04","87048df918c34b662bc0d28894efa430d70a9206","a1b297de50f1678dd97e36b13559627640354914","49ea547c42c5a9ee8ffeb37fd1068ad114eeb841","96597c788586cb057099595cbbd24d8404e339f8","1dd8db60043f51c04eb7200915ebd253d2fabf64","2d3f9a12027c49c732714d58840e343d42904b9d","8404b11f591bb378ed82a2277bc340e5eeeaa8d1","3255117e4af75be6e4e4d451a9cf51cb7cc20b20","b29bf8f6900b4b0258397f73957eabd1bb977ef4","5880b9bc3f75f4649b8ec819c3f983a14fca9927","cd57884a7abe70c1af96342bbc574c59636f80a1","241d682c29574ea2462fe9ec8f7f80cbf2f537ea"],"id":"c585b7762ea29cc015a8740bf9446f9b9dc2f40c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c585b7762ea29cc015a8740bf9446f9b9dc2f40c","authors":[{"name":"Dung D.

In this setting, the query image shows a fashion product that the user likes and the query text allows to change certain product attributes to fit the product to the user's desire. Multimodal search gives users the means to clearly express what they are looking for. This is in contrast to current e-commerce search mechanisms, which are cumbersome and often fail to grasp the customer's needs. Multimodal search requires intermodal representations of visual and textual fashion attributes which can be mixed and matched to form the user's desired product, and which have a mechanism to indicate when a visual and textual fashion attribute represent the same concept. With a neural network, we induce a common, multimodal space for visual and textual fashion attributes where their inner product measures their semantic similarity. We build a multimodal retrieval model which operates on the obtained intermodal representations and which ranks images based on their relevance to a multimodal query. We demonstrate that our model is able to retrieve images that both exhibit the necessary query image attributes and satisfy the query texts. Moreover, we show that our model substantially outperforms two state-of-the-art retrieval models adapted to multimodal fashion search.","inCitations":["15396d785fbbc977957565d3d7478a18672cb83b","246e36e9a46caba26fd4649ab651d164d7cbe25b","02019b7f146cdf81ae899f146731618e3f9f6b9d"],"pmid":"","title":"Web Search of Fashion Items with Multimodal Querying","journalPages":"342-350","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159716"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Clickstream","E-commerce","Multimodal interaction","Programming paradigm","Relevance","Semantic similarity","Smartphone","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["108961c7366e36825ffed94ac9eab603e05b6bc6","9ebfce7a20c19ca5233b83a28a5743354fb1ecda","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","6b271a78cc197af75954b2c612d2e0b17ebf0207","9c62918ff8a6e2628872ee1b011ec230937ada41","24115d209e0733e319e39badc5411bbfd82c5133","96a00792136b92b3e9f600888f6fa33c9ca13a1b","0c12cbb9b9740dfa2816b8e5cde69c2f5a715c58","89588a697c8b81e38d3793db5055a65c4abc4845","722fcc35def20cfcca3ada76c8dd7a585d6de386","782188821963304fb78791e01665590f0cd869e8","09fa54f1ab7aaa83124d2415bfc6eb51e4b1f081","28bece702ab7ca2b7c51c778ecbc126acdbf78a9","1c404de2c85a1b58cf7048ca645de6d392358779","11da2d589485685f792a8ac79d4c2e589e5f77bd","212fc5ddeb4416aa7e1435f4c69391d0ad4fb18d","4a074c3ea6c0844da34f1b42a000f09a667d5cc0","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2"],"id":"4267178106cef2e77284bde309dfaaf9fd46a91b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4267178106cef2e77284bde309dfaaf9fd46a91b","authors":[{"name":"Katrien Laenen","ids":["35301620"]},{"name":"Susana Zoghbi","ids":["3348963"]},{"name":"Marie-Francine Moens","ids":["1802161"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159716"}

These frameworks are evaluated on prototype systems based on a centralized design and suffer from limited scalability. A common way to enhance system scalability is to adopt a distributed approach. Moreover, the study of applying distributed solution for expressive RDF stream reasoning is still missing. In this paper, we explore the ability of modern Big Data platform to handle highly expressive temporal Datalog/Answer Set Programming(ASP) over RDF data streams. In order to achieve our goal, we first discuss some key features to parallelize Datalog/ASP program, and we associate these features to the two well known distributed stream processing models, namely Bulk Synchronous Processing (BSP) and Record-at-A-Time (RAT). We build a technical demonstrator called BigSR on top of Spark(BSP) and Flink(RAT) to support our evaluations, and identify the pros and cons of each model. Our experiments show that, BigSR achieves high throughput beyond million-triples per second using a rather small cluster of machines.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"RDF Stream Reasoning via Answer Set Programming on Modern Big Data Platform","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e6fc/16a8226b8faf0dfbdad3a7b0af857c6f646f.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-51.pdf"],"entities":["Answer set programming","Big data","Centralized computing","Datalog","Experiment","Prototype","Resource Description Framework","Scalability","Stream processing","Throughput"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2234129b45e9e2ea592e5f92c09623167ee44394","367a8522cca4eecb4f9d4471c73df5a08a95e446","0558c94a094158ecd64f0d5014d3d9668054fb97","2c278bbee6a0bf695e46d23a5bec4b3bc8a0449b"],"id":"e6fc16a8226b8faf0dfbdad3a7b0af857c6f646f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e6fc16a8226b8faf0dfbdad3a7b0af857c6f646f","authors":[{"name":"Xiangnan Ren","ids":["3464627"]},{"name":"Olivier Curé","ids":["2141773"]},{"name":"Hubert Naacke","ids":["3045686"]},{"name":"Guohui Xiao","ids":["34363270"]}],"doi":""}

However, existing RDF engines return only reachability of the entities ignoring the intermediate nodes in the path. If the paths are output, they are too many, which makes it difficult for users to find the most relevant paths. To address this issue, we propose a generalized topk ranking technique that balances the trade-off between relevance and diversity. We propose a shortest path based relevance scoring in combination with several path similarity measures for diversification. With preliminary experiments and examples, we show that our diversification strategies provide more novel paths as our technique prioritizes diversity over path length.","inCitations":["24d9e02f44a7f6e862f7cfc5e45527ec9bf2a382"],"pmid":"","title":"Top-K Diversification for Path Queries in Knowledge Graphs","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9fa2/3285dbcdafa1866aa6a83cebf31089468495.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-01.pdf"],"entities":["Diversification (finance)","Entity","Experiment","Reachability","Relevance","Requirement prioritization","SPARQL","Shortest path problem"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9d11379f2087e25f8f4d5a6264290895e437f118","b9e43395663f74c581982e9ca97a0d7057a0008c","6c5b5adc3830ac45bf1d764603b1b71e5f729616","f67bbf81162b62c3ff9c8c1a93e2cec15cb98da6","24d9e02f44a7f6e862f7cfc5e45527ec9bf2a382","c669c8cb28c6d219419e0e904a795164e8c6be05","2b2c30dfd3968c5d9418bb2c14b2382d3ccc64b2"],"id":"9fa23285dbcdafa1866aa6a83cebf31089468495","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9fa23285dbcdafa1866aa6a83cebf31089468495","authors":[{"name":"Christian Aebeloe","ids":["51198806"]},{"name":"Vinay Setty","ids":["2852530"]},{"name":"Gabriela Montoya","ids":["34872616"]},{"name":"Katja Hose","ids":["1682407"]}],"doi":""}

Considerable efforts have gone into devising effective quality control mechanisms that identify or discourage cheat submissions in an attempt to improve the quality of noisy crowd judgments. Besides purposeful cheating, there is another source of noise that is often alluded to but insufficiently studied: Cognitive biases. \n This paper investigates the prevalence and effect size of a range of common cognitive biases on a standard relevance judgment task.

Web data could therefore reveal some private/sensitive information about users based on inference analysis. The possible identification of information corresponding to a single individual by an inference attack holds true even if the user identifiers are encoded or removed in the Web data. Several works have been done on improving privacy of Web data through obfuscation methods [6, 8, 12, 21]. However, these methods are neither comprehensive, generic to be applicable to any Web data, nor effective against adversarial attacks. To this end, we propose a privacy-aware obfuscation method for Web data addressing these identified drawbacks of existing methods. We use probabilistic methods to predict privacy risk of Web data that incorporates all key privacy aspects, which are uniqueness, uniformity, and linkability of Web data. The Web data with high predicted risk are then obfuscated by our method to minimize the privacy risk using semantically similar data. Our method is resistant against adversary who has knowledge about the datasets and model learned risk probabilities using differential privacy-based noise addition.

In order to reduce storage requirements, we propose a dictionary-based compression approach for the recently proposed bitwise data-structure BitFunnel, which makes use of a Bloom filter. Compression is achieved through storing frequently occurring blocks in a dictionary. Infrequently occurring blocks (those which are not represented in the dictionary) are instead referenced using similar blocks that are in the dictionary, introducing additional false positive errors. We further introduce a docID reordering strategy to improve compression. Experimental results indicate an improvement in compression by 27% to 30%, at the expense of increasing the query processing time by 16% to 48% and increasing the false positive rate by around 7.6 to 10.7 percentage points.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Index Compression for BitFunnel Query Processing","journalPages":"921-924","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210086"],"entities":["Bitwise operation","Bloom filter","Data dictionary","Data structure","Database","Inverted index","Requirement","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"54dfd9689745a6b846f27e7e25280fd3ed444fef","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/54dfd9689745a6b846f27e7e25280fd3ed444fef","authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Liu","ids":["1704461"]},{"name":"Zhaohua Zhang","ids":["7969749"]},{"name":"Boran Hou","ids":["35318049"]},{"name":"Rebecca J.

In particular, the massive data generated from users\u2019 usage logs provide the possibilities for stakeholders to know better about consumer behaviors with the aid of data mining. In this paper, we examine the consumer behaviors across multiple platforms based on a largescale mobile Internet dataset from a major telecom operator, which covers 9.8 million users from two regions among which 1.4 million users have visited e-commerce platforms within one week of our study. We make several interesting observations and examine users\u2019 cultural differences from different regions. Our analysis shows among the multiple e-commerce platforms available, most mobile users are loyal to their favorable sites; people (60%) tend to make quick decisions to buy something online, which usually takes less than half an hour. Furthermore, we find that people in residential areas are much easier to perform purchases than in business districts and purchases take place during non-work time. Meanwhile, people with medium socioeconomic status like browsing and purchasing on e-commerce platforms, while people with high and low socioeconomic status are much easier to conduct purchases online. We also show the predictability of cross-platform shopping ∗1. H. Huang and H.

Handling missing values is one of the most key aspects in data mining, as it can seriously impact the performance of predictive models. In this paper we proposed a unified Boosting framework that consolidates model construction and missing value handling. At each Boosting iteration, weights are assigned to both the samples and features. The sample weights make difficult samples become the learning focus, while the feature weights enable critical features to be compensated by less critical features when they are unavailable. A weak classifier that abstains (i.e, produce no prediction when required feature value is missing) is learned on a data subset determined by the feature weights.

Researchers and governments are investing in the creation of advanced information technologies to identify and counter extremism through intelligent large-scale analysis of online data. However, to the best of our knowledge, these technologies are neither based on, nor do they take advantage of, the existing theories and studies of radicalisation. In this paper we propose a computational approach for detecting and predicting the radicalisation influence a user is exposed to, grounded on the notion of 'roots of radicalisation' from social science models. This approach has been applied to analyse and compare the radicalisation level of 112 pro-ISIS vs.112 \"general\" Twitter users. Our results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in detecting and predicting radicalisation influence, obtaining up to 0.9 F-1 measure for detection and between 0.7 and 0.8 precision for prediction. While this is an initial attempt towards the effective combination of social and computational perspectives, more work is needed to bridge these disciplines, and to build on their strengths to target the problem of online radicalisation.","inCitations":["073d79654e2872f7fa8ae1ac9d7444c7235e7f83","01c2b1244c333cae95319b3cc47a5505da0f519c"],"pmid":"","title":"Understanding the Roots of Radicalisation on Twitter","journalPages":"1-10","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201082","http://oro.open.ac.uk/54344/1/wbsc052-fernandezA-hm.pdf"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3380b22183868284c29bd79609a60f3a53c1f90a","73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","59cad32c41b3e98a3f114bc08b0b17bf17921c07","ebee2589f05208daba9f7b3a62b2a6b2c6c196c1","d7e2f20d6d1cb29d5c45d6052d9fd435ef07e857","d29babcdccd1b0a5e4232623513633f6813d847a","15354f8c637eb2150f6d496c42b4e99592bacb84","41245aa31780116ae14cab0290841070779bf4a5","7d38246b2118cce7f234256a0874e10350e8078f","24436217c44e6f0d7a20f7f4c1549af67e9dc0a8","032b9a67c42cf6804ed430d42a45e00ca599cd6a","a7d778b1d33ee784b1fd3e90e0f72b2d4b63f6ca","f4c78d3c9995d93ade6100540f0121ef1474b925","5817f5d2288e2eacff71704eb940d165e5f07d50","4a025d8dae9665b7cb9fbdb59009c5eb40bf6538","fe12d70b0d849fb4d80153bc2acd11a6d4125ecc","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","d1e58edd2a5fe9b4e405917452067a3c9e36ca97","854808e0acb84509d8abf50a14fea3d488bcd6af","68ff581ba7162f5c2e809c72823bf418a58d4ff9","48f3552e17bcebb890e4b1f19c9a2c1fa362800f"],"id":"6771746447702bfb16c65f8e2ed4f1f6d3d3dfe3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6771746447702bfb16c65f8e2ed4f1f6d3d3dfe3","authors":[{"name":"Miriam Fernández","ids":["33402800"]},{"name":"Moizzah Asif","ids":["41129051"]},{"name":"Harith Alani","ids":["2798006"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201082"}

Through hundreds of functions that provide access to a vast wealth of structured and semi-structured data, the terminal is able to satisfy a wide range of information needs. Users can find what they need by constructing queries, plotting charts, creating alerts, and so on. Until recently, most queries to the terminal were constructed through dedicated GUIs. For instance, if users wanted to screen for technology companies that met certain criteria, they would specify the criteria by filling out a form via a sequence of interactions with GUI elements such as drop-down lists, checkboxes, radio and toggle buttons, etc. To facilitate information retrieval in the terminal, we are equipping it with the ability to understand and answer queries expressed in natural language. Our QA (question answering) systems map structurally complex questions like the above to a logical meaning representation which can then be translated to an executable query language (such as SQL or SPARQL). At that point we can execute the queries against a suitable back end, obtain the results, and present them to the users. Adding a natural-language interface to a data repository introduces usability challenges of its own, chief amongst them being this: How can the user know what the system can and cannot understand and answer (without needing to undergo extensive training)? We can unpack this question into two separate parts: 1) How can we convey the full range of the system's abilities? 2) How can we convey its limitations? We use auto-complete as a tool to help meet both challenges. Specifically, the first question pertains to the general issue of discoverability: We want at least some of the suggested completions to act as vehicles for discovering data and functionality of which users may have not been previously aware. The second question pertains to expectation management. Naturally, no QA system can attain perfect performance; limiting factors include representational shortcomings and various kinds of incompleteness of the underlying data sources, as well as NLP technology limitations. We want to stop generating completions as a signal indicating that we are not able to understand and/or answer what is being typed.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Auto-completion for Question Answering Systems at Bloomberg","journalPages":"1351-1352","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210204"],"entities":["Bloomberg Terminal","Chart","Discoverability","Executable","Feature toggle","Front and back ends","Graphical user interface","Information needs","Information retrieval","Information source","Interaction","Natural language processing","Query language","Question answering","Research data archiving","SPARQL","SQL","Semi-structured data","Semiconductor industry","Software quality assurance","Usability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["03b590937da780cc92ff57ffbfa6e48d0c5b022f","593d514bf119316842185c32639e3478edcdb849","2a6a2aa21b266e463eaeca267440b8cadf2d85e0","6ff05febf5beeb158c654117496a324eb0a6c13e","816749906e5e608c0d7df1b799088dc047cd85e2","6ba48400a8740e67ae58bac28ebf81d96bc67fbd","74ea25f13dea3512971825ffbeb057a6650e1b93","15156983f24dea8777f772587625e82af30901aa"],"id":"6a3dcecb1f96319f040ac8df892fe11bb66f3b14","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6a3dcecb1f96319f040ac8df892fe11bb66f3b14","authors":[{"name":"Konstantine Arkoudas","ids":["1757320"]},{"name":"Mohamed Yahya","ids":["1795788"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210204"}

The quality of the model or accuracy of prediction plays a vital role in related applications like recommendation, advertisement displaying, searching, etc. For large scale systems with a massive number of users, beside the pure prediction performance, there are other practical factors like training and prediction latency, memory overhead, that must be optimized to ensure smooth operation of the system. We propose a fast linear computational framework to handle a vast number of second order crossed features with dimensionality reduction. By leveraging the training and serving system architecture, we shift heavy calculation burden from online serving to offline preprocessing, at the cost of a reasonable amount of memory overhead. The experiments on a 15-day data trace from Tencent MyApp shows that our proposed framework can achieve comparable prediction performance to much complex models like the field-aware factorization machine (FFM) while being served in 2 ms with a reasonable amount of memory overhead.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Fast Linear Computational Framework for User Action Prediction in Tencent MyApp","journalPages":"2047-2055","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272015"],"entities":["Computation","Dimensionality reduction","Experiment","Feature vector","Online and offline","Overhead (computing)","Preprocessor","Recommender system","Systems architecture","Tencent QQ"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["18f431a66df3dab70c401eb4b0c9d17393f1f736","13e650e1297dd7c037bb7b81743aa78aa5aea9b2","09c162757d253a61b4b20f975cea58a1554a8917","1bc072002d97808340b312b69427baf2dc9fcb8e","34e9cfe143f8eb2e3c451c165ac53eec0a9a0449","34ddb4d6b98a45b24b9645b5c52b1d3424ba24f5","151313065d71b49dbf07289c002c887d7b5a0a6b","9140d23754eac274e8829c47f15bcde7fea1f9b1","760948698540118031e590fbc884fcea209f9104","daf9ed5dc6c6bad5367d7fd8561527da30e9b8dd","4402c6c8445f17f4161e0f64573b7e28df1ca180","1ff88585ce3fd5fdaab6573722d4874641359951","10b03c9611a31568082ff2c11cee824287204355","bcdce6325b61255c545b100ef51ec7efa4cced68","221b42bb9b7fb5fb54ed22c22f9f025a1aed74aa","657fbf29ea0b4904a3e98d1556f9acf38dddae5f","75d7d4f30fa3890ad29fa5af2aefbb57d436e584","577542a0017657546c9d6f5e7c983306c54f7662"],"id":"155889131b3d74b905b795f1ee7c7a2cfff23689","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/155889131b3d74b905b795f1ee7c7a2cfff23689","authors":[{"name":"Yaochen Hu","ids":["2911895"]},{"name":"Di Niu","ids":["1714907"]},{"name":"Jianming Yang","ids":["49499912"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3272015"}

Knowledge graphs need to be easily maintainable and usable in sometimes complex application settings. Often, scaling knowledge graph updates can require developing a knowledge curation pipeline that either replaces the graph wholesale whenever updates are made, or requires detailed tracking of knowledge provenance across multiple data sources. Fig. 1 shows how Whyis provides a semantic analysis ecosystem: an environment that supports research and development of semantic analytics for which we previously had to build custom applications [3,4]. Users interact through a suite of knowledge graph views driven by the node type and view requested in the URL. Knowledge curation methods include Semantic ETL, external linked data mapping,and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Autonomous inference agents expand the available knowledge using traditional deductive reasoning as well as inductive methods that can include predictive models, statistical reasoners, and machine learning. Whyis is used in a number of areas today, including nanopolymers, spectrum policy, and health informatics. We demonstrate Whyis by creating and deploying an example Biological Knowledge Graph (BioKG), using data from DrugBank and Uniprot1, and briefly discuss benefits of using our approach over a conventional knowledge graph pipeline.","inCitations":["40892c844ab0ba2deaddb8ce0933691153faf0fa"],"pmid":"","title":"The Whyis Knowledge Graph Framework in Action","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a5f3/b8edbd37262dd580effc506e679863cde51d.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-40.pdf"],"entities":["Digital curation","DrugBank","Ecosystem","Image scaling","Informatics","Knowledge Graph","Linked data","Machine learning","Natural language processing","Nonlinear gameplay","Predictive modelling","Semantic Web","Semantic analytics","Statistical learning theory","Statistical model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1b0ae7920b299486a881af1dba00f67dae2584f5","89982bec1d3e326375a0419d9eda27609388dcc6","db017de0190cd941db7b76226047de8f3d8afae8"],"id":"a5f3b8edbd37262dd580effc506e679863cde51d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a5f3b8edbd37262dd580effc506e679863cde51d","authors":[{"name":"Jim McCusker","ids":["38404584"]},{"name":"Sabbir M.

We employ a general framework of reinforcement mechanism design, which uses deep reinforcement learning to design efficient algorithms, taking the strategic behaviour of the sellers into account. Specifically, we model the impression allocation problem as a Markov decision process, where the states encode the history of impressions, prices, transactions and generated revenue and the actions are the possible impression allocations in each round. To tackle the problem of continuity and high-dimensionality of states and actions, we adopt the ideas of the DDPG algorithm to design an actor-critic policy gradient algorithm which takes advantage of the problem domain in order to achieve convergence and stability. We evaluate our proposed algorithm, coined IA(GRU), by comparing it against DDPG, as well as several natural heuristics, under different rationality models for the sellers we assume that sellers follow well-known no-regret type strategies which may vary in their degree of sophistication. We find that IA(GRU) outperforms all algorithms in terms of the total revenue.","inCitations":["a940bdb026b2442dbf91320f8993e25aecda27f8","c58595ae51cde5baa0b1fcd8a44fe7d3588178be","54b0e71772f4c1f9e7c254faf51d3a02faef290b","effe25c76e5a9506883af58e1854710d993bfc04","b7457e3865313cf33289ff48ddf73759301ccb5b","5956c34032126185d8ad19695e4a1a191c08b5a1","1a8192f0476084c6033b87fc059e585302145eef","9e0c041f52be40b3e44f3672a4183de6e83a2525","019b2b2c950c84944c1ee1ee71dc26c1b0893bb4"],"pmid":"","title":"Reinforcement Mechanism Design for e-commerce","journalPages":"1339-1348","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9657/a7c8a7f9220b644389657576fa72e896c172.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07607v3.pdf","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1708.07607","http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07607","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186039"],"entities":["Algorithm","E-commerce","ENCODE","Gradient descent","Heuristic (computer science)","Machine learning","Markov chain","Markov decision process","Problem domain","Rationality","Reinforcement learning","Scott continuity","Taobao Marketplace"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["687d0e59d5c35f022ce4638b3e3a6142068efc94","8d11fd768258613bfff29dffba93a99e4128ff0a","177f18c0f03099ac875dc56d7aba8d8185cbe707","874a07d36b6acbfcd2acf38f6896f8b1b81c0591","1064c3f020c99d04797050689aee193381370b7b","51594045b98200c45df18680e399494791e45765","02d1105bec3877ed8cd2d28f76b67ae8ba3f2331","1827de6fa9c9c1b3d647a9d707042e89cf94abf0","23178ec3264cb1c7e1b18ef2807939f4d68dde1e","36209da01ff06d4889f9472839a3373e1f211be3","160315c07d18fe785aff07f50c9e44319a0af0cb","f4bd6691f59eb95c58b6d104d5122158ab7ddaa4","3936e6f0a64b43f7d0e57cd83b05eb1333733104","0c69be26a6b08fcb0be75260df14e87a4d25e68d","3a3c6dff4adb7bcf3d5f7368c5167f6dcffc2568","667fb84bfca10bec165f9e2cca3e21f5e4829ca7","094ca99cc94e38984823776158da738e5bc3963d","1bbb6384076ff6aeb0d1a2c499a6026959671a9c","b1d730ad00d877b5ac6a1abb720483945a1904fd","077323cbd1917be42e89acd55d23e2024fe63bbc","24b3be2500a2eedd3e98a0b40ac6ffd58f3980d6","43f296d5fa2101433417b7a0a514eb852893d5af","1e821d9abe62573bd3b6e7064dabdad296728bda","3b9732bb07dc99bde5e1f9f75251c6ea5039373e","3a35752604f73d1e69fd91e1faa1976bb2599634","bcfe915d5983dffbfe95801e9e6757205b3a4723","79d3c8b1f7723e3c023c09d909bec0277351a356","1b3c86ad6c149941750d97bd72b6b0122c1d8b5e","340f48901f72278f6bf78a04ee5b01df208cc508","5ec9ed5c9936c069fa554603aa773d3ee036b4ac","179033107b5ef8fc7cb9872ccef303e227d807b1","1554d6787b88b24cde34f398a330e1ad4d30b634","74fde3e7c6fca115f36b40083311d76eaedc088f","27f43696f2ae19846744b66cd97f0f93897102e7","175b1cc4a0bd918d3a788a8533017f5f5191feb9","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","24f1a3ec9d02abcd3b5ed7f511b9d8017213954a","019b2b2c950c84944c1ee1ee71dc26c1b0893bb4"],"id":"357f330f538d1cca64c18c79526d162c1c84e052","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/357f330f538d1cca64c18c79526d162c1c84e052","authors":[{"name":"Qingpeng Cai","ids":["3431358"]},{"name":"Aris Filos-Ratsikas","ids":["2940984"]},{"name":"Pingzhong Tang","ids":["34198278"]},{"name":"Yiwei Zhang","ids":["40048508"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186039"}

We are proposing a metric capable of capturing the differences between organic and coordinated posts, which is based on the estimated probability of coincidentally repeating a word sequence.

The development and evaluation of IR systems relies on the availability of suitable datasets or test collections. These typically consist of a target document collection, example search queries representative of those that users of the system to be developed, are expected to enter, and relevance data indicating which documents in the collection are relevant to the information needed as expressed in each query. Public research in IR has focused on popular content, e.g. news corpora or web content, for which average users can pose queries expressing information needs and judge the relevance of retrieved documents. This is not the case for professional search applications, for example legal, medical, financial search where domain experts are required for these tasks. We describe our experiences from the development of a professional legal IR application employing semantic search technologies. Our activities indicate the vital need for close interaction between the professionals for which the application is being developed and the IR researchers throughout the development life cycle of the search system. Such engagement is vital in order for the IR researchers to understand the working practices of the professional searchers, the specifications of their information needs and the domain in which they are searching, and to study how they engage and interact with information. A key reason to seek to understand these topics so deeply is to facilitate meaningful evaluation of the effectiveness of IR technologies as components in the system being developed.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Challenges in the Development of Effective Systems for Professional Legal Search","journalPages":"29-34","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a0aa/85560d94a194a44395dbe49c5a60f6d9b2e4.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2127/paper5-profs.pdf"],"entities":["Archive","Information needs","Information retrieval","News aggregator","Relevance","Semantic search","Software development process","Text corpus","Web content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","c029baf196f33050ceea9ecbf90f054fd5654277","7f45e907a56ae9ea5e860f730c3b7bc74d25a85c","aad41c3828185b8d3e89b73867476b63ad0b9383","e50a316f97c9a405aa000d883a633bd5707f1a34","b8a41e869b643e981377940143a7927cff67c792","c6ea8a45cba8980e94dd9626b7fa391084447c40"],"id":"a0aa85560d94a194a44395dbe49c5a60f6d9b2e4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a0aa85560d94a194a44395dbe49c5a60f6d9b2e4","authors":[{"name":"Piyush Arora","ids":["50128338"]},{"name":"Murhaf Hossari","ids":["51047601"]},{"name":"Alfredo Maldonado","ids":["31617113"]},{"name":"Clare Conran","ids":["40907323"]},{"name":"Gareth J.

As a matter of fact, scientometrics and informetrics systems of all kinds have to separate the grain form the chaff. Among others, fields like Information Retrieval, network analysis and natural language processing may offers answers to deal with this kind of problems. Through several emblematic case studies (fake researcher, generated papers, paper mills), we show evidences of attempts to game indicators together with automatic ways to detect them (automatic detection of generated papers, errors detection.

We are devoted to modulating the comments in a vivid \u201cnetizen\u201d style which reflects the culture in a designated social community and hopes to facilitate more engagement with users. In this work, we design a novel framework that consists of three major components: (1) We construct a large-scale clothing dataset named NetiLook, which contains 300K posts (photos) with 5M comments to discover netizen-style comments. (2) We propose three unique measures to estimate the diversity of comments. (3) We bring diversity by marrying topic models with neural networks to make up the insufficiency of conventional image captioning works. Experimenting over Flickr30k and our NetiLook datasets, we demonstrate our proposed approaches benefit fashion photo commenting and improve image captioning tasks both in accuracy and diversity.","inCitations":["ddfab4096ee7af3f83c7be1dc5805388b8f49707"],"pmid":"","title":"Netizen-Style Commenting on Fashion Photos: Dataset and Diversity Measures","journalPages":"395-402","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9e1b/3cf334aead8d2c29747f6ee7d1291dd83708.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10300","https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3186354","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10300v1.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Color","Comment (computer programming)","Convergence Insufficiency","Deep learning","Experiment","Microsoft Research","National Supercomputer Centre in Sweden","Netizen","Nvidia DGX-1","Question answering","ROMP","Usability testing","Virtual community"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["26e425781e4090abfae65b5d68eac72282dd2e31","0e0900b88c33b671be5dd2ded9885b6526d6b429","052373d7fd12145c41377f9a05513596d32e409c","8ff93cfd37dced279134c9d642337a2085b31f59","a1a9527800fdf193ca98e5cba5f0602c0f1f99f5","1b9d8e45250717b9b5a62ae92ef18e3b77d59327","bf60322f83714523e2d7c1d39983151fe9db7146","a3f2059c2223344fcd0eb62f3785a75871ab6835","05014b04223562c7c7485a1277552564d0ddc6de","7b8833ee8d9a78f9bf0696527ac68c5e5d957fb7","910eb7a8c3f175a9b71680f70303751726bebd30","108961c7366e36825ffed94ac9eab603e05b6bc6","24115d209e0733e319e39badc5411bbfd82c5133","ab0463d8aef96697ad0e4d2c86fd1b41ffd4633d","7f9135f3584e4e1715b2990a4f389c94af0313a5","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","18010284894ed0edcca74e5bf768ee2e15ef7841","7af3084aa104760d16bb380d4d37ddac0442b850","a0dc8911c47c3d0e1643ecfaa7032cee6fb5eb64","25642be46de0f2e74e0da81a14646f8bfcc9000a","71969ee27916d545c63fe852946dd6dcc015d1a8","afbff808f4a4c6eafcce3858451b9b1a508ecba3","09fa54f1ab7aaa83124d2415bfc6eb51e4b1f081","41b2068f134adf9afb3dae2d8811e2d21f471e3d","5e0f8c355a37a5a89351c02f174e7a5ddcb98683","553ffb04c193eedde286c944f4816d46248d9822","117f164f416ea68e8b88a3005e55a39dbdf32ce4","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","7d1a7dae43b630d61d19d6cf139824380f2cf42f","af88ce6116c2cd2927a4198745e99e5465173783","b955969e1077ca328018c9e4dcf27b87ed9f5076","11da2d589485685f792a8ac79d4c2e589e5f77bd","a76aee280abaff82a9e576c27eb65e1b1bbbf2eb"],"id":"9e1b3cf334aead8d2c29747f6ee7d1291dd83708","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9e1b3cf334aead8d2c29747f6ee7d1291dd83708","authors":[{"name":"Wen Hua Lin","ids":["48149965"]},{"name":"Kuan-Ting Chen","ids":["1751689"]},{"name":"HungYueh Chiang","ids":["29837150"]},{"name":"Winston Hsu","ids":["31871157"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3186354"}

Even more, the opportunistic reuse of data (traces) that characterizes today\u2019s data science calls for new ways to understand and mitigate the effects of biases. Here, we discuss biases in the context of Linked Data, ontologies, and reasoning services and point to the need for both technical and social solutions. We believe that debiasing knowledge graphs will become a pressing issue as these graphs enter everyday life rapidly. This is a provocative topic, not only from a technical perspective but because it will force us as a Semantic Web community to discuss whether we want to debias in the first place and who gets a say in how to do so.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Debiasing Knowledge Graphs: Why Female Presidents are not like Female Popes","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a2a5/4b6e729edee1009c34d471250de7f322774a.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~gengchen_mai/papers/2018-ISWC18_Debiasing.pdf","http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~jano/debiasing.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/ISWC_2018_Outrageous_Ideas_paper_17.pdf"],"entities":["Data science","Experiment","Knowledge Graph","Linked data","Machine learning","Norm (social)","Ontology (information science)","Relevance","Sampling (signal processing)","Semantic Web","Shattered World","Tracing (software)","Web science"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8b463e0ef5dfdf7d01bab3b13ca50af32a7bacfa","30984f640ffc6ad624f81321ac08c6a4a66942fd","6af9b194b29aefa137d3481bdce18e48083db684","fb57ee50529075153e55a0df6ea8e4d09bcc1398","55d176b92d5740d039e1c8ebbad025d460de9ae0","274459c52103f9b7880d0697aa28755ac3366987","b23c2ab9450a371d46478780b2423e3f2045029e","25663da276c3d0d913ecf31cde5a8e7f6f19151d"],"id":"a2a54b6e729edee1009c34d471250de7f322774a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a2a54b6e729edee1009c34d471250de7f322774a","authors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Janowicz","ids":["1727108"]},{"name":"Bo Yan","ids":["47713365"]},{"name":"Blake Regalia","ids":["3404528"]},{"name":"Rui Zhu","ids":["36834091"]},{"name":"Gengchen Mai","ids":["40626717"]}],"doi":""}

Breakdowns of some relationships may cause users to leave the network hence decrease the network stability. A popular metric to measure the stability of a network is k-core, i.e., the maximal subgraph of a social network in which each node has at least k neighbors. In this paper, we propose a novel problem, called k-core minimization. Given a graph G, an integer k and a budget b, we aim to identify a set B of edges with size b, so that we can get the minimum k-core by deleting B from G. We first formally define the problem and prove its NP-hardness. Then a baseline greedy algorithm is proposed. To handle large graphs, an optimized algorithm, named KC-Edge, is developed by adopting novel pruning rules. Finally, comprehensive experiments on 6 real social networks are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"K-core Minimization: An Edge Manipulation Approach","journalPages":"1667-1670","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269254"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Degeneracy (graph theory)","Experiment","Graph (discrete mathematics)","Greedy algorithm","Maximal set","NP-hardness","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0dfc3797b46fc2c7e5847f7eb85927271dcdd1ed","e44ab9a564f7214b33decb81d6a40907430a4865","560041fd6ba3be31fb646d2dd6959bbfc68dc23b","3b8227f54a2237a0b9386d9359b7f0cf66f6af07","53dd2de778d89acc612e597f78047154bc3be560","329ff0523b59e0ee21530581f087c97fbe6c93c5","b62fadfeeeb7d960dc18779c7dbbccd62190facf","f7331752c2d0de039836dc6b7e24e4ca3bb45e7c","be6aae690e5dd26b6248f11f613ae6cc4761f69b","215aad1520ec1b087ab2ba4043f5e0ecc32e7482","3297c86404a7f779a3e9da26d355c26bd42b2cbb"],"id":"2acb61721627f02934ec685f6fd61f628136d025","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2acb61721627f02934ec685f6fd61f628136d025","authors":[{"name":"Weijie Zhu","ids":["48506822"]},{"name":"Chen Chen","ids":["39714837"]},{"name":"Xiaoyang Wang","ids":["48631781"]},{"name":"Xuemin Lin","ids":["2873542"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269254"}

Although in the literature exists a variety of techniques and strategies used as part of job recommender systems, most of them fail to recommending job vacancies that fit properly to the job seekers profiles. Thus, the contributions of this work are threefold, we: i) made publicly available a new dataset formed by a set of job seekers profiles and a set of job vacancies collected from different job search engine sites; ii) put forward the proposal of a framework for job recommendation based on professional skills of job seekers; and iii) carried out an evaluation to quantify empirically the recommendation abilities of two state-of-the-art methods, considering different configurations, within the proposed framework. We thus present a general panorama of job recommendation task aiming to facilitate research and real-world application design regarding this important issue.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Job Recommendation Based on Job Seeker Skills: An Empirical Study","journalPages":"47-51","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3d49/cb87fde48591a1c1a2ef088d885c4480adbf.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2077/paper6.pdf"],"entities":["Information overload","Personalization","Recommender system","Systems design","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ccd3f6f2606cbbda97743a4492350567702185d1","f00987c65f6e358f3bda0f8281938b473c54a2e3","2871f115e7a11c903258491c75d4171fac679344","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","e50a316f97c9a405aa000d883a633bd5707f1a34","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","c63f34bee1fb521eb8c10ca12b46c6d92bd01571"],"id":"3d49cb87fde48591a1c1a2ef088d885c4480adbf","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d49cb87fde48591a1c1a2ef088d885c4480adbf","authors":[{"name":"Jorge Carlos Valverde-Rebaza","ids":["2717691"]},{"name":"Ricardo Puma","ids":["40702655"]},{"name":"Paul Bustios","ids":["19273898"]},{"name":"Nathalia C.

In general, it is a problem of subset selection and selecting an optimal subset of documents is NP-hard. Existing methods usually formalize the problem as ranking the documents with greedy sequential document selection. At each of the ranking position the document that can provide the largest amount of additional information is selected. It is obvious that the greedy selections inevitably produce suboptimal rankings. In this paper we propose to partially alleviate the problem with a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhanced Markov decision process (MDP), referred to as M$^2$Div. In M$^2$Div, the construction of diverse ranking is formalized as an MDP process where each action corresponds to selecting a document for one ranking position. Given an MDP state which consists of the query, selected documents, and candidates, a recurrent neural network is utilized to produce the policy function for guiding the document selection and the value function for predicting the whole ranking quality. The produced raw policy and value are then strengthened with MCTS through exploring the possible rankings at the subsequent positions, achieving a better search policy for decision-making. Experimental results based on the TREC benchmarks showed that M$^2$Div can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines based on greedy sequential document selection, indicating the effectiveness of the exploratory decision-making mechanism in M$^2$Div.","inCitations":["1a8192f0476084c6033b87fc059e585302145eef"],"pmid":"","title":"From Greedy Selection to Exploratory Decision-Making: Diverse Ranking with Policy-Value Networks","journalPages":"125-134","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209979"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Bellman equation","Benchmark (computing)","Diversification (finance)","Exploratory testing","Greedy algorithm","Heuristic","Local optimum","Markov chain","Markov decision process","Monte Carlo method","Monte Carlo tree search","Multi-master replication","NP-hardness","Parsing","Recurrent neural network","Reinforcement learning","Value network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0f490e121d3dd3cf65ae45542ebab5049f85544b","129e54ee3181a6620e767504ab3f15ba7ee41a2f","05aba481e8a221df5d8775a3bb749001e7f2525e","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","349fd2000d792b53471cfd98decfd2cb5df5ac7d","af7f8cb4480e07135ccac147d06ab0d6101f3421","1f6bbd555ba4cbec2be94781242c97ac2c33ddd3","10486f0102297696f51da9f8f7c4ded4c0c49fb3","035bd1607d664b0c10143ca055f1c645b7d04a11","c3eb86975f7fc0a4aa99b8a19bf3e0cf7a3a6646","96582ccdece746962ca3e44858943ee4363f140e","56757c983518b0604d54719df85fcd0adf789044","2088c55ec3e52a8be99cd933907020c70b281383","0de29783fdd10dfcdae373724d07c9c6ea1d8be3","c669c8cb28c6d219419e0e904a795164e8c6be05","15004aadabd967ac722a28a9c3bb39cf5bc32605","ce5b0b9a74c1cbe8aa892d0ce6a731e79bff26e5","1b50c8353d9e4a241a5f4a9c0088eb9c5f593e1f","621af515b66c8b1e88aac10756879458e1856b34","65810ccd8be5010a6a4b9e51cf4b229761b15e99","2d1cfc9e81fb159967c2be8446a8e3e7b50fe36b","72b2ccd702c970c588e7f3bea01e02bf0bb726ae","08d0784e6ce948bbb1e7c966dfc05db5ff1609ee","96f0c611d68b5dac7e7ba10f66972ccdc563f1d7","375f771832f671ae1ca63ad4dba11fe082097fd6","85b055c4fc2e324e88cdfe1c20e557a33b940d7e","6712a40b544683a469c292ab5a8ae087ce217c2f","900874be4d48f919434a3107d959e57a55bc286c","24f896e584033e5aa9a20327e25de1f387c3f430","ded1fa5432e066c3a9f998bd52c6ed736068c582","e3796f39fe2623823a5d48dee2822da9502561c5","1a2207f47f0ad557efd5b338ccc765030d1fb57d","0b85053bceb83e27544abfb86afe68e29d704bc8","42771aede47980ae8eeebac246c7a8b941d11414","10205ce087b9190ac18ade8be02a660d92a6ea52","6c37a8d20ed8fbf2f5cb7dcd039b4f45c6f3498a","b5e781ec05b89255bcbf62f57e95641602e85bbe","ed5d79e21beccbc3a978ddd2cbd64a9e62df8499"],"id":"ef5cb5d49716bcd754b971a9a7303d7da2cd1036","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ef5cb5d49716bcd754b971a9a7303d7da2cd1036","authors":[{"name":"Yue Feng","ids":["49771398"]},{"name":"Jun Xu","ids":["47882783"]},{"name":"Yanyan Lan","ids":["37510256"]},{"name":"Jiafeng Guo","ids":["1777025"]},{"name":"Wei Zeng","ids":["1687907"]},{"name":"Xueqi Cheng","ids":["1717004"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3209979"}

Obtaining high quality training data is an important step towards producing an effective multi-community classifier. An efficient approach for creating such ground truth data is to extract users from existing public Twitter lists, where those lists represent different communities, e.g. a list of journalists. However, ground truth datasets obtained using such lists can be noisy, since not all users that belong to a community are good training examples for that community. In this paper, we conduct a thorough failure analysis of a ground truth dataset generated using Twitter lists. We discuss how some categories of users collected from these Twitter public lists could negatively affect the classification performance and therefore should not be used for training. Through experiments with 3 classifiers and 5 communities, we show that removing ambiguous users based on their tweets and profile can indeed result in a 10% increase in F1 performance.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"On Refining Twitter Lists as Ground Truth Data for Multi-community User Classification","journalPages":"765-772","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1261/5ddee29077c699d6b5d852bc79b87e99ba2c.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_74","https://anjiefang.github.io/papers/ting2018ecir.pdf"],"entities":["Display resolution","Experiment","Failure analysis","Ground truth","Statistical classification"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0148bbc80ea2f2526ab019a317639b4fb357f399","912c1b866c001d98f7091f8a28335f83d42e4856","05c5e1edd4153203548f895b4f007b2c78de9720","cdb328937e989ab62492e105512864d7cfff381e","b8f8980efb2684ba2a0b7ddf8ea88a9fe09f2ade","a66accffcd8b4c3ecdac3e1ffceaa46d33125921","11259931b73feac48633a4976825022e08dc4c15","9cc098409b7197748f65c9785d5978b5818211e1","0fe35d406842f054ce306ef67b20dc51a5a59dfd","6d43c41e19d994b802f5cff6fbe4e1feffd0d81f"],"id":"12615ddee29077c699d6b5d852bc79b87e99ba2c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/12615ddee29077c699d6b5d852bc79b87e99ba2c","authors":[{"name":"Ting Su","ids":["34750574"]},{"name":"Anjie Fang","ids":["31855550"]},{"name":"Richard McCreadie","ids":["1740893"]},{"name":"Craig MacDonald","ids":["2691614"]},{"name":"Iadh Ounis","ids":["1698205"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_74"}

In this paper, we explore the emergence of \"rich clubs\" in the context of shortest path based centrality metrics. We term these subgraphs of connected high closeness or high betweeness vertices as rich centrality clubs (RCC). Our experiments on real world and synthetic networks high- light the inter-relations between RCCs, expander graphs, and the core-periphery structure of the network. We show empirically and theoretically that RCCs exist, if the core-periphery structure of the network is such that each shell is an expander graph, and their density decreases from inner to outer shells. We further demonstrate that in addition to being an interesting topological feature, the presence of RCCs is useful in several appli- cations. The vertices in the subgraph forming the RCC are effective seed nodes for spreading information. Moreover, networks with RCCs are robust under perturbations to their structure. Given these useful properties of RCCs, we present a network modification model that can efficiently create a RCC within net- works where they are not present, while retaining other structural properties of the original network. The main contributions of our paper are: (i) we demonstrate that the formation of RCC is related to the core-periphery structure and particularly the expander like properties of each shell, (ii) we show that the RCC property can be used to find effective seed nodes for spreading information and for improving the resilience of the network under perturbation and, finally, (iii) we present a modification algorithm that can insert RCC within networks, while not affecting their other structural properties. Taken together, these contributions present one of the first comprehensive studies of the properties and applications of rich clubs for path based centralities.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"On Rich Clubs of Path-Based Centralities in Networks","journalPages":"567-576","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02903v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271763","http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02903"],"entities":["Algorithm","Centrality","Core-periphery structure","Emergence","Experiment","Perturbation theory","Shortest path problem","Sparse matrix","Synthetic intelligence","Vertex (geometry)","Vertex (graph theory)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a15b91e5197ebe643ced790f8de5e8519a7ceba0","3d22120ea0bcbfcf3737621acc78753a935cc6f1","00c90635ee843cc8d2dd7edee69ad4b15150ef80","404ae4a2b31d5c2184861cf702f953e47db40cab","36aafa74cf22710a98d1282439e0c14aab974931","4410f0c48f982f960a54500df7bd88e4cab88927","076c1e125ac54cc03b7d964ccc318db53c59ff1c","29d90c91f4abec31a1e995aa29b9e69ec0e4c8c2","75833c7ba072cfd4ded6eaa0424755ce3c9c36f9","b1f669d70f00c7df543dba5f9b357fcbb2646f8a","c123084d41a50cc8f189e57e57c7d94febe6f21f","83a8d59bf4cf4861295f51afcc4d48d61bd64122","2949753957a4a5fb717dd86486da7e8eb1c7e79d","972da2fc7e05abf0c132d555f0578b0a55e57ad4","372d304735a19907a5fbe6540d2c9133e7b6af8c","05434ad14ed3d0c4be16ed99232607d2b1b06c53","365daa2f8c6d61312cd57b648ca36a6e8a30c5ef","33c860b1e83ff8ebf77e72e92791473e0e49e2f0","eff3e2a802a63b15ce57498611165eccca0ddbe3","b081339697e174227e22b5d55ff40f3df7793a14","f0c9d0e896c11a8497ce8a1dc8155e1701a8c76d","2eab880a7bea0cfd32a809272bd2a75f743279a9","65da8860780f55191fbaa1e6668e5aa5a6044e82","7391aee745e2c2c4fd9ba75d39661d23dc28e8ac","d832fb2b7a72640844e1eef439c2092b35e40f60","10924940cff0dcfc16c18fde9e4e0cd034bac55c","5cd7cbc8c97bcc13376286b0a5ddf33e72d58843","ce043085587ebfa2b6dc123abf618a83840ae989","4cb722726a8729983f74707626b849f8e5d6bc5b","2cef0f9a6e614e2b456cd0d62988feeec4fd0722","83147bb295dbfd6f3c0458708e78fb420999b36a","75cb6c59ba1712b99473fa2c4cc8773ff5268f1d","106967ed3b0e7fc6259e4094ca54564b50dc56db","6d8aa2fc9e8eb4d8b3ce50e12253afa46c9dc051","6efd1674f3637b40153c5aad734f9181513c7d52","badd7d67078c2902f12398e868b4e50c8e25f4e5","121e53ccc22cbf6aa453a221fcde294b1fcffe60","a957c577c6497ae28618f83adeb78bfea9de73c1","1fda7738c68603b550eb9c84a9640ad17780db23"],"id":"2271bb1dbf474f3615c88186c024116a0f1c4585","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2271bb1dbf474f3615c88186c024116a0f1c4585","authors":[{"name":"Soumya Sarkar","ids":["11850867"]},{"name":"Sanjukta Bhowmick","ids":["1770598"]},{"name":"Animesh Mukherjee","ids":["33392067"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271763"}

This paper studies the phenomenon of political echo chambers on social media. We identify the two components in the phenomenon: the opinion that is shared (\u201cecho\u201d), and the place that allows its exposure (\u201cchamber\u201d \u2014 the social network), and examine closely at how these two components interact. We de ne a production and consumption measure for social-media users, which captures the political leaning of the content shared and received by them. By comparing the two, we nd that Twitter users are, to a large degree, exposed to political opinions that agree with their own. We also nd that users who try to bridge the echo chambers, by sharing content with diverse leaning, have to pay a \u201cprice of bipartisanship\u201d in terms of their network centrality and content appreciation. In addition, we study the role of \u201cgatekeepers,\u201d users who consume content with diverse leaning but produce partisan content (with a single-sided leaning), in the formation of echo chambers. Finally, we apply these ndings to the task of predicting partisans and gatekeepers from social and content features. While partisan users turn out relatively easy to identify, gatekeepers prove to be more challenging.

An excellent job recommender system not only enables to recommend a higher paying job which is maximally aligned with the skill-set of the current job, but also suggests to acquire few additional skills which are required to assume the new position. In this work, we created three types of information net- works from the historical job data: (i) job transition network, (ii) job-skill network, and (iii) skill co-occurrence network. We provide a representation learning model which can utilize the information from all three networks to jointly learn the representation of the jobs and skills in the shared k-dimensional latent space. In our experiments, we show that by jointly learning the representation for the jobs and skills, our model provides better recommendation for both jobs and skills.

A number of open data is released by various organisations, governments or communities. However, it is limited to discover datasets that users want, since most of data portals allow to search their datasets based on simple keywords using file names or descriptions, etc. This paper proposes a novel way for discovering disclosed government datasets by using linked data technologies. For achieving this objective, a set of datasets is collected from the public data portal in Korea, and all of data fields are extracted and transformed into linked data using an ontology model. We also provide a simple evaluation, which compares a search performance between the portal and the proposed method.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Towards a Semantic Discovery for Heterogenous Open Data by Interlinking Metadata of Datasets","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8bb2/9443c21e9f7fc8b5d4c791f4270b7232adf1.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-61.pdf"],"entities":["Information privacy","Linked data","Portals"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["243ecad5fd161e9dfccc8094e00d14bb8801e167","4b606805da01c61e4422fd90fe33877a6d71951c","2030c6474902f2048a979128a36af922fc7bf076","566da82fbd08c43e3d336abd1c2509a74146686b"],"id":"8bb29443c21e9f7fc8b5d4c791f4270b7232adf1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8bb29443c21e9f7fc8b5d4c791f4270b7232adf1","authors":[{"name":"Jiseong Son","ids":["9241028"]},{"name":"Youngsung Son","ids":["2069248"]},{"name":"Haklae Kim","ids":["39389088"]}],"doi":""}

This allows inferences of user interest on unseen objects based on distance in the embedding space. These object distances are then incorporated as features in a well-established learning to rank (LTR) framework.

We collect fourteen months of longitudinal data of online news from Unfiltered News and web search volume data from Google Trends and build a multiplex network of media attention and public attention in order to study its structural and dynamic properties. Structurally, the media attention and the public attention are both similar and different depending on the resolution of the analysis. For example, we find that 63.2% of the country-specific media and the public pay attention to different countries, but local attention flow patterns, which are measured by network motifs, are very similar. We also show that there are strong regional similarities with both media and public attention that is only disrupted by significantly major worldwide incidents (e.g., Brexit). Using Granger causality, we show that there are a substantial number of countries where media attention and public attention are dissimilar by topical interest. Our findings show that the media and public attention toward specific countries are often at odds, indicating that the public within these countries may be ignoring their country-specific news outlets and seeking other online sources to address their media needs and desires.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"What We Read, What We Search: Media Attention and Public Attention Among 193 Countries","journalPages":"893-902","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7af/0947e80f935e32f7f9d128f8aa443e92ca2a.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06437","http://www.bernardjjansen.com/uploads/2/4/1/8/24188166/p893-kwak.pdf","http://jonisalminen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/what-we-read-what-we-search.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186137","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06437v1.pdf"],"entities":["Causality","Multiplexing","Resolution (logic)","Social network","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["392ff1400f2db294703f4ccca65699e016a3d0f0","1d353ffb0cd6d4908fa8db2f28eea47fea442c3c","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","03ba84fb20cca69de43fa4e0aa1be3ca5bf8384f","4b7c5aefc11107006b5243c57a83f45e54afc8dd","ef79163aa074a91d436ca508a9231ffed6d5af2b","12d4ebe2727911fc18f1a6203dde2b1892057f83","ce69fde1bcc7e49dfc1a1df76426fdf287983bff","92963125e753336d9b603e7905072f435858c951","c2520291f381f9208746bf2b32573b6af947ddfb","0706356c9ab6014d6b04577d38289ea8328291a5","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","164f7422f2dfa481179ed34f6e180b0bb60f4174","cb55416e45475d2876e28d7e0b42851401014b1e","f6031a0a7279536a1508a4cbbec8f019b676b397","e8e0a0e96631b65a25fde6f5443323c578a1f04a","a151fcaa3d003321d6e09602a927fc434d19b032","1f5bd891dcf0ddfb9bbc2d4cba1f35557c9336b9","dc0d08dceb98c60531d06fb7ac45b384efdacc81","4491388d79328b8e4b13ec24d573e1dc71bf1154","690d1b12f1cb9f20162ec7b20669b43e72137c8d","3812a6cfddacbdb0077a824a7765574e340ae54b","aaee8976dd78a3e7ee0ad3adf05a4fcd6a73bd60","0669ec32ace971122351a120f57d05caa504a0b2"],"id":"178475d47a3a8a30d7092162edcb866529eedc0e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/178475d47a3a8a30d7092162edcb866529eedc0e","authors":[{"name":"Haewoon Kwak","ids":["2592694"]},{"name":"Jisun An","ids":["40660541"]},{"name":"Joni Salminen","ids":["2734912"]},{"name":"Soon-Gyo Jung","ids":["1861541"]},{"name":"Bernard J.

However, most existing recommender systems today are designed in the context of an offline setting. Compared with the traditional recommender systems, large-volume and high-velocity are posing severe challenges for streaming recommender systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of streaming recommendations being subject to higher input rates than they can immediately process with their available system resources (i.e., CPU and memory). In particular, we provide a principled framework called as SPMF (Stream-centered Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model), based on BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking) optimization framework, for performing efficient ranking based recommendations in stream settings. Experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the superiority of SPMF in online recommendations.","inCitations":["ab6389269fda048b8b7c941af8c59a0b3af8f544","34b9db533a1fa933a2d57e46dcc032e3d1f03ee8"],"pmid":"","title":"Streaming Ranking Based Recommender Systems","journalPages":"525-534","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210016","http://net.pku.edu.cn/daim/hongzhi.yin/papers/SIGIR18.pdf","http://net.pku.edu.cn/daim/hongzhi.yin/slides/SIGIR18-Weiqing.pdf"],"entities":["Central processing unit","Mathematical optimization","Online and offline","Recommender system","Velocity (software development)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["bc431f385822efc00541b896cc83a0972e478e01"],"id":"f41ec703f4857a3c7c861972dd9277a89655c016","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f41ec703f4857a3c7c861972dd9277a89655c016","authors":[{"name":"Weiqing Wang","ids":["47824837"]},{"name":"Hongzhi Yin","ids":["2416851"]},{"name":"Zi Xuan Huang","ids":["2484050"]},{"name":"Qinyong Wang","ids":["9418122"]},{"name":"Xingzhong Du","ids":["2742322"]},{"name":"Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen","ids":["28120037"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210016"}

By studying word evolution, we can infer social trends and language constructs over different periods of human history. However, traditional techniques such as word representation learning do not adequately capture the evolving language structure and vocabulary. In this paper, we develop a dynamic statistical model to learn time-aware word vector representation. We propose a model that simultaneously learns time-aware embeddings and solves the resulting alignment problem. This model is trained on a crawled NYTimes dataset. Additionally, we develop multiple intuitive evaluation strategies of temporal word embeddings. Our qualitative and quantitative tests indicate that our method not only reliably captures this evolution over time, but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art temporal embedding approaches on both semantic accuracy and alignment quality.","inCitations":["94e3911f72dfe27ed2e73bbb797b2273fbbf085b","a41cf8154a64fe95f9c362e5664aebb02b18ee85","c59a8dc63cfe09b80c380b058af5eba3e1482668","24e857e3213b2346f574fdf10ca607cb6bb37efb","e0e25bd4ea361557c3a9cb7e3c2ba992a8a38dd3","05b1510aa53f99b02ae354f81726bcfbd8f186bb","46a33394da26e868b34bee501e900289c5daac3c","5f4743aba8f02bf8bdcc8c263332b1d5d1c9a616","d63763f18bbc55d8d2e74e8addf2bc55d3c8268f"],"pmid":"","title":"Dynamic Word Embeddings for Evolving Semantic Discovery","journalPages":"673-681","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159703","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00607v2.pdf"],"entities":["Coordinate descent","Feature learning","Machine learning","Mathematical optimization","Optimization problem","Scalability","Statistical model","Text corpus","The New York Times","Vocabulary","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","0d635696ef2c768095d9f6378df93241a0e78d16","5c431acc0a3f56660e9275248a3b549feb79c06f","27211ed68a7a00f1df0121fa1890a1b2acdd1a88","5b602ffe4ee5676470aaeb437af7f68ba5f7ef73","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","3ae4e53bcaa8f949184dfd6118a85c79c01053e7","6c28fa958493007595780be3163a04247c8fa81c","6aa3d8bcca2ebdc52ef7cd786204c338f9d609f2","003055c1e7108975f88042f20321add41a7bdee5","72e3a8a3aa8355e1cf6862f1181ed309682f659a","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","1944fda0d2aad86fdfac5f3c0d5c3b4055fa1336","3cfbb77e5a0e24772cfdb2eb3d4f35dead54b118","0eef0dcf7daa1df2eddb4b6f1947827f5a289132","89d4a6b1cbbbbb64f384216ebfe763788a8730c4","7f8abf25ca24b48450b4e535f41e2b8a87df73f5","2d2ff73b66d36093abcaa249ab278e819f5b6f01","1a07186bc10592f0330655519ad91652125cd907","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","5a99baacab4270decdb093f0487c2ef374a259ef","2f7a988d4521be4462cddd3f693c87712c692f2c","196fb01195fdd663da829bbe2532dad4f526042b","2f8d3cad81006ef7174c1c3161e31aa7eefd99a5","728bbc615aececb184b07899d973fad62269dc21","89b5515dbce0e8339e50da8f9b779657ddb01100","714958f525fd285856dad01a87c88e529f53e453","1b255cda9c92a5fbaba319aeb4b4ec532693c2a4","2e2abcd603f247ee635713b1c0e0bcedd63a2e85","0d595499be7192d532798e7028480a3e9fbd0829","19e8aaa1021f829c8ff0378158d9b69699ea4f83","33dddd704ac52237e1bd019648b39a78117d759b"],"id":"ffa952b637e03bcae13b38e13ce5cf73c6f24e59","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ffa952b637e03bcae13b38e13ce5cf73c6f24e59","authors":[{"name":"Zijun Yao","ids":["40009020"]},{"name":"Yifan Sun","ids":["2213925"]},{"name":"Weicong Ding","ids":["2365722"]},{"name":"Nikhil Rao","ids":["40543851"]},{"name":"Hui Xiong","ids":["1707713"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159703"}

Experimenting with CiteSeerX dataset, our program produced a diverse list of 10 citation contexts that could be recommended to users. We evaluated the experiment results based on a user case study of 15 articles.

We found that (i) people of higher socioeconomic status, active to a greater degree during the daytime, use a more standard language; (ii) the southern part of the country is more prone to use more standard language than the northern one, while locally the used variety or dialect is determined by the spatial distribution of socioeconomic status; and (iii) individuals connected in the social network are closer linguistically than disconnected ones, even after the effects of status homophily have been removed.

In this paper, we formalize this group anomaly detection issue, and propose a novel non-parametric bayesian model, named Multi-view Group Anomaly Detection (MGAD). By representing the multi-view data with different latent group and topic structures, MGAD first discovers the distribution of groups or topics in each view, then detects group anomalies effectively. In order to solve the proposed model, we conduct the collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for model inference. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and real-world datasets with different anomaly settings. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on detecting multi-view group anomalies.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Multi-View Group Anomaly Detection","journalPages":"277-286","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271770"],"entities":["Algorithm","Anomaly detection","Bayesian network","Cross entropy","Experiment","Gibbs sampling","Sampling (signal processing)","Sensor","Synthetic intelligence"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["dccdcb2b7f8dd002f9f521fa0c306ccc9ff66ec6","6cea69c3ad2b4b7f8cff177764c14648f6f077cd","332162f79ec80ee092ab122f8aee9370bc3719d4","b9eac16af380ee4f08e5c782d84478b87ef6bd42","6e6c4f452380cb1d21b08fd5db06b077807c5840","652f540f788d06205482bc1008852c853483d8fa","29936111122f09b97e0736ebb6a03d1ad3f5fa92","741abfcb621d9aa19aa79e4aa5c5cddb1473b3da","aaba1fb7ca5dd562f6e3968e22c3e1214c2f9aef","38f3d1508dca07e659d8aa28d895ae51881e5c53","3a9474805067588fb8caf0c8d9c1db907d162a55","6953ed6844c5901742df4efccd745c2f8e652225","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","06d4572892665fc1522253df634a237012cd79c8","22da4cbfa4e29da9a43996324c318dd33b947b48","07486a6e01a64634ece368eea7820bcd862f4d15","1d8a1baa939e516545eb74d4308b312d4845977f","296c57a375ac07ad122cf3c7296372cbc708ca92","42ab0e4f12dc49ec82d267cafcb1a11b161bd1fc","638975fc415cfcec60f3f1a7217ca61c00a321f0","85e062551740337581edab5fd6060322d566085d","04d3e9c0b08d7d3fe5a59d7012aec884fdd93286","9a7895f1eab2de729a8a5333ee78eecde7c9ff50","c5e663d0e37ec5abc3d7cac63321ac5f0079cd66","cb9355d11aabfac2eac54a7a38219a006a7548b7","655ee1b3bb5b7b816ba8aed773ef65e83bf701d1"],"id":"f5d6d16349324326ff6fb536086fc6c5a29f6c19","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f5d6d16349324326ff6fb536086fc6c5a29f6c19","authors":[{"name":"Hongtao Wang","ids":["1729957"]},{"name":"Pan Su","ids":["40538901"]},{"name":"Miao Zhao","ids":["48886436"]},{"name":"Hongmei Wang","ids":["1701164"]},{"name":"Gang Li","ids":["1727716"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271770"}

In particular, network alignment, or the task of identifying corresponding nodes in different networks, has applications across the social and natural sciences. Motivated by recent advancements in node representation learning for single-graph tasks, we propose REGAL (REpresentation learning-based Graph ALignment), a framework that leverages the power of automatically-learned node representations to match nodes across different graphs. Within REGAL we devise xNetMF, an elegant and principled node embedding formulation that uniquely generalizes to multi-network problems. Our results demonstrate the utility and promise of unsupervised representation learning-based network alignment in terms of both speed and accuracy. REGAL runs up to 30x faster in the representation learning stage than comparable methods, outperforms existing network alignment methods by 20 to 30% accuracy on average, and scales to networks with millions of nodes each.","inCitations":["bd5c1a7a993bf3cfd9cdb1f04a6ee9d241fcbc00","6844c0a451997df0fa61b969f8409f4be9309d4c","6c2c468054c0627fb5d02f57e79f73cd13a4dc17"],"pmid":"","title":"REGAL: Representation Learning-based Graph Alignment.","journalPages":"117-126","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271788","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06257v3.pdf"],"entities":["Analysis of algorithms","Apollonian network","Authorization","Co-occurrence matrix","Database normalization","Document-term matrix","Emoticon","Feature learning","Image scaling","Internet Information Services","Loss function","Low-rank approximation","Machine learning","N-gram","Optimization problem","Sampling (signal processing)","Sigmoid function","Similarity measure","Social network analysis","Unsupervised learning","Weighted network","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["da7ee47ee1ccee8080f5827c3c8ee60af90e5fa0","2891da32932a45f8b14bb95f7e26b5ae9677f430","4657c06d57cea792eab4f14e3a12f50d88109680","624edd78551ddfd0a2f17e46b51556f8906bda4f","3c82268f64e9ef2731ad5272366b500a055ed610","52e17f46bf81af81e3fb744a8e0058cb4bd2e22e","404ae4a2b31d5c2184861cf702f953e47db40cab","8918d1a8d6595e105eef277c401a9680c9643277","194c2eec28f70ac7da28c7d9f73f65351a181df2","283fc53cbf90df0eed7e8fbc5425375700f6614c","8c81ddd9c1a6f0d44851c0d2f7f6c4d28ba38382","34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","f5f48abc2ed25bc560913ad31285bec8862873c3","23daca4fc12c49af4c427acb529b00bafee809f5","4410f0c48f982f960a54500df7bd88e4cab88927","dcd8ecd97cb734fc76cc5819e2f63ebe989a28db","199369d8eaff23e00c106ef2ddc4181696600c1f","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","5edc36f9549284f15bc9cb9430b8f01bb4e9f5b3","e63b8a014084ad836f880f1deddaa4954a2c80ff","ca2bfcf88873cce70e92b160bf0b6a2472c2fee7","0686b17e6b9e04e767a7ab7874627c8dd1601bf6","a8183dd20d36fa08ab88ac2ee905ca94f041f7e1","8034bff4fe646e003148d78c129385d7f8a42eb6","440819897d051bdb57182fd2a61777c7a8b710b7","14e77d56cf29fad96b3caefe4a4057782fa496e4","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","082efb23b9bd1c0b447614807b59222f474d91bd","2e37d6b9a02ec31ea22252c37beae410c6b609a8","908272f8e6340971600148d4e73f50e1e8843aaf","1070ede2b5ad3972dfbfceb751aca28a3480bb9a","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","5ac20145c5d662320cdc55acd185626defe03c7d","7ee3a70c5400e64778271ac508a0611ac7d4bcf1","24489085f90aa5d262c21ef66c33dabaf413667e","8fdd71b6af75e71d4bcca20eb3defc6ce4424237","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","ada33b43df07107147899fdfdfd6a7ba09691dd6","d0b7c8828f0fca4dd901674e8fb5bd464a187664","def5589c5d064f80cccb804fad06b7768b1347ea"],"id":"e16d5f801dfb56fa69e5b4927aa451c49007a712","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e16d5f801dfb56fa69e5b4927aa451c49007a712","authors":[{"name":"Mark Heimann","ids":["35505461"]},{"name":"Haoming Shen","ids":["10777659"]},{"name":"Tara Safavi","ids":["8495818"]},{"name":"Danai Koutra","ids":["2479152"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271788"}

Several recent works induce rules or calculate statistics on these KBs. Most of these methods are based on the assumption that the data is a representative sample of the studied universe. Unfortunately, KBs are biased because they are built from crowdsourcing and opportunistic agglomeration of available databases. This paper aims at approximating the representativeness of a relation within a knowledge base. For this, we use the generalized Benford\u2019s law, which indicates the distribution expected by the facts of a relation. We then compute the minimum number of facts that have to be added in order to make the KB representative of the real world. Experiments show that our unsupervised method applies to a large number of relations.

First, unlike traditional TV broadcasts, content is now streamed over the Internet enabling it to reach a wider audience. Second, due to various user-generated content platforms it has become possible for anyone to get involved, streaming their own content to the world. This emerging trend of going live usually happens via social platforms, where users perform live social broadcasts predominantly from their mobile devices, allowing their friends (and the general public) to engage with the stream in real-time. With the growing popularity of such platforms, the burden on the current Internet infrastructure is therefore expected to multiply. With this in mind, we explore one such prominent platform \u2014 Facebook Live. We gather 3TB of data, representing one month of global activity and explore the characteristics of live social broadcast. From this, we derive simple yet effective principles which can decrease the network burden. We then dissect global and hyper-local properties of the video while on-air, by capturing the geography of the broadcasters or the users who produce the video and the viewers or the users who interact with it. Finally, we study the social engagement while the video is live and distinguish the key aspects when the same video goes on-demand. A common theme throughout the paper is that, despite its name, many attributes of Facebook Live deviate from both the concepts of live and broadcast.","inCitations":["3a759d7a92406cb56ce1f665dcffc665b5d2ef50"],"pmid":"","title":"Facebook (A)Live?: Are Live Social Broadcasts Really Broadcasts?","journalPages":"1491-1500","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed0e/3a5f527d6e1c3c9d05923668553eef67a837.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/36805/Tyson%20Facebook%20(A)Live%202018%20Published.pdf?sequence=1","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02791v1.pdf","http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~tysong/files/WWW18.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186061","https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/nishanth.sastry/pubs/www2018-FB-Live.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02791"],"entities":["Align (company)","Archive","Byte","Edge computing","Exception handling","Internet","Locality of reference","Mobile device","Real-time transcription","Social graph","Streaming media","Terabyte","Upload","User-generated content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["46849777c177f639e9d3fa13052f9c099bb40424","eac4a3c312044966655d8f8b34a4505d45a43968","a816600d3b6af67258f8dfdd1bd756eff579ea9f","4121a4b0e65ba46a1ae71fac8cbcac3da8fa9bc0","2702bec6bd24fbbccbddc86d31e0ce274c9e255a","903a8db7bac7a2826cd98ae5425d839852274f7d","43cc2a3c3500ab42a506454b7ab8e9b7839a96ec","89283ee665da63ec9cf87e4008ead3e8963fa02b","00263a4c9942b851bc6f5cab335b23ecf54440ad","3f9de4bcfdf91824711ed93b31be1da382adb55b","a8de1a314a4c7fba0311f8d7f313bac47051caa3","82bf7628f83a0c14093a9b994d7c94153d3ea224","06af8d6d2b812ed2f93b682b365f8ad793bb96cd","19fe729e7aa7600e75113bd9a0441b6fbdd5a149","c7ab5c0886f8a9b3570d215ab981c63c77433f1f","56f4733d388c9dfec28ef3d7f31cb6926f1c3ba9","76f0dfe29bbb418c01d5847dffc8e77d3f2dc168","6b0d2502f41a3086915fc8c2dbf523afbf04fb72","1e5a073f99a9db9994143319df74633c702146dc","f5128a11939134d98c413e362b9691ba5a295f01","d1274741231257a25f83d526b229de1389f29b10","025293699fbf4756796f890cc3359dccedfe18ad","5c45f161458264b0a4a39e4131c03afe30b659fb","19025f8942e3fa76e2158cb3a76997a5116f0303","4b19d28f36fecfd2ff490ef99cce190b9f5911a0","4dedd0d84392d0969e2f0743e3adc5334499aa70","d8221bd3916bc6c254ab1cf84f56c2b92ce453d9","b1f6e151f44d2b5feec8b6a66caa253c674e7ba5","cd8e7f5155c0282c0603f643d033ba22636d3cc2","615fe45ab84a24d432f023394a8db3d03bb6006a","d3049fec97b2319f7feff72c4bd10d41d604072c","11c023a94853dc4e37ffbd97382cd0d0fb5cf3f8"],"id":"2585e854d888b26d4c7cfe33d53be9285fb26302","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2585e854d888b26d4c7cfe33d53be9285fb26302","authors":[{"name":"Aravindh Raman","ids":["37594946"]},{"name":"Gareth Tyson","ids":["1749012"]},{"name":"Nishanth R.

In practice, the number of labels are very large and organized in form of a tree. It is non-trivial to describe the issue completely and attach appropriate labels unless one knows the cause of the problem and the related labels. Sometimes domain experts discuss the issue with the users and change the ticket labels accordingly, without modifying the ticket description. This results in inconsistent and badly labeled data, making it hard for supervised algorithms to learn from. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of creating a conversational helpdesk system, which will ask relevant questions to the user, for identification of the right category and will then raise a ticket on users' behalf. We use attention based seq2seq model to assign the hierarchical categories to tickets. We use a slot filling model to help us decide what questions to ask to the user, if the top-k model predictions are not consistent. We also present a novel approach to generate training data for the slot filling model automatically based on attention in the hierarchical classification model. We demonstrate via a simulated user that the proposed approach can give us a significant gain in accuracy on ticket-data without asking too many questions to users. Finally, we also show that our seq2seq model is as versatile as other approaches on publicly available datasets, as state of the art approaches.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Automatic Conversational Helpdesk Solution using Seq2Seq and Slot-filling Models","journalPages":"1967-1975","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272029"],"entities":["Algorithm","Class hierarchy","Routing","Subject-matter expert","Supervised learning","Tree (data structure)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["23354987095a8a9a283ce4c9a690522d6b11e2dd","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","b75b59f38c874a920102834c9e218c960fc35c81","9e3d12a20e3e6e76fec282c3a12f9cff6f8f2810","2c18d75509e58cdd3069f55662bbde04dfc5a839","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","9dfacffdae4527d01563814c804e410e4ca885e1","27c29dfd66178cd50b0b51e2bb34ebd46113641a","c9018c51ae4fda53164e02093330d8dc788f7842","942a0e834a9bbd4edc44fc90de1713197ee28e06","07a5c4ba84268708146aa4bf5cad9491b3e35051","bf2a1aa6306b35c69c9f435e4eadb97c98c38b9a","17f5c7411eeeeedf25b0db99a9130aa353aee4ba","0755a662980ace717dae76a1ce6ad2c138dd63d1","524196b06b016578dc5200ed148080ef426dca4c","378f2f9a15dd9a0509c1b0c80bad18d3c4727c2f","1ddba1eeb6aa556adfbceac37742d354d084e4c2","84af7277cf4b7bf96d5bb0774b92b247327ed71d","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","7c88a0f765ce3c9025345cf133251cb947fe6ee5","5dd61f963188c7be383f851b2bb53b74429a662d","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","a9eeb17b9cdb9f83f2e55ee5783a317fccc40e2f","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","2d2a9e7ae7169e91f42fb2b3e8901c2d0bee8244","1b1df9f75ee6f27433687dad302387f811dab64d","c17834a49b059a22275e22ca02d5ed273d15cd12","6a473e9e0a2183928b2d78bddf4b3d01ff46c454","094d9601e6f6c45579647e20b5f7b0eeb4e2819f","9b4bcecf5134d70b8ff6036b9cfe57a3ff74bbd8","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e"],"id":"b057d645bef6ab000a6f708e1b4e452437b02b82","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b057d645bef6ab000a6f708e1b4e452437b02b82","authors":[{"name":"Mayur Patidar","ids":["34823900"]},{"name":"Puneet Agarwal","ids":["4431988"]},{"name":"Lovekesh Vig","ids":["3213990"]},{"name":"Gautam Shroff","ids":["2393804"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3272029"}

These networks, where every node is associated with a type of action and a frequency, are usually referred to as activity networks. Examples of such networks include road networks, where the nodes are intersections and the edges are road segments. Each node is associated with a number of geolocated actions that users of an online platform took in its vicinity. In these networks, we define a prize-collecting subgraph to be a connected set of nodes, which exhibits high levels of activity, and is compact, i.e., the nodes are close to each other. The k-PCSubgraphs problem we address in this paper is defined as follows: given an activity network and an integer k , identify k non-overlapping and connected subgraphs of the network such that the nodes of each subgraph are close to each other, and the total number of actions they are associated with is high. Here, we define and study two new variants of the k-PCSubgraphs problem, where the subgraphs of interest are tours and paths. Since both these problems are NP-hard, we provide approximate and heuristic algorithms that run in time nearly-linear to the number of edges. In our experiments, we use real activity networks obtained by combining road networks and projecting on them user activity from Twitter and Flickr. Our experimental results demonstrate both the efficiency and the practical utility of our methods.

It trains a classifier using seed words of categories, rather than labeled documents that are expensive to obtain. However, a small set of seed words may provide very limited and noisy supervision information, because many documents contain no seed words or only irrelevant seed words. In this paper, we address these issues using document manifold, assuming that neighboring documents tend to be assigned to a same category label. Following this idea, we propose a novel Laplacian seed word topic model (LapSWTM). In LapSWTM, we model each document as a mixture of hidden category topics, each of which corresponds to a distinctive category. Also, we assume that neighboring documents tend to have similar category topic distributions. This is achieved by incorporating a manifold regularizer into the log-likelihood function of the model, and then maximizing this regularized objective. Experimental results show that our LapSWTM significantly outperforms the existing dataless text classification algorithms and is even competitive with supervised algorithms to some extent. More importantly, it performs extremely well when the seed words are scarce.","inCitations":["31ccc53c9344f922d93951a279f0511bb4b18e1a"],"pmid":"","title":"Dataless Text Classification: A Topic Modeling Approach with Document Manifold","journalPages":"973-982","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271671"],"entities":["Document classification","Expectation\u2013maximization algorithm","Experiment","Manifold regularization","Relevance","Seed","Topic model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["947946b2444cf6e9432e25013c516c37f5031dda","6ed19e520d98cedc8df788aec074795fb78e6e02","3d890a2ec766f9ec146285ababde8d92ee6a099f","c757be6651bebee423a82554418bef55d9a54c7f","85d3cd92c3f6ebf570ede116710afb97523521e4","505bf56dcd0b8884b6127a2c5c43206f4bc87f3d","eac64ccceba24649b4acd8b56cafee6e66f84bb7","31ccc53c9344f922d93951a279f0511bb4b18e1a","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","560d47ebf7ebbd63e535256e443f83b6643ef047","241193b8edc93b1b3292467cbf661e23c051f8fd","32496087fa004299f7dab5dc0732d7e0509dfbd1","280c4cdea3356be5340ac0082a031137e88fd168","0f7f1b3b7b8660ca2cb04a8890ae921326fd0edb","2a27d4c259331ccbb909cddeb9f9a9149dbb3912","d0d4ed0145ca5122510c637fce58329b1b133283","0b46c972cd5d84359aa4dde6b722bb89c151a6a2","45c8591533ee33e154167401d4f2e7331b82ada5","454b4ca144a218a9ce6e7d1e5110b3abaa3a409a","f653d20d23ad412e559fc6771f772f589395e5ef"],"id":"877d81886b57db2980bd87a0527508232f1f2a24","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/877d81886b57db2980bd87a0527508232f1f2a24","authors":[{"name":"Ximing Li","ids":["3217303"]},{"name":"Changchun Li","ids":["48162071"]},{"name":"Jinjin Chi","ids":["7518250"]},{"name":"Jihong OuYang","ids":["3313180"]},{"name":"Chenliang Li","ids":["2829009"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271671"}

People rely heavily on mobile devices for searching online, sending emails, chatting with friends, etc. As a result, input efficiency becomes increasingly important for real-time communication on mobile devices. Due to the small size of the screen on mobile devices, however, it is oftentimes frustrating for users to correct or update the input sequences on an even smaller input area on the screen. This often causes poor user experience. In this paper, we focus on improving the input efficiency on mobile devices to offer better user experience. In order to achieve efficient input, there are multiple challenges: 1) how to employ a single, unified representation of the keyboard layouts for different input languages; 2) how to build a framework to correct a mistouch immediately and predict the coming input texts (words or phrases) effectively; 3) how to deploy and evaluate the model on mobile devices with limited computational power. To address these challenges, we introduce \\em FastInput to improve the user input efficiency on mobile devices. Three key techniques are developed in FastInput -- layout modeling, instant mistouch correction and user input text prediction. We also design solutions for efficient deployment and evaluation of FastInput on mobile devices. The proposed FastInput achieves higher efficiency compared to the traditional input system over millions of user input sequences in different languages.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"FastInput: Improving Input Efficiency on Mobile Devices","journalPages":"2057-2065","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272006"],"entities":["Email","Mobile device","Plover","Real-time clock","Smartphone","Software deployment","User experience"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["427b168f490b56716f22b129ac93aba5425ea08f","aea70faf2bb66df07ba35ae84aa289f1fc7b1c50","26dcbd9c52344185c94a25590092e7ea9e71c9f1","032274e57f7d8b456bd255fe76b909b2c1d7458e","0ce242296fc6e7214b4b95214c9a5695260911a8","7e688b260483badfed211273b7da2a4bfea290cd","7af09246bae1d2d9abada79f441ba25858c69ef9","01c1795d00e1ad4a69c5dd3498a38715ca898833","6d85dda87a18d6b5a5a1bdd3019cb31396aaa7c9","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","668db48c6a79826456341680ee1175dfc4cced71","28703eef8fe505e8bd592ced3ce52a597097b031","ebc9e751e3056a17f1d40a146fa39bb82ded6c8a","06d51deada6e771a2571807a47dd991120c8dd1a","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","d263137e6d4fbc7065f2f9b453a04110d08fd726","4fc6da3829b6b881e3d7d4ac029fb121bf257003","2599131a4bc2fa957338732a37c744cfe3e17b24","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","17accbdd4aa3f9fad6af322bc3d7f4d5b648d9cd","096d7d2e9b3fbc37f1c4e75b1896ae3797950ef9","2fd9f4d331d144f71baf2c66628b12c8c65d3ffb","1d81f37488a6c492d5dd2733d485c9b014e9eeb4","1d106a2730801b6210a67f7622e4d192bb309303","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","348a5ce76222582849fa67fdad196bcc8ea96a62","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","48886ea4ee14f0151f186207e1b9ad1d947e83ef","c8523bba348d00b65c516518281a35837509d617","383da63501241b196167340a3f1e141012715ebd","c7788fe99735eceff2bcc37401fc02d2825f739a","41b2068f134adf9afb3dae2d8811e2d21f471e3d","11540131eae85b2e11d53df7f1360eeb6476e7f4","2d56cf126ad0d2ce86dbce566caca3da4c0e371e"],"id":"8d181a554756aa39e15355d26f2a03981e8121d4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d181a554756aa39e15355d26f2a03981e8121d4","authors":[{"name":"Jingyuan Zhang","ids":["1899371"]},{"name":"Xin Wang","ids":["48631993"]},{"name":"Yue Feng","ids":["49771398"]},{"name":"Mingming Sun","ids":["2473874"]},{"name":"Ping Li","ids":["50492776"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3272006"}

Owing to the growing strategic importance of these brand key assets, this paper presents a novel feature extraction method named Multi-modal Asset-aware Projection (M2A2P) to learn a discriminative subspace from the high-dimensional multi-modal social media data for effective brand key asset discovery. By formulating a new asset-aware discriminative information preserving criterion, M2A2P differentiates with the existing multi-model feature extraction algorithms in two pivotal aspects: 1) We consider brand's highly imbalanced class interest steering towards the KOLs and PCs over the irrelevant users; 2) We consider a common observation that a user is not exclusive to a single class (e.g. a KOL can also be a PC).

Different from other systems, CoNEREL processes articles and comments in batch mode, to make the best use of the shared contexts of multiple news stories and their comments. Particularly, a news article provides context for all its comments. To improve named entity recognition, CoNEREL utilizes co-reference of mentions to refine their class labels ( e.g. , person, location). To link the recognized entities to Wikipedia, our system implements Pair-Linking, a state-of-the-art entity linking algorithm. Furthermore, CoNEREL provides an interactive visualization of the Pair-Linking process. From the visualization, one can understand how Pair-Linking achieves decent linking performance through iterative evidence building, while being extremely fast and efficient.

However, collaborative filtering usually suffers from limited performance due to the sparsity of user-item interaction. To address this issue, auxiliary information is usually used to improve the performance. Transfer learning provides the key idea of using knowledge from auxiliary domains. An assumption of transfer learning in collaborative filtering is that the source domain is a full rating matrix, which may not hold in many real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage rating patterns from multiple incomplete source domains to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the transferred learning, we compress the knowledge from the source domain into a cluster-level rating matrix. The rating patterns in the low-level matrix can be transferred to the target domain. Specifically, we design a knowledge extraction method to enrich rating patterns by relaxing the full rating restriction on the source domain. Finally, we propose a robust multiple-rating-pattern transfer learning model for cross-domain collaborative filtering, which is called MINDTL, to accurately predict missing values in the target domain. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective and outperforms several alternative methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Robust Transfer Learning for Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering Using Multiple Rating Patterns Approximation","journalPages":"225-233","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159675"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Baseline (configuration management)","Collaborative filtering","Experiment","High- and low-level","Missing data","Recommender system","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e5d49e31d67fe90a5204f688904530c5f6fd12e4","60de8fd9bf01c29f0e3b8b48339e388d7c39b1dc","32f01f0132d456bd271296281b3e1380db39389e","a67429474820bd56c30bc36618ed43fba3908bbe","1e1d1c9a3cc9991bf64b075be899bff7440f895a","b9b7aeaf6cdf6ed9686bacd1ab968419a9cbe44f","d04247b3383acac840bce7c85f29d65b51771904","46a5b381bf814f52d1a7fe4a0d29cf5219cfa9d7","71012dc01f2b39705c0a1cacfe81af056553ae70","c188b6549d5995251eac37663e3fc7de19fccbc6","af229f71430f5184de0817b02776acbdf53fb754","ef5ebe77dd0694c6fda09933599715e2c745aa8d","2878d0e411da2c93e13fc27f44a021a922f80212","659d86b70e3a82c0277e4b410860312fd27d3c91","8a634a82681897822b14de28849c6548346206a0","d5a55a548fc7cd703c1dd8d867ca1eb6b0c0764c","dd8d51622a2fbcaabed888cf5f4f41541e99a996","5a85e9ee21026295b370a042d59dbeb261b66088","b24a4404a7921ff197fe480a20bdb0f01cb426db","87ce789dbddfebd296993597d72e1950b846e99f","b0168228f333deb2bd1bb08979252956070dbbda","61eef6fa3f8adfb253bb645ae411fe49f6a92f60","96544d4857777682129280b9d934d6ff2f221f40","1112824e529592696970d55350cab67f317605be","42c0858f86f2b602335d189bd537c0b6e3505c05","2c576ca80b943db9e74c34d5ae9693845543f191","6c42c4d33aca10d0c3d9b51a153ed8738e109123","84ad75dd2bb8aef4b70c5f7db6ff947767c30264","f4de6ab26169c439fc2742d5f2778baae06c239a","13c02cbc58472db0e35a32de08ee06d79adc9215","9fea905a187c4c4dbaa0fe9ed79c871fd398f955","172885e510800e8943d707f7dedcc31a5d73be27"],"id":"17dc389165201032e9a375bd7dec8032dea5747d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/17dc389165201032e9a375bd7dec8032dea5747d","authors":[{"name":"Ming He","ids":["1724986"]},{"name":"Jiuling Zhang","ids":["3344004"]},{"name":"Peng Yang","ids":["1683829"]},{"name":"Kaisheng Yao","ids":["39922478"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159675"}

With an adversarial training mechanism, GAN manages to train a generative model to fit the underlying unknown real data distribution under the guidance of the discriminative model estimating whether a data instance is real or generated. Such a framework is originally proposed for fitting continuous data distribution such as images, thus it is not straightforward to be directly applied to information retrieval scenarios where the data is mostly discrete, such as IDs, text and graphs. In this tutorial, we focus on discussing the GAN techniques and the variants on discrete data fitting in various information retrieval scenarios.

However, such activities are often covert and embedded across multiple domains and contexts. They are generally not detectable and recognizable from the perspective of an isolated network, and only become apparent when multiple networks are analyzed in a joint manner. Thus, one of the main research topics in modeling adversarial activities is to develop effective techniques to align and fuse information from different networks into a unified representation for global analysis. Based on the combined network representation, an equally important research topic is on detecting and matching indicating patterns to recognize the underlining adversarial activities in the integrated network. The focus of this workshop is to gather together the researchers from all relevant fields to share their experience and opinions on graph mining techniques in the era of big data, with emphasis on two fundamental problems - \"Connecting the dots\" and \"finding a needle in a haystack\", in the context of graph-based adversarial activity analytics.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"GTA 3 2018: Workshop on Graph Techniques for Adversarial Activity Analytics","journalPages":"803","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3160595"],"entities":["Adversary (cryptography)","Align (company)","Big data","Embedded system","Sensor","Structure mining"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"00338c468b9f81b6e0394a889d475d73f2189129","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/00338c468b9f81b6e0394a889d475d73f2189129","authors":[{"name":"Jiejun Xu","ids":["1684988"]},{"name":"Hanghang Tong","ids":["8163721"]},{"name":"Tsai-Ching Lu","ids":["1692592"]},{"name":"Jingrui He","ids":["37395525"]},{"name":"Nadya Bliss","ids":["14914381"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3160595"}

The length of constructed v-grams is not limited by any bound and exceeds 100 characters in provided experiments. Constructed v-grams can be used for any sequential data analysis and allows transfer bag-of-word techniques to non-text data types. The method demonstrates a high compression rate on various real-life datasets.

However, recommendation for newly launched social media sites is challenging because they often lack user historical data and encounter data sparsity and cold-start problem. Thus, it is important to exploit auxiliary information to help improve recommendation performances on these sites. Existing approaches try to utilize the knowledge transferred from other mature sites, which often require overlapped users or similar items to ensure an effective knowledge transfer. However, these assumptions may not hold in practice because 1) Overlapped user set is often unavailable and costly to identify due to the heterogeneous user profile, content and network data, and 2) Different schemes to show item attributes across sites cause the attribute values inconsistent, incomplete, and noisy. Thus, how to transfer knowledge when no direct bridge is given between two social media sites remains a challenge. In addition, another auxiliary information we can exploit is the mutual benefit between social relationships and rating preferences within the platform. User-user relationships are widely used as side information to improve item recommendation, whereas how to exploit user-item interactions for friend recommendation is rather limited. To tackle these challenges, we propose aCross media jointF riend andI temRe commendation framework (CrossFire ), which can capture both 1) cross-platform knowledge transfer, and 2) within-platform correlations among user-user relations and user-item interactions. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","inCitations":["1b8feab8365b1d3210fa6b980bd3756b677e4ae8","fb698241a9a6dec0ddd3e0bf85485ee0e31cbb6a","a6062f4adffa2e8a380c8c45a6ee27e638c61192","0bd648d4b0b23196330b9ab4913e22cecf764de9","ee0fd8f00b3a2cb2505045214cf730704aa3142c"],"pmid":"","title":"CrossFire: Cross Media Joint Friend and Item Recommendations","journalPages":"522-530","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159692","http://www.public.asu.edu/~skai2/papers/wsdmf325-shuA.pdf","http://www.public.asu.edu/~skai2/files/wsdm18_poster_kai.pdf","http://www.public.asu.edu/~skai2/files/wsdm18_slides_kai.pdf"],"entities":["Cold start","Interaction","Performance","Recommender system","Social media","Sparse matrix","User profile"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3581ff32946ed9ed07be8e307bffd57d3b8d995e","10e1fb949e10d5fe99d5f1b32bb48d625149bce8","ad49936242755a6fdb8b75ce28c8ed6e66c3f31b","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","a98014f32fd66a55bd2c851694718a656eed35a4","4cc352fa9dc7fc87389ce95e6779a2603f4ee87f","d5a55a548fc7cd703c1dd8d867ca1eb6b0c0764c","2ab4eac4ffc63bdfb4f280136d72d33b181b8ab5","738a3161cec73894d51dac059fa431173f33e02e","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20","122d19f2435cee094b7aaa84c8bb13a8978ddf21","27160012f226c0294579036668881c069f01b6ec","4eb130a05b2fc9cad0bd97fd85500a71ad5cbd66","4210f095629a1488aebd224d585ebc0af9261d59","c1ced85995eaa0d904e25c77b6919b66f168be64","5d76202ebe37936b4c3796d9cbbe7be5b60f93d0","18cac5d010d7a1cf684e9f2bf177843fb8cd1893","37b1ea5fb0ff024b6b49c43843efd77603390836","94a62f470aeea69af436e2dd0b54cd50eaaa4b23","3eccaa29623bbc5fa90a2de63c8f098c9802aeaa","41245aa31780116ae14cab0290841070779bf4a5","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","01dd5af05830e96211e5445b65c96abccf8d0445","058ada9d78c689e03ea898008e2bcebf69910d4f","3e8509ad80f880cb76a1d1673abfdd54eb16cc35","38e024c97f0e55097919066b7233a5caa622a62f","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8","32f01f0132d456bd271296281b3e1380db39389e","eb69c0e29ab2c2187ea850ff23b9a66d222375ed","4568c5d17f9f770c0c11ac5ea3f92cfdd25cfe21","aad9c378dc1485957ae8d661596462b2ec16ab24","049c5adce7a475f5b825ee0c2ef940958d32b27d","2744288f090192987e980274999065ad2d6e45d6"],"id":"cce60519321884c2722f590c459f92551915563e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cce60519321884c2722f590c459f92551915563e","authors":[{"name":"Kai Shu","ids":["2406754"]},{"name":"Suhang Wang","ids":["2893721"]},{"name":"Jiliang Tang","ids":["1736632"]},{"name":"Yilin Wang","ids":["46395101"]},{"name":"Huan Liu","ids":["38746648"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159692"}

Many initiatives are currently promoting the idea of having free and open citation data. Creation of citation data, however, is not part of the cataloging workflow in libraries nowadays. \n In this paper, we present our project Linked Open Citation Database, in which we design distributed processes and a system infrastructure based on linked data technology. The goal is to show that efficiently cataloging citations in libraries using a semi-automatic approach is possible. We specifically describe the current state of the workflow and its implementation. We show that we could significantly improve the automatic reference extraction that is crucial for the subsequent data curation. We further give insights on the curation and linking process and provide evaluation results that not only direct the further development of the project, but also allow us to discuss its overall feasibility.","inCitations":["f2d399a8fb176e7d40a6f02ccb77c496e5d9ee13"],"pmid":"","title":"Linked Open Citation Database: Enabling Libraries to Contribute to an Open and Interconnected Citation Graph","journalPages":"109-118","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3197026.3197050","https://ub-madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/44470/1/jcdl089-lauscherA-1.pdf"],"entities":["Bibliometrics","Citation graph","Data curation","Digital curation","Experiment","Information retrieval","Librarian","Library (computing)","Linked data","Printing","Scientometrics","Semiconductor industry","Tag cloud"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3acb1012ecb8f4680c339764ebf75ce023f29cd4","1eada4718aa6e9ee34ade9d7c284c0b317a6ed94","84073be75980a6a8aabc11a00b4017f681362c08","57f6b4ebf5f6d4a53e52591d5d6bafd4e1664a85","2c8d5fc54717f4e910d1dedea622d1ffbb14333a","9172a6629f3ba411e708465727df56d24d2daf15","8038f8f0d74911d69280e8b1ee8b51822f051e13","7e50c1bcf75641b3d12b65830bb1a431defbd3b7","0a2cf7fe61a37530a4d6da6520c05bb3b6bb9d0e","b9d2dad7914931a5acef2c1529685b4f4a162a14","339eab3747752ba8df289586b7fd0b6d998a31b1","362f50f59a280d7cc526fb626fdf44ad382cee57","56d36c2535c867613997688f649cf0461171dbe8"],"id":"ccca94eba05e1a0f0fcf4a399df0fdef21ebcd03","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ccca94eba05e1a0f0fcf4a399df0fdef21ebcd03","authors":[{"name":"Anne Lauscher","ids":["29891652"]},{"name":"Kai Eckert","ids":["1987324"]},{"name":"Lukas Galke","ids":["11220282"]},{"name":"Ansgar Scherp","ids":["1753135"]},{"name":"Syed Tahseen Raza Rizvi","ids":["40795206"]},{"name":"Sheraz Ahmed","ids":["36898617"]},{"name":"Andreas Dengel","ids":["1703343"]},{"name":"Philipp Zumstein","ids":["35630087"]},{"name":"Annette Klein","ids":["50438468"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3197026.3197050"}

Most neural networks focus on the representation of each sentence, while the common features of a sentence pair are not well studied. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which explicitly models the common features between two sentences for enhancing sentence similarity modeling. To be specific, a common feature extractor is presented and embedded into our CAN model, which includes a generator and a discriminator playing a collaborative and adversarial game for common feature extraction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely TREC-QA and WikiQA for answer selection and MSRP for paraphrase identification, show that our proposed model is effective to boost the performance of sentence similarity modeling. In particular, our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on TREC-QA without using any external resources or pre-training. For the other two datasets, our model is also comparable to if not better than the recent neural network approaches.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"CAN: Enhancing Sentence Similarity Modeling with Collaborative and Adversarial Network","journalPages":"815-824","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210019"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Benchmark (computing)","Computation","Discriminator","Embedded system","Feature extraction","Information retrieval","Knowledge management","Open reading frame","QA & UX Manager","Randomness extractor","Software quality assurance","Supercomputer","Textual entailment","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["06b0e8c067e249a2e71897c00730ec734d18c922","3e393df4a5731fb7b49cf2f527fed1ee4e6e6942","df6a4d0233423252d867e66f8766d02d0e941a55","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","f9970b18d2bdd072f94dbcfe08a2d72e151d3634","85031a4873fe4ddda4a0841b9169b2f164980f3d","528fa9bb03644ba752fb9491be49b9dd1bce1d52","0e5fa90e28fab414c8ef3ac6ca937c6195c2860e","64bb0792e187663e8589bc92a7824e00887febcb","324fc9c732116fa81624faad07524039f193cede","bc34eee11d8ddba18a262a637ea336322c93ba6c","859e3afc4b8e7662a6bf29723863e9d5ca14d14c","6f1b6007638724124e2763f818ee4ebf2da3ae86","03fe39386ce90e10ec87f10e00532c5cf30b244f","0823b293d13a5efaf9c3f37109a4a6018d05d074","ea70aefddcd70b0f63e3588468453790cfc9e598","148c88ef5f96faa76f77b0317a2d8c683a067bdd","346578304ff943b97b3efb1171ecd902cb4f6081","54dd68126a0aa0d5c3a5be15a86d3e423c5fc62c","2f83f6e1afadf0963153974968af6b8342775d82","167abf2c9eda9ce21907fcc188d2e41da37d9f0b","79d16c323cc2584178fbfd2cf4095f2a350fefb4","7988ef10dc9770e5fa4dc40d5d2f3693fd2ed917","107010b7f2abe3c0c9df62bcef35eb77f6fc76df","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","c58738fade559d02a71bedba51bc62d42587777c","8729441d734782c3ed532a7d2d9611b438c0a09a","11399cef77951c6cc7a199c82204f8adeef68541","11ec56898a9e7f401a2affe776b5297bd4e25025","0af737eae02032e66e035dfed7f853ccb095d6f5","1682b8b395c7d7fa30b3cec961ac81fdda53e72d","c6afe8a8aa13de8e3f2710ef07b22ce86a005419","223319a93dcf3912bbc1e5f949e5ab4d53906e62","52956422f86722aca6becb67ea4c3ad61f0c1aea","b130b6387b105ecd9b4718b179b1e128157f9516","35756f711a97166df11202ebe46820a36704ae77","0f6924633c56832b91836b69aedfd024681e427c","6812fb9ef1c2dad497684a9020d8292041a639ff","828dbeb7cf922dc9b6657dd169b8d26d2b58eedb","7acfdc905f734abf966aed58abb983bc015ff7fe","007e86cb55f0ba0415a7764a1e9f9566c1e8784b","6de2b1058c5b717878cce4e7e50d3a372cc4aaa6","4622265755b2d4683e57c32d638bab841a4d5b45","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","0f4de7169787d9922fae06ec80f2d78a7fedda96","50b31cc4a3d7e2742459c272237d8f00a5c92661","68e4aedc69518d8db2f143bd3952668aa41c762c","24b4746688c15c8580d1000d4f4ac63f5eb79561"],"id":"edafa08d896f073f49ed9302a2b843b488143c23","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/edafa08d896f073f49ed9302a2b843b488143c23","authors":[{"name":"Qin Chen","ids":["1858675"]},{"name":"Qinmin Hu","ids":["3330285"]},{"name":"Xiangji Huang","ids":["6743849"]},{"name":"Liang He","ids":["49160085"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210019"}

In an e-commerce se\u008aing, for a newly launched product, persuasive descriptions are o\u0089en composed to motivate an online buyer towards a successful purchase. Such descriptions can be catchy taglines, product-summaries, style-tips etc.. In this paper, we present PersuAIDE! a persuasive system based on linguistic creativity to generate various forms of persuasive sentences from the input product speci\u0080cation. To demonstrate the e\u0082ectiveness of the proposed system, we have applied the technology to fashion domain, where, for a given fashion product like \u201dred collar shirt\u201d we were able to generate descriptive sentences that not only explain the item but also garner positive a\u008aention, making it persuasive. PersuAIDE! identi\u0080es fashion related keywords from input speci\u0080cations and intelligently expands the keywords to creative phrases. Once such compatible phrases are obtained, persuasive descriptions are synthesized from the set of phrases and input keywords with the help of a neural language model trained on a large domainspeci\u0080c fashion corpus. We evaluate the system on a large fashion corpus collected from di\u0082erent sources using (a) automatic text generation metrics used for Machine Translation and Automatic Summarization evaluation and Readability measurement, and (b) human judgment scores evaluating the persuasiveness and \u0083uency of the generated text. Experimental results and qualitative analysis show that an unsupervised system like ours can produce more creative and be\u008aer constructed persuasive output than supervised generative counterparts based on neural sequence-to-sequence models and statistical machine translation.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"PersuAIDE !

As in all scientific endeavors, progress in IIR research is contingent on the ability to build on previous ideas, approaches, and resources. Current trends towards open science and funding mandates to preserve and share research data lend support and even urgency to the notion of establishing a shared disciplinary repository of research tools and data for IIR. The need for an IIR (evaluation) framework was further highlighted by Pia Borlund in her 2016 CHIIR keynote [3]. Components from IIR experiments that could be valuable to archive for re-use include: the systems or platforms used for experimentation, the content or resources of the experimental platform (data collections), the search tasks or work situation, the experimental context and other important aspects of the test design, experimental protocols, questionnaire designs, etc., the gathered user and system interaction data, the tools used for analysis as well as the results and measures. We believe there to be a number of barriers to reproducibility and re-use of resources in IIR research: the fragmentary nature of how the community\u2019s resources are organized, the lack of awareness of their existence, insufficient documentation and organization of the resources, the nature of the typical research publication cycle, and the effort required to make such resources available.

First, we propose a domain-specific intent taxonomy to characterize viewer behavior: as expected, most intents revolve around watching programs---both direct navigation as well as browsing---but there is a non-trivial fraction of non-viewing intents as well. Second, we propose a domain-specific tagging scheme for labeling query tokens, that when combined with intent and program prediction, provides a multi-faceted approach to understand voice queries directed at entertainment systems.","inCitations":["327e62bedfa03cd6e0c7adbf224462dad13dceea"],"pmid":"","title":"What Do Viewers Say to Their TVs?: An Analysis of Voice Queries to Entertainment Systems","journalPages":"1213-1216","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Rao_etal_SIGIR2018.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210140"],"entities":["Direct navigation","Domain-specific language","Faceted classification","Intelligent agent","Interaction","Mobile device","Taxonomy (general)","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["448e1ea75c175b6d8a27be4505c72b4ce6d96b96","36c46dc485b20d4e367bd64b0411146490d7ae9b","e6d408f935668672c64a9584fa614c24e72335a5","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","b836e2f2267bdf8ee6e55f5fa4c82da4cd27747e","6d671e0e26d239bd6a0b8f67d5fc49a76d733f29","fc7ac43bf47c585f1486beb66be6a2c28d5e9197","e014793c1103648b693c4e9efb1129ea96afff49","4529e8010884f969a42ee48b07fafcc533512a6c","19484f95c052e4c67ac73c2c9a06517135ccca79","554d1fc53b04da833f9c1515531bb14f925eb265"],"id":"836ca0698fca9bd9064db242273fd03714782eb8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/836ca0698fca9bd9064db242273fd03714782eb8","authors":[{"name":"Jinfeng Rao","ids":["30586030"]},{"name":"Ferhan Türe","ids":["2851411"]},{"name":"Jimmy Lin","ids":["37752900"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210140"}

Existing work of sign prediction mainly focuses on triangles (triadic nodes) motivated by balance theory to predict positive and negative links. However, real-world signed directed networks can contain a good number of \"bridge'' edges which, by definition, are not included in any triangles. Such edges are ignored in previous work, but may play an important role in signed directed network analysis.%Such edges serve as fundamental building blocks and may play an important role in signed network analysis.\n In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning representations for signed directed networks. We present a novel deep learning approach to incorporating two social-psychologic theories, balance and status theories, to model both triangles and \"bridge'' edges in a complementary manner. The proposed framework learns effective embeddings for nodes and edges which can be applied to diverse tasks such as sign prediction and node ranking. Experimental results on three real-world datasets of signed directed social networks verify the essential role of \"bridge\" edges in signed directed network analysis by achieving the state-of-the-art performance.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"\"Bridge\": Enhanced Signed Directed Network Embedding","journalPages":"773-782","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271738"],"entities":["Ampersand","Balance theory","Deep learning","Distrust","Effective domain","Existential quantification","Experiment","Network theory","Social computing","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["45d84d67870fc5de3b0747d05d9971d750604e7e","9f92972807f1e486a3fae1b75dbc0ab95966807a","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","79068c97c0b111d4eefc0e1d87f706df55c9bfed","3201164a38686a73ff8d4bf41a75bc8739b5f210","a514e1eabb627778dedf00409cc6741cd2e51fe5","11bb373a47e7399d4068f0488ecae22a3dd141b8","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","2be0d0ce3f5729661e19774f4ec9eed8932aab2f","2b8b4c193c5f784fb7c847229c644ce9f8ff47d6","10d3c0a7dd22780562bd76ef9bf4278ca3d4b0b5","05f61ff006f195baaf59eb6b87d3561c6ec8d71a","1001b274f1d7ab16b26a871745b4918999d6d528","4f905a3a2c1bd908d890920b306f858b99587a8a","feee6ea8961398e599577f9f793230d391985b88","91a62654104b681c4b9f19c4e7b9888badaf59dc","2e8cb18e9dc2cec1ef25d08e4567a2840692a5a0","c34336d3bfb7a3c22caa7958779f40bb2ab70a3d","b9d2295a9af8b29aadb197873e6ff06bbdb22958","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","2b98beb92b3fd808571d42d3514ff916a0a17366","64b1767d3b301f886d8c4fc9ce49cf960716f4af","a0da1be7b7665b8c23d80ad2b03815dd708cd7b9","05252b795f0f1238ac7e0d7af7fc2372c34a181d","4236fa2bbf31ca78b482610eceb7a8cd00646962"],"id":"517d194a47440580156ca1fbad2c5f4a822f2d4a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/517d194a47440580156ca1fbad2c5f4a822f2d4a","authors":[{"name":"Yiqi Chen","ids":["50579795"]},{"name":"Tieyun Qian","ids":["34559283"]},{"name":"Huan Liu","ids":["2365866"]},{"name":"Ke Sun","ids":["40271145"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271738"}

Yet, such collaboration is held back by two somewhat conflicting challenges: effective knowledge sharing and limiting leakage of private information. While the censorship of private information is likely to reduce knowledge sharing effectiveness, the generalization of private information to a desired degree can potentially allow, on one hand, to limit the leakage, and on the other hand, to reveal some properties of the private information that can be beneficial for sharing.\n In this demo we present a system that allows knowledge sharing via effective adaptation of fraud detection rules while preserving privacy. The system uses taxonomies to generalize concrete values appearing in fraud detection rules to higher level concepts which conform to some privacy/utility requirements set by the owner. Our demonstration will engage the CIKM'18 audience by showing that private information can be abstracted to enforce privacy while maintaining its usage by (partially) trusted allies.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Preserving Privacy of Fraud Detection Rule Sharing Using Intel's SGX","journalPages":"1935-1938","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269225"],"entities":["Personally identifiable information","Privacy","Requirement","Spectral leakage","Taxonomy (general)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9dfa79cf0734504522afe4e3d37b4d47c4dd3769","c6831d4d9c861f0858de4b11bc98a3bf7eba392d"],"id":"5dcda941cc9a909ca1fa9c77c71dbeb56c82b3ce","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5dcda941cc9a909ca1fa9c77c71dbeb56c82b3ce","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Deutch","ids":["1682639"]},{"name":"Yehonatan Ginzberg","ids":["2762090"]},{"name":"Tova Milo","ids":["1702212"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269225"}

However, existing algorithms for PCA have limited scalability since they explicitly materialize intermediate data, whose size rapidly grows as the dimension increases. To avoid scalability issues, we propose sSketch, a scalable sketching technique for PCA that employs several optimization ideas, such as mean propagation, efficient sparse matrix operations, and effective job consolidation to minimize intermediate data. Using sSketch, we also provide two other scalable methods for deriving singular value and 2-norm of reconstruction error, both of which are used for data analysis purpose. We provide our implementation on popular Spark framework for distributed platform. We compare our method against state-of-the-art library functions available for distributed settings, namely MLlib-PCA and Mahout-PCA with real big datasets. Our experiments show that our method outperforms both of them by a wide margin.

In order to assess the severity of difficulty faced by Entity Linking systems when working with the depositions we use them to create an evaluation corpus. This corpus is used as an input to the General Entity Annotator Benchmarking Framework a standard benchmarking platform for entity annotation systems. Based on this corpus and the results obtained from General Entity Annotator Benchmarking Framework we observe that the accuracy of existing Entity Linking systems is lacking when applied to content like these depositions. This is due to a number of issues ranging from problems with existing state-of-the-art systems to poor representation of historic entities in modern knowledge bases.

To this end, many knowledge base completion (KBC) methods have been proposed. However, most existing methods embed each relation into a vector separately, while ignoring the correlations among different relations. Actually, in large-scale KBs, there always exist some relations that are semantically related, and we believe this can help to facilitate the knowledge sharing when learning the embedding of related relations simultaneously. Along this line, we propose a novel KBC model by Multi -Task E mbedding, named MultiE. In this model, semantically related relations are first clustered into the same group, and then learning the embedding of each relation can leverage the knowledge among different relations. Moreover, we propose a three-layer network to predict the missing values of incomplete knowledge triples. Finally, experiments on three popular benchmarks FB15k, FB15k-237 and WN18 are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiE against some state-of-the-art baseline competitors.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"MultiE: Multi-Task Embedding for Knowledge Base Completion","journalPages":"1715-1718","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269295"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Experiment","Knowledge base","Loss function","Missing data","Multitier architecture","Relation (database)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ce668a88e34dc8df1a95c7292688413274b8ed0b","35547948c302f6aa30898bda94e7ee29dab463a2","33bc88dbc11a7833e724d8754f2b16c64c6a8b8f","ea5907c9b0742baa2593d3abf99b7d0084a902a9","07f294070b61e4c8aab30425027e9d08d9474ce2","01693180c4356634980ca2893c5777ff54438473","1d86ea624bd6d7f36aa29a0e5a3ae7fadacb7b8f","994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726","0a6d7e8e61c54c796f53120fdb86a25177e00998","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05","5b50842142ee3efdba0ba31dff322136cd42554d","01226d7b042bb91d10f5c9d0317e2531c1533e5a","bb75de5280ff9b0bbdd74633b9887d10fbe0ae10"],"id":"1c9aa41c0b21a2656128bac15e42344cf6cdb748","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1c9aa41c0b21a2656128bac15e42344cf6cdb748","authors":[{"name":"Zhao Zhang","ids":["3747964"]},{"name":"Fuzhen Zhuang","ids":["1799525"]},{"name":"Zheng-Yu Niu","ids":["2715551"]},{"name":"Deqing Wang","ids":["1792722"]},{"name":"Qing He","ids":["1745271"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269295"}

Coarse annotations (e.g., scribbles, coarse polygons) offer an economical alternative, with which training phase could hardly generate satisfactory performance unfortunately. In order to generate high-quality annotated data with a low time cost for accurate segmentation, in this paper, we propose a novel annotation enrichment strategy, which expands existing coarse annotations of training data to a finer scale. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks have shown that the neural networks trained with the enriched annotations from our framework yield a significant improvement over that trained with the original coarse labels. It is highly competitive to the performance obtained by using human annotated dense annotations. The proposed method also outperforms among other state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Coarse-to-Fine Annotation Enrichment for Semantic Segmentation Learning","journalPages":"237-246","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07209","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271672","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07209v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07209"],"entities":["Algorithm","Artificial neural network","Experiment","Gene Ontology Term Enrichment","Ground truth","Pascal","Pixel"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d9f9a4cc9d5a4360a32bc1acf3fd0a5916566a77","0cd032a93890d61b9bd187119abee0d6aeb899f7","cab372bc3824780cce20d9dd1c22d4df39ed081a","3b2ccc97f1433cf8750a2ad5a05555ccd10e9cdf","3d1e82b69663758a1db87fbebed6525d23090146","9201bf6f8222c2335913002e13fbac640fc0f4ec","a3d96844dc4fc3b51f3b8361c72f156800794251","39978ba7c83333475d6825d0ff897692933895fc","e56bb892c581f682052ddd3896c65a2b29e64612","0a8ab703839ae585c2f27099616c40974cbeeda2","33986219a5a11ac55505240625eaf222001f78f7","322a7dad274f440a92548faa8f2b2be666b2d01f","eaf6ed705b48aa8adc4404f1efe0963a85f42076","10e8ebc9a2397336cd03dda18842ad6e7e7299bb","7fbf1885f27fb72d5e553c4a2147375f928465ee","7a953aaf29ef67ee094943d4be50d753b3744573","1779b6a17ee68afafb6801477b165f19901689b2","7573ff84d71de19fe7d387bb4a6de73cb28402f4","a985aba7699d0904f51785608496526eede02d6e","37bda16c9f204c98d4c57a6be00cee3db520643d","333b877ea761c5c1d4ffa39654fc19bd015e245d","032bde9da87439c781a6c81ba7933985ed95d88e","6ef190ad2c9c6e11d12bc1b51a4c8a11a4692fb8","d676cd05051a1a7428d630926cc50c8772708a8f","0ee1916a0cb2dc7d3add086b5f1092c3d4beb38a","026050f71175d235f3f91ca0e99e994c00f9b5a6","90a4125974564a5ab6c2ce2ff685fc36e9cf0680","2f0486b7770c0a8d9cd37e0d73ea3495562511f3","5b79ae0d1fd60d61d1b7e37ffe499f50088554c0","e68ccc14da40f8a3c649930ae3110c0abeeb34ce","32cde90437ab5a70cf003ea36f66f2de0e24b3ab","18c39376487258f209f7c1bec36602416931c9a0","44566cbdd64d598beff4f5a0a2aa2b1fb4d0cdb2","7d95baaf70b8e7973b83ea7e42742ec33236e432","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088"],"id":"61c8dbe1762779c0f175c17e1099a8f06acd4bd3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/61c8dbe1762779c0f175c17e1099a8f06acd4bd3","authors":[{"name":"Yadan Luo","ids":["7988538"]},{"name":"Ziwei Wang","ids":["48707795"]},{"name":"Zi Xuan Huang","ids":["2484050"]},{"name":"Yang Yang","ids":["1708973"]},{"name":"Cong Zhao","ids":["48505147"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271672"}

This led to the creation of applications, called information extractors, that extract structured information from unstruc- tured data. The extracted information is stored in a Knowledge Base (KB). KB stores facts about entities like name, type and other attributes. My PhD thesis entitled 'Named Entity Extraction for Knowledgebase Enhancement' deals with information extraction on named entities with the purpose of enhancing a KB. The enhanced KB is in turn used by the information extraction task to refine the extraction process. Thus, KB provides structure and guidance to the extraction task, and gets enhanced by the results of the extraction task. Here we see that the tasks of entity extraction and KB enhancement are mutually dependent and mutually beneficial. Hence in my research I propose methods to enhance both the tasks, in an effort to build a strong and sound named entity extraction system. Named Entity Extraction, also known as Entity Linking (EL) in scientific literature, is the task of determining the identity of entities mentioned in text. EL helps automatic extraction of structured information about entities from unstructured data, which is stored in the KB. EL consists of Mention Detection and Entity Disambiguation. In my research, I propose methods to enhance mention detection, entity disambiguation and KB enhancement.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Named Entity Extraction for Knowledgebase Enhancement","journalPages":"169-170","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/p169.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3274784.3274807"],"entities":["Entity Bean","Entity linking","Information extraction","Knowledge base","Named entity","Scientific literature","Social media","Web 2.0","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"52","outCitations":["2a7c0f32b66d7c9bcf835c0c03e3c58bfd8daa83","3b19df310cd0fd8a1b07184f699f4eb6f72cfdf3","1ba4cba2c00dcdffe1a35f36d33e80326ae52b34","c248b121eb92afbf7607bd8b87d41a2f08369a28","03aa3c66aad11069e79d73108a92eeef3a43b40a","2535fcdd9ac10afbe6d7de5aaa67c496a569f01b","d88d8818c696af3f657b1772042ebf64d85ff35c"],"id":"4233f33782169abe35763fab3f018f4959a4511b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4233f33782169abe35763fab3f018f4959a4511b","authors":[{"name":"Priya Radhakrishnan","ids":["1876013"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3274784.3274807"}

This allows defining expressions with both client and server parts, and at the same time provides good static guarantees regarding client-server communication. However, these nice properties come at a cost: most tierless languages offer very poor support for modularity and separate compilation. To regain this modularity and offer a larger-scale notion of composition, we propose to leverage a well-known tool: ML-style modules. In modernML languages, the module system is a layer separate from the expression language. Eliom is an extension of OCaml for tierless Web programming which provides type-safe communication and an efficient execution model. In this article, we present how the Eliom module system combines the flexibility of tierless Web programming languages with a powerful module system, thus providing good support for abstraction, modularity and separate compilation. We also show that we can provide all these advantages while providing seamless integration with OCaml and its ecosystem.

However, with today's large variety of users and layouts this is not always the case. In this paper, we consider so-called complex ranking settings where it is not clear what should be displayed, that is, what the relevant items are, and how they should be displayed, that is, where the most relevant items should be placed. These ranking settings are complex as they involve both traditional ranking and inferring the best display order. Existing learning to rank methods cannot handle such complex ranking settings as they assume that the display order is known beforehand. To address this gap we introduce a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning method that is capable of learning complex rankings, both the layout and the best ranking given the layout, from weak reward signals. Our proposed method does so by selecting documents and positions sequentially, hence it ranks both the documents and positions, which is why we call it the Double Rank Model (DRM). Our experiments show that DRM outperforms all existing methods in complex ranking settings, thus it leads to substantial ranking improvements in cases where the display order is not known a priori.","inCitations":["4a329acc6e48a3c066c519e831f43bb01d22cd8d","b21999ed0fa901eb79bd1bfc42dd8e3e1e69112f"],"pmid":"","title":"Ranking for Relevance and Display Preferences in Complex Presentation Layouts","journalPages":"845-854","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02404v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209992","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02404","http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02404","https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/oosterhuis-ranking-2018.pdf"],"entities":["Experiment","Learning to rank","Reinforcement learning","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["dc69f55ab2d2f2ce57ff84f2006baf442089d95c","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","35f41f503e9aa32297225d6ebcece74faeafca34","2d26fcf385ee2c4baef9150d0870836f3ff0a0f9","6d0f5d4a43e60400b888d473387190a13882824b","b2c60ac2d5c18a74aa61542be5c1b3b4a3b3c8db","1772143a707f02685e3445485b89c888b2535e7a","28aef656a957721ddc5ccad2e64f858a4d1e004e","7c8822e4bff8eaa454a7a89bf13c443a16a85dd6","dd90dee12840f4e700d8146fb111dbc863a938ad","1fcd20daf49f4d5ef0265690693986461a09cc04","6712a40b544683a469c292ab5a8ae087ce217c2f","2309cbad9a85ccafb71d0521ebec4d59ddee0f57","33896ae0045cc70aaa2063ec9460fb760e2439b9","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","3bd42cfb7e633320bbeec7f6d361e92abec60b07","06a8a58e123848b708cddbe00d9ace7d2c4cc431","6ca69efb04c7ec24c3544668a261dd5514bef008","27c4c5f2adcd93f97f88e658be6b3284507af9fe","749d0d639c133bd329d43cb8be47f9aba2063679","1d81f37488a6c492d5dd2733d485c9b014e9eeb4","340f48901f72278f6bf78a04ee5b01df208cc508","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","32c41d63c721fcb476125d5ab487e80d8ac83cff","9e1f1dd09a10dfb0215beb437e34412cdd30bbbf","3b9732bb07dc99bde5e1f9f75251c6ea5039373e","b5e781ec05b89255bcbf62f57e95641602e85bbe","aadf66ee5933cd446c562fa510bad3c3afe3c1fa","d46a52c2f229efbd42f2c3d9aca301ecfb7ba2a5"],"id":"6b0ebbaea9e91d904b1923b470fbf9a49314f620","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6b0ebbaea9e91d904b1923b470fbf9a49314f620","authors":[{"name":"Harrie Oosterhuis","ids":["37910069"]},{"name":"Maarten de Rijke","ids":["1696030"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3209992"}

Previous studies mostly deal with this task in either supervised or unsupervised manner according to whether label information is available. However, there always exists settings which are different from the two standard manners. In this paper, we address the scenario when anomalies are partially observed, i.e., we are given a large amount of unlabeled instances as well as a handful labeled anomalies. We refer to this problem as anomaly detection with partially observed anomalies, and proposed a two-stage method ADOA to solve it. Firstly, by addressing the difference between the anomalies, the observed anomalies are clustered, while the unlabeled instances are filtered to get potential anomalies and reliable normal instances. Then, with the above instances, a weight is attached to each instance according to the confidence of its label, and a weightedmulti-class model is built, which will be further used to distinguish different anomalies to the normal instances. Experimental results show that in the aforementioned setting, existing methods behave unsatisfactorily and the proposed method performs significantly better than all these methods, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","inCitations":["cc9e47e55166960f29b733f71debd8ae921a81d4"],"pmid":"","title":"Anomaly Detection with Partially Observed Anomalies","journalPages":"639-646","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/add4/59d9d37743dc2baad703fe17f794cb6b5d3f.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3186580","http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/www18bw.pdf"],"entities":["Anomaly detection","Experiment","Malware","Supervised learning","Synthetic intelligence","Unsupervised learning","Verification and validation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["096566065fa92aa4c2a9cd273a15f4a7f5932576","0f17c798597372ad819b4c87181b2bfd7ebf38bb","0cdf9697538c46db78a948ede0f9b0c605b71d26","741abfcb621d9aa19aa79e4aa5c5cddb1473b3da","03ca91b71422d677d01ebf1d4ef7e5b0006ee7a4","1ffcb27536ab5436e6d753919ab27ac1a44b4b69","03b3f0b58e14d7840303e52b17e023fb54667fdc","634e2f1a20755e7ab18e8e8094f48e140a32dacd","006b577653e0e91e1cfd37c32c6d1cfb198a730e","555e36baa734ffa4c6e4947a49e5085c990dad83","d47c0c2dcc53865c5d462351326d68fa4f0b51af","05208596000c9671338dfdc653ea7f9a818c6a83","14b8827990b01608d28929a7995fc6eed5eea85f","1860f84062d513be68d7e6db67e27ddd3f2f5319","b65fc8f5e7329f0476bc7280f0ef6b91a8c8484b","16a3608ddd0ee149a87e2be4b23908496e36f9b2","4de653c3a986c78a39904d43a5c93e6d1f04c006","0d8595526203c5e956c1b81f1ca9d5c50af17e8d","784cbb81ee7123361a5689bf40c0646a7d462d82","afad7b96465083f93bf6a632a25d15cbed8c8921","2981e8267135dae55c0c061ee214e888ecbef099","644eecb63afba825d69e67e9d9d709e76210b72f","0929e10042cfcc228cca9f821f669179efb0e4ca","0278bbaf1db5df036f02393679d485260b1daeb7","07486a6e01a64634ece368eea7820bcd862f4d15","0c0d0b372b369f0d4f2009e7425d9868b87ff009","adba54e83de565aa6e303b7c5341603008fb44f3","0bad381b84f48b28abc1a98f05993c8eb5be747d","d5a54fd964d2b85bc059bbb436522a44b02c5358"],"id":"add459d9d37743dc2baad703fe17f794cb6b5d3f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/add459d9d37743dc2baad703fe17f794cb6b5d3f","authors":[{"name":"Ya-Lin Zhang","ids":["40382994"]},{"name":"Longfei Li","ids":["2151580"]},{"name":"Jun Zhou","ids":["49640379"]},{"name":"Xiaolong Li","ids":["2967870"]},{"name":"Zhi-Hua Zhou","ids":["1692625"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3186580"}

Linking identical users across different social networks, also known as the User Identity Linkage (UIL), is an important problem of great research challenges and practical value. Most existing UIL models are supervised or semi-supervised and a considerable number of manually matched user identity pairs are required, which is costly in terms of labor and time. In addition, existing methods generally rely heavily on some discriminative common user attributes, and thus are hard to be generalized. Motivated by the isomorphism across social networks, in this paper we consider all the users in a social network as a whole and perform UIL from the user space distribution level. The insight is that we convert the unsupervised UIL problem to the learning of a projection function to minimize the distance between the distributions of user identities in two social networks. We propose to use the earth mover's distance (EMD) as the measure of distribution closeness, and propose two models UUIL$_gan $ and UUIL$_omt $ to efficiently learn the distribution projection function. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed models over multiple social network datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Distribution Distance Minimization for Unsupervised User Identity Linkage","journalPages":"447-456","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271675"],"entities":["Centrality","Linkage (software)","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Social network","Supervised learning","Transformation matrix","Unsupervised learning","User space"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["194c2eec28f70ac7da28c7d9f73f65351a181df2","697b3683a914bcf27bb93e8f2de6be8f565d383a","b3007a1b6330b9d28991856b09d489f99dd28a09","cb1f00540e5562120c11a867ba41f3b617f35e01","da7ee47ee1ccee8080f5827c3c8ee60af90e5fa0","ecbda6a128718aea7a985b6f8cd68a5354b6b0ac","fa3fa8e3d83e879097ac6190eb62bb143a1764a5","8d3feb186556ead77590979b42c42374549a1166","88c53dfbb1902b68c0e985d48074d248f4604838","6b880d58b826074c49d0a38d0f9fb481e93c0acc","07ba4a933f34064a03a8e05be8f6de3492b3448e","13fbf3d657dd8d684d8e0f7ed30488c23a1073da","9ffd24715d9509f7f5683edd2b9952fd5846f567","17290865103d143b39beaabfe0d0a83003238aa2","03f17f3e364e754fdc01cb3b283e1cb8b9df3baa","4a7a2e40cdeb2bf43787b5a96d1fc9b255911e1a","29785276197d4a748aab346bda2b4fb5f869d451","30cb434e7955f48145a10b7306c94c0433f8443e","1a51e5c06e141eb23ec17071b681155332f1d22e","7527abf57973e7fee11bdfe1566bc3a3863d8b91","4210f095629a1488aebd224d585ebc0af9261d59","270f74378d1e569742b535037c166d23790a4299","b8038b993d3651d5ba268be2892c2fb09f9f8083","4945909e68d43f8cf5bb2e761cc100ae9891ec8e","8e2862ebdfe7d3cca379bce83ad3487b107b2787","34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","f428b0bfec203194c7473e7d83a8e50b222417dd","53987d229586c8457c716a4dd831d9cee9890921","326cfa1ffff97bd923bb6ff58d9cb6a3f60edbe5","00a4eef18b0236875dc3785eb6996d374e78714a","0080118b0eb02af581ff32b85a1bb6aed7081f45","642ce4d2de1e159af563143b2bdde706c0b0f7d2","c091085afac61f9b7210e24e99e22902e4601b98","3901d293cc96811b25ce543fc4dc2593f432cf52","295ad06bbaca2dc4262dd834d051e12324ef69c4","6de2b1058c5b717878cce4e7e50d3a372cc4aaa6","bd1ec21830a6bb7d7826ac81f75927f2892a4ba6","4659d36f89c7bd422f077300f7d2798a0c3cef40","50681b5f3666bc730986263fde588c5000e93874","a17e6c1c6f4a99d6c87b8c6315876379b823d806","bc1554f17d9d16dc13fd526804a75e3fe13c3970","84fa751d61a4a4a9bc375fcd1ada4cc28b5139db","23682ad5e9977dc4c3485d937a80ec0199436b92","935aeb0dd9327625c7aaa516bc822f75c962d58a","fc60f2e1147d754911334f4ba88ce9d92a535990","8c568753edf901e90aa99509ad0a7f7a6c9ca1a1","448fd962a195c6ff196ca5962b3eb7afb896d9e3"],"id":"c1edc6dc088b8860bfb440822c8e2fc769e9970e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c1edc6dc088b8860bfb440822c8e2fc769e9970e","authors":[{"name":"Chaozhuo Li","ids":["2869810"]},{"name":"Senzhang Wang","ids":["3210262"]},{"name":"Philip S.

Identifying this type of bot is particularly challenging, with state-of-the-art methods utilising large volumes of network data as features for machine learning models. Such datasets are generally not readily available in typical applications which stream social media data for real-time event prediction. In this work we develop a methodology to detect content polluters in social media datasets that are streamed in real-time. Applying our method to the problem of civil unrest event prediction in Australia, we identify content polluters from individual tweets, without collecting social network or historical data from individual accounts. We identify some peculiar characteristics of these bots in our dataset and propose metrics for identification of such accounts. We then pose some research questions around this type of bot detection, including: how good Twitter is at detecting content polluters and how well state-of-the-art methods perform in detecting bots in our dataset.","inCitations":["9c62021349c40b0e8e4c42bbbeeb912aa0600c54","8d7607b5bc6b1627f30d61976ef543a990a15cac"],"pmid":"","title":"Real-time Detection of Content Polluters in Partially Observable Twitter Networks","journalPages":"1331-1339","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d128/4145ce1f08dbef18dbc0b3f2f2d8248fee87.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1804.01235","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01235","https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3191574","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01235v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01235"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3864116203583e54f4edfcf832cbe8ed3ea55629","84d3018ef66a230d34471dc663925d54ffa7d2d0","9a2c543f12cd02686703c399cdab97822094962a","c13cc48ca3b40304c45c41e570150972f9057a8b","a5ce1a22c2c824f5151a08c4c0a5e42fe5eb7fab","9b8879ffbc424cc47f7a599411532feac237933c","09ff2ee123c38590e649ef29e1065f0c49d00f21","136d0daa5d918dfebe8a26a6991053ef372892ea","99820176fa97db2cff3afe78aac5f957bfc0def7","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","5968541124b94f2bc30b06f4a9cf2775ad02fc17","4948b089ac744e41a262aa98e89f655b74f47193","4e0790712baa616d99769a0ccc6f63851936737a","91ee82cee43520aea3dcbed52f91d2edf679da30","027620c83ce89c951c8d547274003c6a643307fb","ce19928fc3afa8a389546f5030552269bafd43eb","35795c913347d1386404d1bb922b01cb1f51265a","1f779bb04bf3510cc8b0fc8f5dba896f5e4e6b95","65f5f73e074f6d3471a7a495e35bc2510288e5d5","b2c4dbb779753ce84d5d56c2918bd07b9b4fce04","7a6823d16a1dc680c9bdfe03dc4caccbe2e944b6","92c9b1a71399bab883f79c3c85b3ae9211fcbf3f","832e652f5b78d61b37e70f42e14fb298ec1ba9ff","592029f9e20af564602e8a7a512d2924e999fa08","c838232b6a45a59ec71d7a3a0ceaec4bf2fc29e1","27efd568fe5968b0953ac651d70c9abfc6e1d5e4","36b09b03a8c13bd9f1f3aa0f582faa52e3d278a4","1dd5355e62b9fc37a355e135d5909ed28128d653","82a3477daf965a07979bf76e340219ab6aba9cd4","02fd02b1789716d55a784df1f26895c18deba13f","c0c7f7e4cb004a03f09e985166b6fb25aaa0b428","4a2d18071e0f2c5088a333d56494ba1558f8fbaf","06ca9508324ddc0fafe44f00f4f4c2906a7cbc87"],"id":"d1284145ce1f08dbef18dbc0b3f2f2d8248fee87","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d1284145ce1f08dbef18dbc0b3f2f2d8248fee87","authors":[{"name":"Mehwish Nasim","ids":["40650641"]},{"name":"Andrew Nguyen","ids":["48721075"]},{"name":"Nick Lothian","ids":["3365954"]},{"name":"Robert C Cope","ids":["3521869"]},{"name":"Lewis Mitchell","ids":["13568600"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3191574"}

Current ADR surveillance systems are often associated with a substantial time lag before such events are officially published. On the other hand, online social media such as Twitter contain information about ADR events in real-time, much before any official reporting. Current state-of-the-art methods in ADR mention extraction use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which typically need large labeled corpora. Towards this end, we propose a semi-supervised method based on co-training which can exploit a large pool of unlabeled tweets to augment the limited supervised training data, and as a result enhance the performance. Experiments with ∼0.1M tweets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the ADR mention extraction task by ∼5% in terms of F1 score.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Co-training for Extraction of Adverse Drug Reaction Mentions from Tweets","journalPages":"556-562","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0552/aeb2270f7612e7c93cdc53050eb80a90823e.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_44","http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05121","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05121v1.pdf"],"entities":["Co-training","F1 score","Find-a-drug","Flight recorder","Neural Networks","Random neural network","Real-time transcription","Recurrent neural network","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Social media","Supervised learning","Text corpus"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","15a3ed7dfc005aa6f84f1e1fb81ef6d54ce3d8aa","b06d3ce0a824d58be3a74d892fc8a5b6d5925c22","86969cbbfe866e15f9f7dafb9e6f1631b256d8c2","9534417313469290bb28aeb71c5fb5c71f76d699","de481259aeccffd2dbdcea8c4e9fa0ab8cd32c8b","06d51deada6e771a2571807a47dd991120c8dd1a","583aef90d21360c2a406af2f2323b7cfa86be532","9be7d5bcee2128021fcf31d638e10d96fd6684a4","83942e8727d4deacbb8fdf9a0ac5668f9a388160","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","15cf63f8d44179423b4100531db4bb84245aa6f1","7b4f3d0e4e2486a8d5d3f8e00549cf9a117bf88f","228651a77b5434795b3674acfe190ff74236975a"],"id":"0552aeb2270f7612e7c93cdc53050eb80a90823e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0552aeb2270f7612e7c93cdc53050eb80a90823e","authors":[{"name":"Shashank Gupta","ids":["40014740"]},{"name":"Manish Gupta","ids":["29960724"]},{"name":"Vasudeva Varma","ids":["1704709"]},{"name":"Sachin Pawar","ids":["2831129"]},{"name":"Nitin Ramrakhiyani","ids":["2562330"]},{"name":"Girish Keshav Palshikar","ids":["1747097"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_44"}

People often have implicit preferences while listening to music, though these preferences might not always be the same while they listen to music at different times. For example, a user might be interested in listening to songs of only a particular artist at some time, and the same user might be interested in the top-rated songs of a genre at another time. In this paper we try to explicitly model the short term preferences of the user with the help of Last.fm tags of the songs the user has listened to. With a session defined as a period of activity surrounded by periods of inactivity, we introduce the concept of a subsession, which is that part of the session wherein the preference of the user does not change much. We assume the user preference might change within a session and a session might have multiple subsessions. We use our modelling of the user preferences to generate recommendations for the next song the user might listen to. Experiments on the user listening histories taken from Last.fm indicate that this approach beats the present methodologies in predicting the next recording a user might listen to.","inCitations":["1a30fd889b808dac8ebc489521bffbea9bfecda0","762a582c28c09920507c955acfa052f9446ee823","05dcf18ef993df015715eb31a8ca774fd2ff8e94"],"pmid":"","title":"Explicit Modelling of the Implicit Short Term User Preferences for Music Recommendation","journalPages":"333-344","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3dee/5cd73168dfdc0e3eed83b417999ca5f4370c.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/download/inproceedings.pdf.ae0e8933ea724faf.4578706c69636974204d6f64656c6c696e67206f662074686520496d706c696369742053686f7274205465726d20557365722e2e2e20284b617274696b2047757074612026206f7468657273292e706466.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_25"],"entities":["Experiment","File sharing","Last.fm","Recommender system","User (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6a94f16627379a7163f39a5b909c41b5167d3889","27211ed68a7a00f1df0121fa1890a1b2acdd1a88","69a8c9d0f3a58d6dcd2a5cd4c076673462ff9645","00cbb42367566a70e3c541d93b5873565b9b1288","c7f5ea73191dd89b26dc183f1c8fa125e4b18ed7","6d0d0612db10a572bfe9b8879d6c5be3c9a7106c","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","6e06a1796bf36b2f0896a3e350a972e3160c7d66","b9c2228f37c0fb7a1233046037d7015aa8696397","34e9cfe143f8eb2e3c451c165ac53eec0a9a0449","714544b7cf35a3b8bdc12fb1967624a38f257a42","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","47ab879139457c9cadf25ca37f00bc5fa9b4c453","66fe86387291fdef89ef02bf7a89995ac2f712ea","7776b1c15b4f7907b965ea52b3da23b45cfc2b2b"],"id":"3dee5cd73168dfdc0e3eed83b417999ca5f4370c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3dee5cd73168dfdc0e3eed83b417999ca5f4370c","authors":[{"name":"Kartik Gupta","ids":["2882136"]},{"name":"Noveen Sachdeva","ids":["40705044"]},{"name":"Vikram Pudi","ids":["1787044"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_25"}

But it is this very dimension that leads to the risk of privacy infringement and raises serious public concerns. In this work, we propose a client-centered intent-aware query obfuscation solution for protecting user privacy in a personalized web search scenario. In our solution, each user query is submitted with l additional cover queries and corresponding clicks, which act as decoys to mask users' genuine search intent from a search engine. The cover queries are sequentially sampled from a set of hierarchically organized language models to ensure the coherency of fake search intents in a cover search task. Our approach emphasizes the plausibility of generated cover queries, not only to the current genuine query but also to previous queries in the same task, to increase the complexity for a search engine to identify a user's true intent. We also develop two new metrics from an information theoretic perspective to evaluate the effectiveness of provided privacy protection. Comprehensive experiment comparisons with state-of-the-art query obfuscation techniques are performed on the public AOL search log, and the propitious results substantiate the effectiveness of our solution.","inCitations":["d8069d81a3bfae4fbbc1f08a983d7d2f19c77c7b"],"pmid":"","title":"Intent-aware Query Obfuscation for Privacy Protection in Personalized Web Search","journalPages":"285-294","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/paper/SIGIR2018-IQP.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209983"],"entities":["Information theory","Language model","Obfuscation (software)","Personalization","Personalized search","Plausibility structure","Privacy","Usability testing","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9658614658541a108d10b518103f66b6eaae32aa","3dd3e986fda5541a039239c8b5c705b030ecc73f","6dabd3476b70581075dab379f745d02ee419e1e2","2319da70ccbf9958882c91ca70d7b06dfe7bc8f6","a8b916062661ddacc54d586fa5676344130b84b5","505253630ab7e8f35e26e27904bd3c8faea3c5ce","85f25c2811b15ba26dd55204089d6360accd173b","f7ebd552c8917250f4f4051dbec5d2414d0b39d3","43470bb883f0fdef2d74edb703c9d760456e230c","94a3987bff95bfbb38a3ac0bc3e435aa7b27492d","d8069d81a3bfae4fbbc1f08a983d7d2f19c77c7b","ac33d71b96985d590cb11e97af2b00e866235dd2","533b8e2a4bd4d2be358ac90431826f68958bf80f","87b1a29aff2ad8a2dd6a2ec442fef51d411d2880","0ddc065cc92046857d35555c3af4ade1310aca4a","25494a7e6244a61d47f6e7da8ac8221eb92f1089","8b65d9778bf88a941639a4167059ed1feb2deb29","cabacc3098219a9b508e6b6e9360979566841dec","6e9dcf3c20ead59059d32ae937859b796deff4fa","1eeac96f45de0be69c0aa6ed21e48a6345002eef","9e065299d33ec134f3f25099a484d22c6840bcad","049262f31708a51c1952eb3f7b301f5fc22907d0","afaa1636e44246ebf8f3c27ad32fca9a8ce5f0a1","93169bf90e63a45182955df696d27d863f053751","edfb5a6a4328af93536a284566684b1d3f9306b9","3168dcbdce9ba0f8076133da4ffa6e6732484a4a","2ce9eb52608443e7574f35a0b356a5325987f64a","a0b02090f8ed555e581d8136f19c46bfc7f394c9","5e29280c2715c63d0c69b7864408165bf30d5439","c5e183451e30e42d74e3f1e4d811e1156f286e51","32d4316b9d149c6d96cc8a2d1aea4a1ac4aef3b9","1a2172d0aefe8464cc9ca802164b49ce95b3f750","1b09897efc55443c10b4aca8c7ec3dffd6d2e4be","ab320e328f28efea3b983185b732ab435e28699d","3a9793acf40c10021648dcadb3d32818b8181500","663f4f32b643376f36b5bcbee65cc32cb9f11de4","a96c964064c3e34bf543f73dd17f70a840d89126","366862ca872ad9ddba0183d922be385b0ed0df1e","d9e43b5772f35cd98cf833324c85f1a2541438bb","2ffe9908394655f8bac7e264be2fe6718b704de3","1e680495d2437649c77144ae9bfbd563ac8eed8b","3f63dbd9cbda059bbf683ebf77c40f9c28b680e3","9f353e7a9e8209dc8438c5654624e0eba5a2f832","5c09522b3fbea3c43ca7194e222051a5c85739f6","01fa57bd91f731522c861404d29e4604ba6ac6d3","57ff38e4041ef70661ce1c9e280a8d302ec757a9","555daedf3625fc0b01598303d6fdc557d8a097fc","514c57027ecc50672ee78cbcf33d7cdd245aa6f8","032374cb7a7d66a092dcf81b0ee3eaa9a08fd9ae"],"id":"26af964b752e8349216fbad9b4216cbd9781ecb7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/26af964b752e8349216fbad9b4216cbd9781ecb7","authors":[{"name":"Wasi Uddin Ahmad","ids":["38123220"]},{"name":"Kai-Wei Chang","ids":["2782886"]},{"name":"Hongning Wang","ids":["31825390"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3209983"}

However, there is limited effort in scaling the pairwise ranking methods in a large scale distributed setting. In this paper we address the scalability aspect of a pairwise ranking method using Factorization Machines in distributed settings. Our proposed method is based on a block partitioning of the model parameters so that each distributed worker runs stochastic gradient updates on an independent block. We developed a dynamic block creation and exchange strategy by utilizing the frequency of occurrence of a feature in the local training data of a worker. Empirical evidence on publicly available benchmark datasets indicates that the proposed method scales better than the static block based methods and outperforms competing state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Towards Distributed Pairwise Ranking using Implicit Feedback","journalPages":"973-976","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210113"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Distributed algorithm","Experiment","Gradient","Image scaling","Scalability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0144941d255dad89d3d90c2d131a15cc01df9829","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","1e96b0c0ac74070a984fec94f085109839d842a9","2b9ed535a2ab9296850e8c11678f07e84ac748a3","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","0e9bac6a2b51e93e73f7f5045d4252972db10b5a","c32e8d3d86695d2da36ccfce60d51956e2e4818c","7d50b6883c38e34016a4841ec4ab2b92bfdfe3ad","06c96833b24092810c58fb9b9564dcbbe9f8d255","42dbc367a7f9612b30bd590323e071450d149fb4","2d56cf126ad0d2ce86dbce566caca3da4c0e371e","e50f4d3316d13841c287dcdf5479d7820d593571","a9653a27052d666b7ed47524871dc9c3a9b92cc4","30e94e24d67994c5a8e2f20f852a51d28a720de2"],"id":"902cd8395cdef5e7257d84a368dafbeb7189d271","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/902cd8395cdef5e7257d84a368dafbeb7189d271","authors":[{"name":"Mohsan Jameel","ids":["1929785"]},{"name":"Nicolas Schilling","ids":["2385585"]},{"name":"Lars Schmidt-Thieme","ids":["1747322"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210113"}

Our statistical approach solves the name extraction task with a good tradeoff between generality and precision.

One of the reasons the World Wide Web is so successful is the fact that most content is available free of any charge. Inspired by the success of the World Wide Web, the Web of Data applies the same strategy of interlinking to data. To this point, most of data in the Web of Data is also free of charge. The fact that the data is freely available raises the question of financing these services, however. As we will discuss in this paper, advertisement and donations cannot easily be applied to this new setting. To create incentives to subsidize data providers, we propose that sponsors should pay the providers to promote sponsored data. In return, sponsored data will be privileged over non-sponsored data. Since it is not possible to enforce a certain ordering on the data the user will receive, we propose to split up the data into different batches and deliver these batches with different delays. In this way, we can privilege sponsored data without withholding any non-sponsored data from the user. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a delayed-answer auction, where sponsors can pay to prioritize their data. We introduce a new model which captures the particular situation when a user access data in the Web of Data. We show how the weighted Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism can be applied to our scenario and we discuss how certain parameters can influence the nature of our auction. With our new concept, we build a first step to a free yet financial sustainable Web of Data.

In particular, Reddit users freely discuss such issues on various subreddits, whose structure and content can be leveraged to formally interpret and relate subreddits and their posts in terms of mental health diagnostic categories. There is prior research on the extraction of mental health-related information, including symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments from social media; however, our approach can additionally provide actionable information to clinicians about the mental health of a patient in diagnostic terms for web-based intervention. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of the nature of subreddit content from domain expert's perspective and introduce a novel approach to map each subreddit to the best matching DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th Edition) category using multi-class classifier. Our classification algorithm analyzes all the posts of a subreddit by adapting topic modeling and word-embedding techniques, and utilizing curated medical knowledge bases to quantify relationship to DSM-5 categories. Our semantic encoding-decoding optimization approach reduces the false-alarm-rate from 30% to 2.5% over a comparable heuristic baseline, and our mapping results have been verified by domain experts achieving a kappa score of 0.84.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"\"Let Me Tell You About Your Mental Health!\": Contextualized Classification of Reddit Posts to DSM-5 for Web-based Intervention","journalPages":"753-762","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://knoesis.wright.edu/sites/default/files/ManasGaur_Knoesis_CIKM2018-min.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56585900"],"entities":["Algorithm","Baseline (configuration management)","DrugBank","Heuristic","IBM Notes","Lexicon","Lingo (programming language)","Mathematical optimization","MedDRA","Multiclass classification","Social media","Subject-matter expert","Synthetic data","Topic model","Web application"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2138b37bfced70599d26dfccbf93a8e7a4b7ad85","d5f3456fc5bac323be173547bc5b66d11d0cc21a","ce6d48a7fb0de0efad4ed8c01f9bcfb0986e88e0","437e31822a7a56b334d4c5beb01bacf6dfaf0f95","6805602945cae435bb820cdc26e8a3b61e8d1892","177a08d228fec9187bff8dca13e5f659a02fed4b","d2560d968b26fe0d8cdc5e8346626bfa41c2c6d6","2a0b2f1dc84a35a2d186edaf24fae92d8f1883e9","0c0256f0ae8bb81ddc4e024faeebdd0363cb4c29","2a752f9d927bc183b0e9c7ae78d220fa73b88e93","01deebfc9e8ab895385a12cbe15545acb2186601","21eca7e3d85784b0ce27e7a188bc9aa0f5d22465","fa3a6c61d1e1b02880301eb0ef0da0d4641968d3","db18707579c35e7171f0c6d33af67faefa1f2ab2","22004a82df67a542ef687a51005e9e16fc53fecc","17f3d2e72441fd636f9bbf087438dbcd430f43c9","3eda39823c9c1a41f9854fc351de9c2a87851046","4f2c61043c5af002050e3d9f5e5108b98d83fef5","537db6c2984514d92a754a591841e2e20845985a","1d526fe3bbd26e3beb02ba2e289e5bf6074bf8bb","3abdd6b45b9572e619d574fe342d58fcf283ac83","7360fa99ab548aec6027eb9f1943ecfb164c7d24","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","dea602a5285956756660e4c53c39280c2d057336","72bedbf7ed03c50915270c3f06e63ce5ab966626","06554235c2c9361a14c0569206b58a355a63f01b","d3790ca55931da96b619928539b201a6059733ee","319764d09e38c9bb3508ca57fe8173ba46e271b3","afdfaadb5b4443688b84d964c1da9f2682df1694","9f7f5dad0fd0bd03050fc68176b859bc9f8f0b2b","6e16a62acb76065d031fbd46b3a2af2b1499dc8c","55f6ab5d6671f71947fda30d8019a4392d028bea","5e30bba6ff2bdf63814bf581ad1e82f6fc627af9","ee932d0929a8b2c79e29b5a051524c08e4746f50","063bc63ab6d8cb21b65ecd2a63730c5fb746880a","8b053d14ec9eefb75cc12f8ad28b0fa65bf9aec9","1335472a8eb3edf3bf18f512e0cf5ecc0e22717c","d7205a5ecd9a3555a5eee5e31079451d965cc999","6455015a322d827b97b508d6775c25d5e689e514"],"id":"45d072541feed3df55561ed1da44d736ecf63240","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/45d072541feed3df55561ed1da44d736ecf63240","authors":[{"name":"Manas Gaur","ids":["3072757"]},{"name":"Ugur Kursuncu","ids":["2753547"]},{"name":"Daisuke Obara","ids":["51464693"]},{"name":"Amit P.

Significant progresses have been made by deep neural networks. However, background information and hidden relations beyond the context, which play crucial roles in human text comprehension, have received little attention in recent deep neural networks that achieve the state of the art in ranking QA pairs. In the paper, we propose KABLSTM, a Knowledge-aware Attentive Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, which leverages external knowledge from knowledge graphs (KG) to enrich the representational learning of QA sentences. Specifically, we develop a context-knowledge interactive learning architecture, in which a context-guided attentive convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to integrate knowledge embeddings into sentence representations. Besides, a knowledge-aware attention mechanism is presented to attend interrelations between each segments of QA pairs. KABLSTM is evaluated on two widely-used benchmark QA datasets: WikiQA and TREC QA. Experiment results demonstrate that KABLSTM has robust superiority over competitors and sets state-of-the-art.","inCitations":["b072513aab92e64320dd6abccf132d79ccdefa70","dd29e5b9e6ab9396daa4cf545b4dfef4e64b6be4"],"pmid":"","title":"Knowledge-aware Attentive Neural Network for Ranking Question Answer Pairs","journalPages":"901-904","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210081"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Benchmark (computing)","Convolutional neural network","Deep learning","Google Questions and Answers","Information retrieval","Kasparov's Gambit","Knowledge Graph","List comprehension","Long short-term memory","QA & UX Manager","Question answering","Software quality assurance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4d0f00b4b8287c74f790f0156815471e6182fbaa","68e4aedc69518d8db2f143bd3952668aa41c762c","1261fe9bfde319abcc5d011bc70f7e7547b5258f","bc34eee11d8ddba18a262a637ea336322c93ba6c","c051cfabf26e75e4af2edfeec86f633a7d76590f","c48e5ae2cdeb2b0b52268ad5099d7c27a76c2e6b","52956422f86722aca6becb67ea4c3ad61f0c1aea","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","828dbeb7cf922dc9b6657dd169b8d26d2b58eedb","28e94fca05a18f3611d8ab455f23bdefb88a7518","03fe39386ce90e10ec87f10e00532c5cf30b244f"],"id":"acb19932620452deab36b24a24b139f17224f469","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/acb19932620452deab36b24a24b139f17224f469","authors":[{"name":"Ying Shen","ids":["48234803"]},{"name":"Yang Deng","ids":["48362872"]},{"name":"Min Yang","ids":["48857157"]},{"name":"Yaliang Li","ids":["2694924"]},{"name":"Nan Du","ids":["1714086"]},{"name":"Wei Fan","ids":["46193609"]},{"name":"Kai Lei","ids":["1784737"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210081"}

Specifically, the stance detection is to detect four kinds of stances (\u201cagree\u201d, \u201cdisagree\u201d, \u201cdiscuss\u201d and \u201cunrelated\u201d) of the news towards a claim. Existing methods tried to tackle the stance detection problem by classification-based algorithms. However, classification-based algorithms make a strong assumption that there is clear distinction between any two stances, which may not be held in the context of stance detection. Accordingly, we frame the detection problem as a ranking problem and propose a rankingbased method to improve detection performance. Compared with the classification-based methods, the ranking-based method compare the true stance and false stances and maximize the difference between them. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Ranking-based Method for News Stance Detection","journalPages":"41-42","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a550/e691ea465771f7b03f6b501a22627ea3c4ba.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3186919","http://repository.kaust.edu.sa/kaust/bitstream/10754/627607/1/p41-zhang.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Information source","Veracity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["95a72b91db11f33384fd7b159561bf182c8c8d95","88a38d820a4dde01111112263ea1db5db97d0ab7"],"id":"a550e691ea465771f7b03f6b501a22627ea3c4ba","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a550e691ea465771f7b03f6b501a22627ea3c4ba","authors":[{"name":"Qiang Zhang","ids":["47834901"]},{"name":"Emine Yılmaz","ids":["35466594"]},{"name":"Shangsong Liang","ids":["3279808"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3186919"}

This is especially true for visual work like graphic design. Using designs shared on an online social network of professional digital designers, we measure visual novelty using statistical learning methods to compare an image's features with those of images that have been created before. We then relate social network position to the novelty of the designer's images. We find that on this professional platform, users with dense local networks tend to produce more novel but generally less successful images, with important exceptions. Namely, users making novel images while embedded in cohesive local networks are more successful.","inCitations":["ebe73a7549897bd4e226cf24b7a5c3f41c988679"],"pmid":"","title":"And Now for Something Completely Different: Visual Novelty in an Online Network of Designers","journalPages":"163-172","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1804.05705","https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201088","http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05705","https://johanneswachs.com/papers/websci_novelty.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05705v2.pdf"],"entities":["Embedded system","Exception handling","Machine learning","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e9224a3775e5eb35dc15f2903d21436c9f2641ac","23694b6d61668e62bb11f17c1d75dde3b4951948","bce3a871f856f815e8747254b8015190d171756b","a12d1ee2c6afdca1d72f140082ee6eb79b6d7b62","ae4e7dc7d2cb0be74b9f4e2eec23a06c3bd94a41","8772877ceb40d6d8685655145034740f3df7baad","45a153a0140c6c48c627dc215449ee7856be0068","7910db191d302df3341ca680afd4880111eb09c8","175c3ff2da72e998e25c0c47bcfa1816ea69d356","3b3141cd6eb0db69614186ba9b6ab45484666e50","2c411a12f33f15451e1659a3435391962c0cc144","d172ef0dafee17f08d9ef7867337878ed5cd2971","1e20e9fd5a4d0d8e14e436f0cf95ee5300fae8e0","a88037b6f2be619f34fbb4ba4c9bcc1fa2142975","14d23964de88419273079764da61cf541a8298c6","f1512c783953cc8b1667d2ee948f7fa9e68ed8c9","b36ef7990cc517cf6817332cda11da6ea5812bae","df01d2dede1a243b9b0eb26c27246bc13705d930","9e8d87dc5d8a6dd832716a3f358c1cdbfa97074c","8300cb5942025a8e8ea63cd9daca887fe40b7867","7853ddcdcdbadd50b9d09e8d28e449298b984d3b","b7560d02393b230b81a277c24637a4fd538c9701","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","712abc0435cef793a4636ba095f9863f4976a262","0de6fa5bfb007aad551b0537876feb869f45418b","349d7be32ea92ae1912ffc8dc98eafe7bd0f016d","7e53d4fbde55a3d7054bba32cbfe718837aa3dc4","01f0b6186a415b12d3a7171d33529b2727c974d2","582ea307db25c5764e7d2ed82c4846757f4e95d7","87fa50f0e3534fcda0b9022ff9e02a51985e9b10","27f49deabd2c97ac38ec938542a9f628e73a59e6","820b1349751d7e932b74c3de94b96557fa2534cf","1a3231e63d8afd8abdd6cb30ef3d37f82db93085","536845bbf379fd380ea2485aa883163205b0210d","2c0552c1b3a91801cccd781b8850bda8018ebfe2","400c0a728b9e44c5e88fe6baace1b5ed53c68216","1e2c0d3502ca1998069192e4bcd5ce16e67d8231","11497ff7c2b0676e774da7f0fd7ca3a89828b38a","f7625798c6e08daa9a603551c71bab68f9abe5dd","14318685b5959b51d0f1e3db34643eb2855dc6d9","2cac9c4cd9570e17450d583d26bb0798399356e7","65e56e3da30720e61bde8d16df8e7ead407a0c70","d599ef290ad020f031a9de3a7089b14f5e599190","1695ff30aa141088a019fc29df6d128d6add06f5","ef47fe340f5b4623fa35aef291a45b5cfcb5d343"],"id":"32d36c8ece10ae7ebd2f3ac6b96b2433927976ac","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/32d36c8ece10ae7ebd2f3ac6b96b2433927976ac","authors":[{"name":"Johannes Wachs","ids":["39963117"]},{"name":"Bálint Daróczy","ids":["1886154"]},{"name":"Anikó Hannák","ids":["46886279"]},{"name":"Katinka Páll","ids":["50744138"]},{"name":"Christoph Riedl","ids":["3381971"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201088"}

Whenever multiple names are used to denote the same thing, owl:sameAs statements are needed in order to link the data and foster reuse. Studies that date back as far as 2009, have observed that the owl:sameAs property is sometimes used incorrectly. In this paper, we show how network metrics such as the community structure of the owl:sameAs graph can be used in order to detect such possibly erroneous statements. One benefit of the here presented approach is that it can be applied to the network of owl:sameAs links itself, and does not rely on any additional knowledge. In order to illustrate its ability to scale, the approach is evaluated on the largest collection of identity links to date, containing over 558M owl:sameAs links scraped from the LOD Cloud.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Detecting Erroneous Identity Links on the Web Using Network Metrics","journalPages":"391-407","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2572/c374da7d6c9db7fed61e0a04d1a2a98b892e.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_23","https://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh/postscript/ISWC2018.pdf"],"entities":["Resource Description Framework","Self-replication","Semantic Web","Sensor","Turing completeness","Web Ontology Language","Web service","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a357b9448d9b2e67f61ee492eee53606477d8c99","faa7c52075c083f8fb352f12104dc3f5c03c2298","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","4a28314d7258c623924641c64a623b47b5428dbc","ddc9939746b01629e27cfb6a09c5f81bfab37cb4","190daeac6a72dbcf315a524a89b544552507055e","7f5a8c4cebd05eb8b503aef7d9e73e87d37c90c3","1ab02a60d7059ff02bf927d31b65914447e67d64","5124aa96978bd3c326208a141e5cb57f1e05c73e","a1671c16a0a772d69a88bd46098fa0e25b7538a3","5934a724ea38e7af3b25203ac439dadc95f1364d","04164b65d8978c055b5fbe8573f033a0ad5a2c6e","190fd3d0784b20743021a2ca3612f0de91ce4acd","312a2edbec5fae34beaf33faa059d37d04cb7235","2af4a96f88ec630c57a28461751af3659ec98dd4","1e3e1a67c5745e74929f9e499ed9577bfc47c233","34bedf5a726f5c8cfadad638263162111035333f","53e96296fa98860138eec65623c7a57b381692ea","552489835e8e6d8911aba937f280fcc7a1956c60","a2ac63a9e807a6d9f94ebf4e11a3adf2560a197c","d7f65fe59a832e9100562ad3d012d2571782c37d","e395cc0089fa8c240496b77a4d4214f98a60404a","d9b3b84b415fbfcd63f2afd6fae9388a51e65e57"],"id":"2572c374da7d6c9db7fed61e0a04d1a2a98b892e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2572c374da7d6c9db7fed61e0a04d1a2a98b892e","authors":[{"name":"Joe Raad","ids":["2404291"]},{"name":"Wouter Beek","ids":["2179513"]},{"name":"Frank van Harmelen","ids":["1725286"]},{"name":"Nathalie Pernelle","ids":["1718164"]},{"name":"Fatiha Saïs","ids":["7291776"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_23"}

To exploit information from both related tasks and related views, a common strategy is to model task relatedness and view consistency separately. The drawback of this strategy is that it did not consider the interactions between tasks and views. To remedy this, we propose a novel method, racBFA, by adding rank constraints to asymmetric bilinear factor analyzers (aBFA). We then adapt racBFA to our MTMV learning problem and design a new MTMV learning algorithm, racMTMV. We evaluated racMTMV on 3 real-world data sets. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Interactions Modeling in Multi-Task Multi-View Learning with Consistent Task Diversity","journalPages":"853-861","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271670"],"entities":["Algorithm","Bilinear filtering","Directive (programming)","Interaction","Loss function","Machine learning","Optimization problem","Program optimization","Rewrite (programming)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0fd474cb9297743daf8cfb9c01f132dfceaea2db","563066b779dff341443cbd8d7e73d92183cf42f4","bc38cfbc45b42886e84e65bd28f2ee34f94a08ac","4e2c7fe486bf6a613b3a573365a98c53b238824e","5098221cf78ba60b5afd26c171da50baf2670996","4280b5e8234ef0fb1df422231dfe3d9c071617de","2d732c3f798954106f53e60d2c804faf23e09f8a","69f9bc2c1e301f76748f2433503e9cba635d4c54","13400fdff75fc0b73652fcdab59e52814022b9b0","d1474776a4fbb81043bc09299dc63a86884691c5","f6295fd69d76d606f66cc15f58767a8161d60335","f464c6f0617d7ff300f3f75f380d0ba4b30f2d25","2f5ae832284c2f9fe2bba449b961745aef817bbf","0e8d3013012025a51128a96c2f15db26a0ac95d3","a5b9206a32f4a3d631d9c10264fb936d1ece3cdc","b40a5f9388448d7054359578285b272d3fbdd24b","2a935bc30179ff2b8a99a736fe7729340284404d","feb9713f4e7614aecdb4778c0bc8c2dced60a325"],"id":"9e13772b18527c21232b26b563a54aa65ad8861e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9e13772b18527c21232b26b563a54aa65ad8861e","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Li","ids":["39738118"]},{"name":"Jun Huan","ids":["2538581"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271670"}

The whole model is learned end-to-end using entity salience labels. The salience model also improves ad hoc search accuracy, providing effective ranking features by modeling the salience of query entities in candidate documents. Our experiments on two entity salience corpora and two TREC ad hoc search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KESM over frequency-based and feature-based methods.

Existing methods only consider intra-type links (e.g., player to player and team to team), but ignore inter-type links (e.g., one type of player to another type of player, such as batsman to bowler and player to team) based on cognitive aspects. They also ignore the spatiality of the players. There is a strong relationship among players and their teams, which can be represented as a network consisting of multi-type interrelated objects. In this paper, we propose a players\u2019 ranking method, called Region-wise Players Link Fusion (RPLF) which is applied to the sport of cricket. RPLF considers players\u2019 region-wise intra-type and inter-type relationbased features to rank the players. Considering multi-type interrelated objects is based on the intuition that a batsman scoring high against top bowlers of a strong team or a bowler taking wickets against top batsmen of a strong team is considered as a good player. The experimental results show that RPLF provides promising insights of players\u2019 rankings. RLFP is a generic method and can be applied to different sports for ranking players. A. Daud, A.

Conventional search engines are powerful at answering open domain queries but are mostly capable of stateless search. In this paper, we define a conversational query as a query that depends on the context of the current conversation, and we formulate the conversational query understanding problem as context-aware query reformulation, where the goal is to reformulate the conversational query into a search engine friendly query in order to satisfy users\u2019 information needs in conversational settings. Such context-aware query reformulation problem lends itself to sequence to sequence modeling. We present a large scale open domain dataset of conversational queries and various sequence to sequence models that are learned from this dataset. The best model correctly reformulates over half of all conversational queries, showing the potential of sequence to sequence modeling for this task.","inCitations":["330c5eaca3bcc4a431cbd57c610f2096055782a1","ff76b79ae2dba7ac8ee2cd9c0324fce03b68bc91","4ea92f2ddbb7ce610c6e80377e61397bad7309ff","336ab175d11e821a5085602ba6d58d67c3ea4e35"],"pmid":"","title":"Conversational Query Understanding Using Sequence to Sequence Modeling","journalPages":"1715-1724","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cab5/fbb2b1c245e1d99542e8ef54e4faf846e3da.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186083","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/www_published_rpsr1234-renA.pdf"],"entities":["Brown Corpus","Deep learning","Entity","Home automation","Information needs","Natural language processing","Paging","Pointer (computer programming)","Stateless protocol","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8ff93cfd37dced279134c9d642337a2085b31f59","fa9890e7fca761f164ab8112e1699154d67bc635","b9d220520a5da7d302107aacfe875b8e2977fdbe","581082bf235f70ea070201839d7b8223a0cbf321","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","5247a6e3a60ff0381355e66bfc313bf27512ae0c","0ddc065cc92046857d35555c3af4ade1310aca4a","2279b6c32509eeb47184c7fa468cae1e84da24eb","de0c30321b22c56d637e7c29cb59180f157272a8","2df630cf3387fe3be404d9642c7fa3fb5ebb08f5","06d51deada6e771a2571807a47dd991120c8dd1a","160ec59f2eb9def5cca00f6c1bf198d13fb8b6a7","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","4685abbbefccf769cc09964c6956638a7bfcf132","55b81991fbb025038d98e8c71acf7dc2b78ee5e9","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","22ca497e24466737981f9ca1690d6c712b7e1276","2a738a4ea894874b408533f3d7452f1e1e1b1ef2","02463e0d580803dca65a48e7fb3d6f407d3d1512","00f31994c123fbceba5d5a0e06bb78aff651aae7","0662db8ec063f14507b43e4f93884c0d0e051d68","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","864b8efebc69c91058023463a126d1f344bbaa8a","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","9886b789ed6120267c1ba27c83fad24178ae7a26","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","1b1df9f75ee6f27433687dad302387f811dab64d","1d2f1af1c0b15c4236c026006a5adaa9a944738a","e2efefbba8bf3e76605db24da0ba15df7b0adc9e","0c49eb69e07339881d71c76ee9c0fec528f0fcf4","289e3e6b84982eb65aea8e3a64f2f6916c98e87e","681387f73200127cce575ebab182f093b63c273b"],"id":"cab5fbb2b1c245e1d99542e8ef54e4faf846e3da","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cab5fbb2b1c245e1d99542e8ef54e4faf846e3da","authors":[{"name":"Gary Ren","ids":["40915255"]},{"name":"Xiaochuan Ni","ids":["2116909"]},{"name":"Manish Malik","ids":["49012616"]},{"name":"Qifa Ke","ids":["2259786"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186083"}

Fueled by the extreme popularity of online social networks and social media, computational social influence has emerged as a subfield of data mining whose goal is to analyze and optimize social influence using computational frameworks such as algorithm design and theoretical modeling. One of the fundamental problems in this field is the problem of influence maximization, primarily motivated by the application of viral marketing. The objective is to identify a small set of users in a social network who, when convinced to adopt a product, shall influence others in the network in a manner that leads to a large number of adoptions.\n In this tutorial, we extensively survey the research on social influence propagation and maximization, with a focus on the recent algorithmic and theoretical advances. To this end, we provide detailed reviews of the latest research effort devoted to (i) improving the efficiency and scalability of the influence maximization algorithms; (ii) context-aware modeling of the influence maximization problem to better capture real-world marketing scenarios; (iii) modeling and learning of real-world social influence; (iv) bridging the gap between social advertising and viral marketing.","inCitations":["56bc2a1eebedab3e452a7ca3969aa1e4dd5946c3","12fbe1cf8312fd88466b78f5021ec17fa2f42bb9","bf0723537ac959d024c4f4cf7e9e72b986189237"],"pmid":"","title":"Influence Maximization in Online Social Networks","journalPages":"775-776","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3162007"],"entities":["Algorithm design","Bridging (networking)","Computation","Computational complexity theory","Data mining","Entropy maximization","Expectation\u2013maximization algorithm","Scalability","Social advertising (social relationships)","Social media","Social network","Software propagation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["618974de0768c4097126cb0a11f48c552b5616f0","084419435227a5bbf54d47ba54e11739756510fd","cb8802e3e37176f757227547f67e713d39a6e6fd","d7c5ace20b07669323611abfbd4c79bc0c9b9a03","5bf9eed67ae1fad166e0170c83b1cae609052882","6ac92c21f94e3cbf1010f93971bf4d05134f1294","199a6cd07857b4127b55f4d54711ed1f38178e90","d7f9c3253552e13f24c3b73bc055ef60388af57c","7ec6c63dc0b12cb7e00122ffe08daf1cbd28cba9","4cd73382dc17561cd276f276c61d5ebf39bf69ad","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","906b86157267fd8e850af3d529ba8fa774bb1ebb","5d6c9843f615fe520a3003349bfefc6f2a85432b","415c6914c0fa3a94244814f1aa9aec5a47cc3f6a","31b10fed7b29aaf9c250ae8ca8b804457b389480","6eb45da9c8582c2e426a4896ff399987b73558b3","76007f3d50f3a7389d09efa97059d0aa52177f72","1282b2a9c054d1ef240bee02af01fddb8848348a","0f02362836413542eef22f94a58315a5432f402c","106c493e5b21b6fad055702ac2c3c39aeaf037af","706c83309fa09454a136d4e607364b27be66172c","6d07996dafc1cb3f20317b17398a058fd62a2683","5cade677d0fffd3f4230e4a65a177a26d86787ba","626596738177fb60858054478bcc7a61f19e3249","2cd56acbc1a8a5677132b3c418543f02fa7c624a","7f51853a1d1d842411c079e802574efcce2debce","ca35349dda2cd85d3c92a72c3351aeadefe53c20","86c639d7db5186ad5e828c1b8a987c98d329a248","abb152802d5b4686a394e221abe951187ea06158","21968ae000669eb4cf03718a0d97e23a6bf75926","f5b1407157cd3e0fda1eaae992acc706bbcccdf3","0a3858df9b27de264f39d774e26e1be50ef28337","20c88e23020ea3c42e640f8ae3dc2a1f8569892d","36c0b81a2ef2505e5c1c763c1abc25cdd72903f2","645d35c8913adcd3540b1efc3af252968384f532","560f3a49aa926dd2670de9c174e616a76fa4cea0","18d458844fd2bac0a6efe54ec4940852f0478a51","048a42699d9991ec18b34bdb484ef244830e1d71","11927f158acdad85251504c158340012ef649b40","521402f4cad16d19c6a7dd43be87569471172602","23d85a0008429845870780c6db3640c05165acaf","712012499829b6bbf9182a8947464e8a50062930","53bd06b86a3e2c510089fdd820e2a07d4d1dabbd","5b58cc07c7d943a7a9270483719c183c0dc8930a","28bf0df09f97e7ef9108e71b45fe1b9a7aa201e2","046f198e11f249556696936a401160c3c90964f7","50ef0cbcc318ec98c7d6132b9c539e9cf41db010","2308df24e9181b34f1c33feff434742cc0146742","21f876b1ee1f637e3d3be08286fa6bbd0d67fc02","f36ff12e87864edcc247768edf84f4884c4330b8","313ca5259607b0b7a6d69230c8dbc3b12f2421d6","15bab2a8c42af2bed7e811fdec7db655f9392bad","4bb0f607c1f6be38ca720ad6913577a778cc2f15","3d84a02dfe4fc904aa729b8b7ca51fd8c97a9dc7","9f0e2198f3e5cfa078fba8be119549d3323e8c8a","8067770f686b8a05ef9e8972864a68dfbbf2256b","b5b59bc2056627ef12942e3946dbc7995dda101f","faee0b8bdf8db97e68980baa8732ec2d4f8cbef5"],"id":"67dc19da49fb853308733413407aacf06333bb44","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/67dc19da49fb853308733413407aacf06333bb44","authors":[{"name":"Çigdem Aslay","ids":["3222408"]},{"name":"Laks V.

One major difficulty in existing gradient-based learning methods is determining proper learning rates, since model convergence would be inaccurate or very slow if the learning rate is too large or too small, respectively. This paper proposes AdaError, an adaptive learning rate method for matrix approximation-based collaborative filtering. AdaError eliminates the need of manually tuning the learning rates by adaptively adjusting the learning rates based on the noisiness level of user-item ratings, using smaller learning rates for noisy ratings so as to reduce their impact on the learned models. Our theoretical and empirical analysis shows that AdaError can improve the generalization performance of the learned models. Experimental studies on the MovieLens and Netflix datasets also demonstrate that AdaError outperforms state-of-the-art adaptive learning rate methods in matrix approximation-based collaborative filtering. Furthermore, by applying AdaError to the standard matrix approximation method, we can achieve statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods in both rating prediction accuracy and top-N recommendation accuracy.","inCitations":["88cf0c7b44ff510d72c79c48080d9067da2970e8"],"pmid":"","title":"AdaError: An Adaptive Learning Rate Method for Matrix Approximation-based Collaborative Filtering","journalPages":"741-751","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c12/6e8f0115d8a7f5b53d526cdd2ca2c4feb198.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186155","http://chenkehan.me/papers/adaerror_www18.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Approximation","Collaborative filtering","MovieLens","Recommender system","Singular value decomposition","Stochastic gradient descent"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1724b33cd5d166d9dab26a61687a1e04e52a86c3","71423bb17133402965a5cbaf31fa28b0366149fd","5262fe8369992259be27165ccd09d1d31c7a4def","49c74d60b17f0f2fe0055b7c1f3a9158b9c76958","d639ba2d4d45666f73960a7c4fc2fe242296152c","8468e655409ccecd5e6ef00446bd87ff05d2fdfb","a9ef2995e8e1bd57a74343073219364811c2ace0","02ff37cd0059cf1af1ecfa62c32304c05ab3bf96","ea29e57670569977f9d00968d89f74b75eb2a799","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","5ac5fbae8a7faf2e9bd49ad01106cec4a2d8f20a","0c0ff60e9d39c203929457d1ac3f840f8c8e9619","adf2f75ea90006059b72b99aad67ee4fc2c7d479","e6f4625a3b2c0999174cdfb23d131e022f8545a0","1bf0ff99cc4af6333c7dc81d65febf34555d9ca7","10dcf6a06c2447433050db1d0985de9fe2a83e5e","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","0122e063ca5f0f9fb9d144d44d41421503252010","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","05aba481e8a221df5d8775a3bb749001e7f2525e","955c52e4d7ac9b8b1c4f1a5a1918bbd9f3c665b6","aeb2510644cee4f5a1c96f1aa184517027f2fe38","bf83f7752751bc1e1892ab79ae3f2af438372a48","cbfcdad2b0c58443113acf80b1830e60164b8016","d3cbb7dfa97c71c33fd69c3138e61dde11645740","4fc5f68d70702c32249f5493153364db35c83c0a","066ebbc6820eb764bcaae0092a30c31f6bf9d76a","3c80a9cc4f9a5f5ea0b458cde677ff8f7b28e797","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","3b0c39b323a8cc1a90b3fdee83dad2fd417bd0ce","6190b8495a8dcc33238dec580f1ecf42c3f2be83","406147c25283a54085d4e74d5a6f0a88be3ab014","21a8d523097e2f19624f93688de22664e41b7a10","160526781a6ece92e424470e79cac5dfde83c0f6","6590de959aa721973f50673244e3250d5ec20a6d","278dda91b8dab71634251d0927dbd52eda6d5626","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","7936aa266de04fb339a7c82eaf508a8a7f2caf80","5fa89d670611f44033598907a5d3c69af9c4ab68","25ad8ad3d1549888a4609659bd55ad825c5df82e","3a0f8961600434d4effdfee87a4325308da2881b","8729441d734782c3ed532a7d2d9611b438c0a09a","64c871cd7e0af7e1aeb94d98c6214eb8d8e8b989"],"id":"7c126e8f0115d8a7f5b53d526cdd2ca2c4feb198","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7c126e8f0115d8a7f5b53d526cdd2ca2c4feb198","authors":[{"name":"Dongsheng Li","ids":["1718853"]},{"name":"Chao Chen","ids":["48240239"]},{"name":"Qin Lv","ids":["2834873"]},{"name":"Hansu Gu","ids":["1759997"]},{"name":"Tun Lu","ids":["1711569"]},{"name":"Li Shang","ids":["1791640"]},{"name":"Ning Gu","ids":["1729673"]},{"name":"Stephen M.

In this task, the goal is to retrieve a contiguous series of sentences (a passage) that concisely addresses the information need expressed in the query. Recent work with deep learning has shown the efficacy of distributed text representations for retrieving sentences or tokens for question answering. However, determining the relevancy of answer passages remains a significant challenge, specifically when there exists a lexical and semantic gap between the text representation used for training and the collection\u2019s vocabulary. In this paper, we demonstrate the flexibility of a character based approach on the task of answer passage retrieval, agnostic to the source of embeddings and with improved performance in P@1 and MRR metrics over a word based approach as the collections degrade in quality.","inCitations":["41182d6ba95a46429d393faa3b856a65a69b5988","f4b96cbeff598f6655ec16bfc754b92fa416df21"],"pmid":"","title":"A Hybrid Embedding Approach to Noisy Answer Passage Retrieval","journalPages":"127-140","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1402/41e956ecb687b2fa1fd8be97c957620d3984.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_10","https://people.cs.umass.edu/~dcohen/data/ecir.pdf"],"entities":["Deep learning","Hoc (programming language)","Information needs","Information retrieval","Lexicon","Long short-term memory","Null character","Question answering","Relevance","Subnetwork","Vocabulary"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0fc13f366f9324d25a1dfa67b1d3e24d8750a297","50b0273575917a0501e3a28d931734828b55fe5b","f15ad28262554b749a6bdcaad5b664e643393c90","7525a935870ea47979e4539edf88da865669bc2e","2e10643c3759f97b673ff8c297778c0b6c20032b","033eb044ef6a865a53878397633876827b7a8f20","100c730003033151c0f78ed1aab23df3e9bd5283","52c161318773dccdb8983162a26e97c0d268b933","38459b78c244ec5a947608e6242881c6e092bb1a","24b4746688c15c8580d1000d4f4ac63f5eb79561","47170ca3d7faa8535229e1fa4766fce0ce30cab2","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","007ab5528b3bd310a80d553cccad4b78dc496b02","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","57c682ac421e67fa3697c75f1b2a2e7b6bd6c292","214adc2dfdc2160cdf5be54001daf2b2304a03b3","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","0af737eae02032e66e035dfed7f853ccb095d6f5","85620fb84ff6788f06a5a8d3b87fbe2b5991a731","99f088540f33d2a5504fee5e2454b54fbe0c0655","5807664af8e63d5207f59fb263c9e7bd3673be79","828dbeb7cf922dc9b6657dd169b8d26d2b58eedb"],"id":"140241e956ecb687b2fa1fd8be97c957620d3984","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/140241e956ecb687b2fa1fd8be97c957620d3984","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Cohen","ids":["2219145"]},{"name":"W.

Although developers have been actively using it since the first beta implementations in 2012, the number of web apps built using Web Audio API cannot yet compare to the number of commercial and open source audio software tools available on native platforms. Many of the sites using this new technology are of an experimental nature or are very limited in their scope. While JavaScript and Web standards are increasingly flexible and powerful, C and C++ are the languages most often used for real-time audio applications and domain specific languages such as FAUST facilitate rapid development with high performance. Our work aims to create a continuum between native and browser based audio app development and to appeal to programmers from both worlds. This paper presents our proposal including guidelines and proof of concept implementations for an open Web Audio plug-in standard essentially the infrastructure to support high level audio plug-ins for the browser.","inCitations":["b83180063e22bb603fda2a7c7d34bcdd677d04b7","e67a1f03f3f356d8644f698989897be4a2571230","59d6443f460d8813a9fbaba6cb70d9ace82b100d"],"pmid":"","title":"Towards an open Web Audio plugin standard","journalPages":"759-766","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fca7/527d01b679c68f33666823b3b79f79150336.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://hal.univ-cotedazur.fr/hal-01721483/file/TowardOpenWebAudioPluginStandardOL-FINAL1.pdf","https://hal.univ-cotedazur.fr/hal-01721483/document","https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3188737"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8389be5320926750d258c7bc7f70f21769402cac","5c7e35ef7b64e2dc8f7409c6420a1a52419df13c","ec8ff78b549112ee9ecec03fb459f094cf6c077e","485908dedcb39a8fe44f76c02e47363f5194f979","a91ea2a689952a89823208dd3c26da8af85c6ecb","1aaf0f11e509f29619384463fa43d9219fbef111","7635f8533a5dddadc4eb4f6e73d216456ba55a39"],"id":"e1ceb545201567bea887f43d5e0985075b4dfdff","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1ceb545201567bea887f43d5e0985075b4dfdff","authors":[{"name":"Michel Buffa","ids":["1835808"]},{"name":"Jérôme Lebrun","ids":["2154468"]},{"name":"Jari Kleimola","ids":["2705313"]},{"name":"Oliver Larkin","ids":["2485686"]},{"name":"Stéphane Letz","ids":["3248286"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3188737"}

Data is exploited by WoT applications to monitor healthcare or even control home automation devices. The purpose of the Knowledge Extraction for the Web of Things (KE4WoT) challenge2 is to automatically extract the relevant knowledge from already designed smart WoT applications in various applicative domains. Those applications design and release Knowledge Bases (e.g., datasets and/or models) on the web. Standardizations have a growing interest in designing models to represent devices and generated data.W3C Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) [3] is the first initiative to address interoperability issues to describe sensor networks through an ontology. Sensors and devices are required to build WoT applications. The last release of the SSN ontology3 became a W3C recommendation in October 2017. It is a joint contribution with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard, extending and improving the SSN ontology published in 2011. W3CWeb of Things (WoT) Interest Group is designing a vocabulary to describe interactions between objects through the Web, a potential implementation is the WoT ontology4. A \"Remote health monitoring system\"5 scenario has been designed among several use cases.OneM2M, an international standard for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) designed the OneM2M ontology6. OneM2M extends the European ETSI M2M standard.

There are two key processes in dynamic networks: network structural evolution and network temporal evolution, where the former represents interdependency between entities and their neighbors in the network at each timestamp, while the latter captures the evolving behavior of the entire network from the current timestamp to the next. Structural evolution generally assumes that a node is more likely to co-evolve with its neighbors in the near future. Temporal evolution focuses on the trend of network evolution as a whole, based on the accumulation of historical data. It is thus essential to use characteristics of both structural and temporal evolutions to emulate complex behaviors of dynamic networks. However, very few existing work considered both processes. In addition, real-life networks are often very sparse with limited observed links. A missing link between two nodes does not always imply that the two nodes do not have a relation in reality, especially when they share many common neighbors. Most existing methods only focus on the first-order proximity of networks, which is usually insufficient to capture the relationships among nodes. \n In this work, we propose a novel framework named STEP, to simultaneously integrate both structural and temporal information in link prediction in dynamic networks. STEP first constructs a sequence of higher-order proximity matrices to better capture the implicit relationships among nodes. A regularized optimization problem is then formulated to model those higher-order proximity matrices along with additional structural and temporal constraints. Given the large scale of modern networks, we also develop an efficient block coordinate gradient descent approach to solve the optimization problem efficiently. STEP can be used to solve the link prediction problem in directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted dynamic networks. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets demonstrate that STEP can effectively model link propagation over entire time-varying networks and its superiority over some state-of-the-art algorithms.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Exploiting Structural and Temporal Evolution in Dynamic Link Prediction","journalPages":"427-436","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271740"],"entities":["Algorithm","Bioinformatics","Cyber-physical system","Dynamic-link library","Entity","Evolution","Experiment","First-order predicate","Gradient descent","Graph (discrete mathematics)","IBM Notes","ISO 10303","Interdependence","List of Code Lyoko episodes","Mathematical optimization","Optimization problem","Protein structure prediction","Real life","Scalability","Social network","Software propagation","Sparse matrix","Time-varying network","Tree accumulation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","ce2fd2b302989be27095d4f988686fceab93c6a0","2e37d6b9a02ec31ea22252c37beae410c6b609a8","bcf48b5e76c7e22335c6820f0de0abe8c5f708b5","3f1f762b2b6750f2feb1ca2e021b2a3e798774a1","10ac4bc35c4fcdc09bebbd3b46e3a1223993b894","c90dd7731b01b3b486b5a28e1ce9bec547c9cfab","96544d4857777682129280b9d934d6ff2f221f40","5c58ad9a6c09782814a7d048bebd6ef1609c0fb4","4bc6ba5052654772c92c6007968964f64e4de1cc","f8a26c822984681075491ee6601a66e6675d0e63","1edd8d421dbd661281b823c3c873d8b445c82b5f","5ea4c598a154f6f0498d01a420bcca54285eb92f","5d3a0eba8e82853c28e315003e131811ebd18143","047699afd803d695f482277cbd6a10fef4b6c6c8","8a634a82681897822b14de28849c6548346206a0","c22bdeb25d1e217ee2927f689b0f3205181f1430","1f648792e09b175d97ff9348e5ecd1f806650038","39348c10c90be968357e2a6b65d5e0e479307735","04080a4fc2cb3316d63e9f6e8161873be21f6637","2d59ab3e29f99c25be24cdb5190d58fe2be7f855","34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","0d986240f345223dc542233074775d7f869a4013","c924797dad40d6a567fc3c8f12d403ce984a6193","c2fd72cb2a77941e655b5d949d0d59b01e173c3b","0d56addb8ed4888d976c34d8e0c287d8e5838545","315d843eef331a40ba422dc1f7aea4a7e14531a7","68151343db72713c87f646546d12c84306109643","0c8a049baf1e4d1f82a1b434fa70283733ac1688","0f8f6c2e8c41b835407ba4b07d48944252a41400","0710099aee18aabc0605c52628c29ac5ad94ec60","98e3766f786dfb3982733a95aa7b1e142e7612b0","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","37b269a8c86b75d3b19c8390548c678d9f102d15","2d896f30d9412161e330dcbe013ea1faa059fa02"],"id":"33841403bb8676b462a30707754fac09b312165f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/33841403bb8676b462a30707754fac09b312165f","authors":[{"name":"Huiyuan Chen","ids":["4760974"]},{"name":"Jing Li","ids":["1723081"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271740"}

While different factors determine how a Linked Data generation algorithm is designed, potential alternatives for each factor are currently not considered when designing the tools\u2019 underlying algorithms. Certain design patterns are frequently applied across different tools, covering certain alternatives of a few of these factors, whereas other alternatives are never explored. Consequently, there are no adequate tools for Linked Data generation for certain occasions, or tools with inadequate and inefficient algorithms are chosen. In this position paper, we determine such factors, based on our experiences, and present a preliminary list. These factors could be considered when a Linked Data generation algorithm is designed or a tool is chosen. We investigated which factors are covered by widely known Linked Data generation tools and concluded that only certain design patterns are frequently encountered. By these means, we aim to point out that Linked Data generation is above and beyond bare implementations, and algorithms need to be thoroughly and systematically studied and exploited.","inCitations":["6661e65676d986aca487dd6d2ed72eb5369c291b","4b0f47a9bc730d8e7736498afef93f1d7eeda529"],"pmid":"","title":"What Factors Influence the Design of a Linked Data Generation Algorithm?","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6943/ff9b25fddcf19d4f7733700359660632ee33.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2018/papers/LDOW2018_paper_12.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2073/article-08.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Design pattern","Linked data","Space: Above and Beyond"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6b23b81b1a9ef6aeaef872ca322b8f06ff2932b6","f5241514a73ce4630d46b9ccfd6d3e6569c1f8cf","5982babd2c39cd0013c98801a76e3b8cbbf6fec2","2bfeae16b50688ed3f2c0554fcfed98cf7624efb","26d6f9a60e4dee8f752c5164b88b884fe40f472e","2083c16e848c8e3db77418b170488b49c8e52119","6602c9cbaa70cb3807445088b2fa9bd73813d982","1b5b374c10a553cc19bf59a51a09159b8d0e20d3","09c1b69ab0fe1315b0d5e5e0b0853585c4a319b5"],"id":"6943ff9b25fddcf19d4f7733700359660632ee33","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6943ff9b25fddcf19d4f7733700359660632ee33","authors":[{"name":"Anastasia Dimou","ids":["1722023"]},{"name":"Pieter Heyvaert","ids":["1896690"]},{"name":"Ben De Meester","ids":["2959801"]},{"name":"Ruben Verborgh","ids":["1723397"]}],"doi":""}

Among different spam types, a less explored area is OSN abuse that leverages the telephony channel to defraud users. Phone numbers are advertized via OSNs, and users are tricked into calling these numbers. To expand the reach of such scam / spam campaigns, phone numbers are advertised across multiple platforms like Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus, Flickr, and YouTube. In this paper, we present the first data-driven characterization of cross-platform campaigns that use multiple OSN platforms to reach their victims and use phone numbers for monetization. We collect -23M posts containing -1.8M unique phone numbers from Twitter, Facebook, GooglePlus, Youtube, and Flickr over a period of six months. Clustering these posts helps us identify 202 campaigns operating across the globe with Indonesia, United States, India, and United Arab Emirates being the most prominent originators. We find that even though Indonesian campaigns generate highest volume (-3.2M posts), only 1.6% of the accounts propagating Indonesian campaigns have been suspended so far. By examining campaigns running across multiple OSNs, we discover that Twitter detects and suspends -93% more accounts than Facebook. Therefore, sharing intelligence about abuse-related user accounts across OSNs can aid in spam detection. According to our dataset, around -35K victims and -$8.8M could have been saved if intelligence was shared across the OSNs. By analyzing phone number based spam campaigns running on OSNs, we highlight the unexplored variety of phone-based attacks surfacing on OSNs.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Under the Shadow of Sunshine: Characterizing Spam Campaigns Abusing Phone Numbers Across Online Social Networks","journalPages":"67-76","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201065","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00451v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00451"],"entities":["Anti-spam techniques","Ecosystem","Flickr","Google+","Interaction","Interactive voice response","Internet","Monetization","Regular expression","Spamming","Technical support","Telephone number","User (computing)","Video post-processing","WhatsApp Messenger"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0088523c4bf74b35c2e7471e740d6758ab36f7b9","8bd49ae102ccc62617d59c4b25531972d7be3b15","8dcd85df8268ee1ef4e59478b971b469c98a85bd","358843af3655391738c8435fc8a74eb49170e8ea","48ae5520e6a49dbb87d9c8f895c625e106474dc4","b154120ad4050668e1cbe337e6a2b32f29bcfd28","7302c34adfe86ebb2868f583e686421c9ddfdee3","028559e1c172fd41a5d656365172664d8269c9a5","214615f9c8d45da7c622e27a9ccac03c76035e4e","cc88ed7fee917555f13be25c6e6e60380a15ecee","6c2133b200e3b2e6d1d0d96d0b6dad22dc2bb779","6470930ff36cde541c837bedcf17c20490fedbbc","a5ce1a22c2c824f5151a08c4c0a5e42fe5eb7fab","424536ddab83337b6fed7ddebb32a3c4db30c8a8","32d16e35ac8801cf39a6a996429780d8c1a695fd","1fa86215010b27242700c6bd2e28853b1109fce2","78fe22f77eb45808bf50b2a1c22f3112aea88438","050f284ac0c00668f9f6a0882e545589b4012f56","383f1f2ceb32557690b6a0abf6aab48cb98552ff","7ce176ed696a5d31f42c8e0c3f593f3232b37119","9b5478a7a9188ccf34a5375efac9991e2cbec4c3","393ed20364b4be9f0ec4e8978e4b5c8e384aa2cf","d2e47b04b4dd88397d5a19db27ba6a0aa5d1317e","572009f92181ee5a7363dd5d42ac591ec523dea6","242ad6bf9d1c98643c7eb2276f969b1f344ca283","4f6487d61ba6c2afa44be0e870599bb292e27638","37092f9c79cb6220fd6f01882e9e3c1b41d0750e","2830246be09bbd376cd7f2ed9ae150110dcb08cf","5d07aedddee14b69efd0803aebdf1d5d19d2b657","1dd5355e62b9fc37a355e135d5909ed28128d653","169ba9e7cdf9d5d58e585890a9683975d7ec26c0","2f6ddce704d2daadb088cc03bec714bdb00b4f2a"],"id":"28526f972d1640e8cad22d42e29f5e70473a368e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/28526f972d1640e8cad22d42e29f5e70473a368e","authors":[{"name":"Srishti Gupta","ids":["46414949"]},{"name":"Dhruv Kuchhal","ids":["40845434"]},{"name":"Payas Gupta","ids":["2017454"]},{"name":"Mustaque Ahamad","ids":["1710123"]},{"name":"Manish Gupta","ids":["29960724"]},{"name":"Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","ids":["1734731"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201065"}

Various approaches for incremental processing of queries have been proposed over the years. Traditional approaches rely on updating the results of a query when updates are streamed rather than re-computing these queries, and therefore, higher execution performance is expected. However, they do not perform well for large databases that are updated at high frequencies. Therefore, new algorithms and approaches have been proposed in the literature to address these challenges by, for instance, reducing the complexity of processing updates. Moreover, many of these algorithms are now leveraging distributed streaming platforms such as Spark Streaming and Flink. In this tutorial, we briefly discuss legacy approaches for incremental query processing, and then give an overview of the new challenges introduced due to processing big data streams. We then discuss in detail the recently proposed algorithms that address some of these challenges. We emphasize the characteristics and algorithmic analysis of various proposed approaches and conclude by discussing future research directions.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Incremental Techniques for Large-Scale Dynamic Query Processing","journalPages":"2297-2298","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3274271","http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/dan.olteanu/papers/ekov-cikm18.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Big data","Database","Streaming media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["efbde7aeccd0777537663a775c0fe9a02acae736","25ac757c975185450da0b49530df3c1471ebc6b0","bdd53046694e8ac114e9be19b651c4b103801954","006ca7d3571497c73062b67ab1ab20a4b09b0972","0456a5c3b2001465d05e84ce6786ef200184de65","1d1e5f116203d7861942995ce9037043a68e4c02","42b07dc48b94cb56f8fe82c30d3f3b6dc71bb9e5","086a7b955f243917c8ea3ed7be29b5aca60bd34f","b0a064eb9437ba23b13c6886bf6a0ba49d6d31d5","0558c94a094158ecd64f0d5014d3d9668054fb97","2fc3352487b971ff483c3988a3b2d67182e483ea","3179afdd19a6051a947080fb7c995ff919463da8","09fc759da304c72eeed17f4b45c5c516c863805a","059eb34d95c73e37dca8e35b0ac5a2fb0142f3ee","39a03fbebf4e0c064bfae795083a6124ae93bbce","d29f2dbb39936e9be8e32421919d48b7601c4ee7","3ce3c4d153595b4d377f6de27fb7d7bec651b788","0541d5338adc48276b3b8cd3a141d799e2d40150","e847c3ec130da57328db79a7fea794b07dbccdd9","4e7f68aeea4c933eb8b4ea1f41f39de15e8a755c","f5df61effe8047eb9ea1702cfcc268dbba678567","1fe41b1240a0eddec736b675e914b4858a955876"],"id":"b2ed3c8dd896d366762f7b05acea6c69b27d8026","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b2ed3c8dd896d366762f7b05acea6c69b27d8026","authors":[{"name":"Iman Elghandour","ids":["3258627"]},{"name":"Ahmet Kara","ids":["49160935"]},{"name":"Dan Olteanu","ids":["1756801"]},{"name":"Stijn Vansummeren","ids":["1709642"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3274271"}

In this paper, we use machine learning methods to predict these Discourse Segment Types in a corpus of biomedical research papers. The initial experiment used features related to verb type and form, obtaining F-scores ranging from 0.41-0.65. To improve our results, we explored a variety of methods for balancing classes, before applying classification algorithms. We also performed an ablation study and stepwise approach for feature selection. Through these feature selection processes, we were able to reduce our 37 features to the 7 most informative ones, while maintaining F1 scores in the range of 0.630.65. Next, we performed an experiment with a reduced set of target classes. Using only verb tense features, logistic regression, a decision tree classifier and a random forest classifier, we predicted that a segment type was either a Result/Method or a Fact/Implication, with F1 scores above 0.8. Interestingly, findings from this machine learning approach are in line with a reader experiment, which found a correlation between verb tense and a biomedical reader\u2019s interpretation of discourse segment type. This suggests that experimental and concept-centric discourse in biology texts can be distinguished by humans or machines, using verb tense as a key feature.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Optimized Machine Learning Methods Predict Discourse Segment Type in Biological Research Articles","journalPages":"95-109","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/03b3/2428973d98a1a12862555976aaa0e4360ae4.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://save-sd.github.io/2018/accepted/cox/index.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01379-0_7"],"entities":["Algorithm","Decision tree","Feature selection","Information","Logistic regression","Machine learning","Random forest","Stepwise regression"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0694efbf7ee97bdc9878cdedeaec3afdf0c86986","7518c0b45ec68077502d5c461661a52ba1a3efe3","0eb349c49ee5718945f70d619a023531930ad1f3","18bc1d4271abe8dd6e16179cdb06524a4f396e16","f43d062bcc16b33b45ffef11d2d8a4db9defbd50","e29cfe765c0e768d50c9cd4557fb7c2c53cbadb7"],"id":"03b32428973d98a1a12862555976aaa0e4360ae4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03b32428973d98a1a12862555976aaa0e4360ae4","authors":[{"name":"J.

The cause of this strong impulse in this area of research is certainly to be attributed to the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) activations as features and their outstanding performance. However, practically all the available image retrieval systems are implemented in main memory, limiting their applicability and preventing their usage in big-data applications. In this paper, we propose to transform CNN features into textual representations and index them with the well-known full-text retrieval engine Elasticsearch. We validate our approach on a novel CNN feature, namely Regional Maximum Activations of Convolutions. A preliminary experimental evaluation, conducted on the standard benchmark INRIA Holidays, shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach and how it compares to state-of-the-art main-memory indexes.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Large-Scale Image Retrieval with Elasticsearch","journalPages":"925-928","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210089"],"entities":["Archive","Artificial neural network","Auxiliary memory","Benchmark (computing)","Big data","Computer data storage","Content-based image retrieval","Convolution","Convolutional neural network","Document retrieval","Elasticsearch","Feature vector","Information","Preprocessor","Scalability","Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["54e517f042df7f1566046061ac303089715e1771","5c3dce55c61ee86073575ac75cc882a215cb49e6","2cbb8de53759e75411bc528518947a3094fbce3a","4748d22348e72e6e06c2476486afddbc76e5eca7","127316fbe268c78c519ceb23d41100e86639418a","009fba8df6bbca155d9e070a9bd8d0959bc693c2","33da83b54410af11d0cd18fd07c74e1a99f67e84","ff293f1db0d6360975853c7f2ce5e4196663b2d6","abb3df5b61dc7550db96fc112f98fb99a9db8c93","4daf898d78ed64c990b99ebf04f84380d7fedb84","b100d2374ef5a202c320061bc259c15f43b71b48","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","3c54e5aeef42b685f591390d5ae5c813539ccac3","5ea18f4f13835ea3413646ed676cdff411ff0c75","09a35fbc5d0a002102a00dad3cf16b67f7d6d694","398188a4fded6b6288dbb213f8659a6d2bf48dda"],"id":"16f83d698893e80d303d0df60c72c9827371915f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/16f83d698893e80d303d0df60c72c9827371915f","authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Amato","ids":["35829050"]},{"name":"Paolo Bolettieri","ids":["1982596"]},{"name":"Fabio Carrara","ids":["1996072"]},{"name":"Fabrizio Falchi","ids":["1846129"]},{"name":"Claudio Gennaro","ids":["2209975"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210089"}

Classification of social media content is a fundamental task for social media mining, and most existing methods regard it as a text categorization problem and mainly focus on using content features, such as words and hashtags. However, for many emerging applications like fake news and rumor detection, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features from content. For example, intentional spreaders of fake news may manipulate the content to make it look like real news. To address this problem, this paper concentrates on modeling the propagation of messages in a social network. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, TraceMiner, to (1) infer embeddings of social media users with social network structures; and (2) utilize an LSTM-RNN to represent and classify propagation pathways of a message. Since content information is sparse and noisy on social media, adopting TraceMiner allows to provide a high degree of classification accuracy even in the absence of content information. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on the task of fake news detection and news categorization.","inCitations":["3c527cd9e2c9602de5276c5890326bdeadb34890","627d5471b580bd598c62136b1023b60535b4fac0","d1234bc63fae2840b7e4b3d6956665d5f96beaf9","9635a88dfbe3e6758923260a1429813f94a3e032","16b22d9e92b1ce80906f831c9f6222d9794d7089","334b86c9a3c4bda5f1a127dfe72be72796f2364d","81118752b41d8249bf2db8c80141c922cb97d1e8","eff57ffb739564a8c2b8996908a481c921d90f29","82c8c26193ab19ec569713f3bda2bd5daaa8d29d","e6009df23a51f69fe067d5aeb1e5955bf0d370a5","107b12c5c69bcd8e3d459066b424d04a2b12025f","06b96ccf6847ed04561a437c76d54057a672d231"],"pmid":"","title":"Tracing Fake-News Footprints: Characterizing Social Media Messages by How They Propagate","journalPages":"637-645","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159677","http://www.public.asu.edu/~liangwu1/WSDM18_TraceMiner.pdf"],"entities":["Categorization","Document classification","End-to-end principle","Hashtag","Long short-term memory","Random neural network","Social media mining","Social network","Software propagation","Sparse matrix","Tracing (software)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["26bc9195c6343e4d7f434dd65b4ad67efe2be27a","84d3018ef66a230d34471dc663925d54ffa7d2d0","df787a974fff59f557ed1ec620fc345568aec491","139f4aad228c43e095808b7b24eeb634c9da58f0","d96dc4b05cd571a7481f0d3fb5f4842b0f05ce4a","a2aae7232ad516e6ad356c10ce20956f2e9380bc","231d0ecb5a33eae8495f646a985cc14e209fbfb2","bb8a5fe720c9e2f6fb6797d3ad3f99c0971d200b","3473851d23eb7f6271e288ccbd8b2952cad4e293","c0a21fb656664a8b82844a2777b24116ee0e9087","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","2e37d6b9a02ec31ea22252c37beae410c6b609a8","8ccd0adb1a00358ede79f1d9bdcce472dc1cb8d4","063ac7f23c65bd97633d4f6bf4c31eb70879aa7c","a44e3f9a76ffa530bd87a6eb7c72025b8ebe6e71","47dd6b9d9cedbe2526ad22a01ca4fea1025e07d1","6537b1603643da7d5c516e41b9231e7b3898938a","665c6e93c3777a33598b04d47eea87028f755bab","0dd8ce441c90280637d6d2b6df24747a0ff6ae11","34fb7a03092e8bb393a8d0fcfdd56f3c5a171c49","cb40a5e6d4fc0290452345791bb91040aed76961","0f0809e6537e5ffe212190c243a249382f5ffab1","736e8deabcae7e2f9eb6c41a1bfae1b5270a8dbd","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","8cf627f8e6afa66336c75ccbb2b0130bc6f5e893","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","2c863569e7e179ae660cd7b4ab2541a24b8f619a","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","22ae02d81c21cb90b0de071550cfb99e6a623e62","1471511609f7185544703f0e22777a64c6681f38","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","ca7fbbfb4f701df71c0e2b4aedb4f9b1d1574aac","8c49cb0a20e772c5b7aefa6a64385a3ec55ca8aa","6519dae1a65a0ec19d2a446c33cb9bb0bc922bb0","53b1054815a6eb0a6c483cb1da4d2411f4da4ec0"],"id":"b9417d287d6d9cc34c5d65c5380ccca1e76ec63d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b9417d287d6d9cc34c5d65c5380ccca1e76ec63d","authors":[{"name":"Liang Wu","ids":["47767581"]},{"name":"Huan Liu","ids":["38746648"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159677"}

It aims to use one type of data as query and retrieve results of another type. For different modality data, how to reduce their heterogeneous property and preserve their local relationship are two main challenges. In this paper, we present a novel joint dictionary learning and semantic constrained latent subspace learning method for cross-modal retrieval~(JDSLC) to deal with above two issues. In this unified framework, samples from different modalities are encoded by their corresponding dictionaries to reduce the semantic gap. In the meantime, we learn modality-specific projection matrices to map the sparse coefficients into the shared latent subspace. Meanwhile, we impose a novel cross-modal similarity constraint to make the representations of samples that belong to same class but from different modalities as close as possible in the latent subspace. An efficient algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the proposed model and learn the optimal dictionary, coefficients and projection matrix for each modality.

Therefore, tools for investigating rumor news have become an urgent necessity. One useful function of such tools is to see ways a specific topic or event is represented by presenting different points of view from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose Maester, a novel agreement-aware search framework for investigating rumor news. Given an investigative question, Maester will retrieve related articles to that question, assign and display top articles from agree, disagree, and discuss categories to users. Splitting the results into these three categories provides the user a holistic view towards the investigative question. We build Maester based on the following two key observations: (1) relatedness can commonly be determined by keywords and entities occurring in both questions and articles, and (2) the level of agreement between the investigative question and the related news article can often be decided by a few key sentences. Accordingly, we use gradient boosting tree models with keyword/entity matching features for relatedness detection, and leverage recurrent neural network to infer the level of agreement. Our experiments on the Fake News Challenge (FNC) dataset demonstrate up to an order of magnitude improvement of Maester over the original FNC winning solution, for agreement-aware search.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Investigating Rumor News Using Agreement-Aware Search","journalPages":"2117-2125","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07398","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1802.07398","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07398v2.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272020","http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/cikm18_jshang.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Authorization","Best practice","Big data","Entity","Experiment","Gradient boosting","Ground truth","Holism","Internet Information Services","Recurrent neural network","Source-to-source compiler"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27e5b014053b38d390eea8276f13c6db5bc26437","26bc9195c6343e4d7f434dd65b4ad67efe2be27a","98853ff625b08f941d5b0c0be0c6ec73b2344fdd","8cc114ff0b9266bc7166543acd77de22865c89c9","88a38d820a4dde01111112263ea1db5db97d0ab7","ded1fa5432e066c3a9f998bd52c6ed736068c582","9103b7efcb53c5774d20f079f604c699088c6814","5973cbe8174a80a2c57c0f8100d6e701f3d12cf2","6afbba82086b9869a29c02d20c3e6948cbd04927","4a0cce17ae9ba7615f450803c8fc6255a78f191e","4954fa180728932959997a4768411ff9136aac81","0ec57ff75062a6e557998079578587efc869e105","12db83e66e50152e170d5009c425c925ad2e2c2a","0788fb1109b1db8c72776005c9c0af926a278017","8b23d7d90348281a391f1f61f9032bdd051024f3","24f896e584033e5aa9a20327e25de1f387c3f430","77c891fb78071c3a5ea307741d99a2cb21d42803","596c882de006e4bb4a93f1fa08a5dd467bee060a","663052d2941da1514fdfa5073232153f57ce86fb","42771aede47980ae8eeebac246c7a8b941d11414","d16b75ab2c4c5560212cea1eb9633abedfeaf4c5","0b7ec645545f4bd58d8e249d034ef177c55a076e"],"id":"48b7c53d80719917b7dc38189b7e22a2f8836503","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/48b7c53d80719917b7dc38189b7e22a2f8836503","authors":[{"name":"Jingbo Shang","ids":["2884976"]},{"name":"Jiaming Shen","ids":["3363642"]},{"name":"Tianhang Sun","ids":["35524838"]},{"name":"Xingbang Liu","ids":["30575502"]},{"name":"Anja Gruenheid","ids":["3202556"]},{"name":"Flip Korn","ids":["2096611"]},{"name":"Ádám Dániel Lelkes","ids":["2846087"]},{"name":"Cong Yu","ids":["46756318"]},{"name":"Jiawei Han","ids":["1722175"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3272020"}

However, such algorithms usually assume a stationary reward distribution, which hardly holds in practice as users' preferences are dynamic. This inevitably costs a recommender system consistent suboptimal performance. In this paper, we consider the situation where the underlying distribution of reward remains unchanged over (possibly short) epochs and shifts at unknown time instants. In accordance, we propose a contextual bandit algorithm that detects possible changes of environment based on its reward estimation confidence and updates its arm selection strategy respectively. Rigorous upper regret bound analysis of the proposed algorithm demonstrates its learning effectiveness in such a non-trivial environment. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets for recommendation confirm its practical utility in a changing environment.","inCitations":["1a8192f0476084c6033b87fc059e585302145eef","0a1af3a8698a4a1028cfa98b6a3acc1804255c70"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning Contextual Bandits in a Non-stationary Environment","journalPages":"495-504","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09365","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09365v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210051"],"entities":["Algorithm","Display advertising","Epoch (reference date)","Multi-armed bandit","Recommender system","Regret (decision theory)","Stationary process","Synthetic intelligence"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["07c45ee71fef4015ca1e90e4750d59f7c2a40831","e33f3fd9e6f02ea56eacf20e9e8119abc608546c","18aec6e4dd84c0617856704c89b6ab27b197192c","114a6b4220ba12842a3845a2e39cf50a664c5bb0","11465688b3e2ce4ac0208c6f016861973ffaab6e","0052029755e1056c8eb85ef20c684b250849b0c3","02d1105bec3877ed8cd2d28f76b67ae8ba3f2331","58ce151c8435ddef8d4667b32d29d115dbc3c24e","5d06b0b24f42fa7f48b01267458baf5e6e7e9fc0","88e271cfc3ca9d4db09a0f29d4a2568246cab0ef","361f5c406f71d56e18450ffe0c095e9d49badfe4","035bd1607d664b0c10143ca055f1c645b7d04a11","315fa6e960d244a722a42ae5f0bdf48303e2c831","1b3c86ad6c149941750d97bd72b6b0122c1d8b5e","34bbf2a8e32b6a97feb0ce23308f8bab300916c7","43f296d5fa2101433417b7a0a514eb852893d5af","336cc6866437a424448db5c358f03e3561274c29","582e6586e1ec20baa8df804fab8c061728a66a71","1e3813d2ae58d5b2ee63c2e5e8554ad7f5b9a4f5","7ed04e8ca2217ce1906864a6a64e6153afbab132","f066fa9e9f999fb81da2cfbecdee898d21b3413b","103f6fe35033f9327611ddafde74a2b544072980","253254f518631ab21cad201f3448b48e385eff28","ec15c6150d823642ef4f33039f2235127ae2b24f"],"id":"5aed10a3b93065d29e6ae41631d5e953590b811d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5aed10a3b93065d29e6ae41631d5e953590b811d","authors":[{"name":"Qingyun Wu","ids":["3430897"]},{"name":"Naveen Iyer","ids":["32774943"]},{"name":"Hongning Wang","ids":["31825390"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210051"}

In this paper, we consider point-to-point requests that come with source-destination pairs and release-time constraints that restrict when each request can be served. The pointto-point requests and release-time constraints model taxi rides and deliveries. For all the variants considered, we show constant-factor approximation algorithms based on a linear programming framework. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first set of results for the aforementioned variants of the minimum latency problems. Furthermore, we provide an empirical study of heuristics based on our theoretical algorithms on a real data set of taxi rides.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Minimizing Latency in Online Ride and Delivery Services","journalPages":"379-388","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bac1/0b3fd88db6c4b95c82e9203a7b2b2e0b5a67.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02744v1.pdf","https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/eadcff02e97370e8299147869e5548d7158d2c03.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186104","http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02744"],"entities":["APX","Approximation algorithm","Heuristic (computer science)","Interrupt latency","Linear programming","Point-to-Point Protocol"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0249fe341657119e86821c13ad1dec45ea622b16","41c79702e2b2a0f10ade8c9157a531e796c46900","cbee86df869001017dc5142929ed6d5ff2f8a994","517aa46c059dee3d1d7060d9a5f82194addb262a","94f9c72cdafa345b440a0ed1f0a65bcef7f77929","f4edb93049aa838bed9f6d2eddadf07d01420659","f4d1c8afbe431975e4e5b885b47a9471608f5026","f6ffca07d5e778eaa87bd0a2c975149f41b32eae","8d6eac50e83c2bd0ac68011be94d80b1534250f8","ce55ee5b8ff9cf79798debbcacb893185efd8989","40eeb590ab369ce707e1326854c025f025c7a74a","c9a29d7eb349a1a91acb906d5c437dd6576591ec","db3e183daafcc7a5e2131d6701f76127a317211b","2256df5c4f5dc2edc31550275646200f7b6d8c94","cf0185df2bfb576ead235179cf89130bb62ebbba","97ade83f8d1fdce04b0d73816bc7175258560ff0","0e7acfdb083d16611bcd67ded757e011d7b1a0c3","743e585b9e9c3a893b44824dbdddbc2ac1f501e3","0024b84ce6ebb4db08c53efbbaba7fdc3d9fc552","6257124cc459ae870cea878d6de8860a449afc29","043e42d0f930c7da214b6adf2b691accb045a869","4772c50bf12df3d12668d608caad8310151d1f75","a1e10c88135e31a685697960b8c7952e576605fd","b1f799b6eee7eb76df33f4d027665f86e884237a","fd69c56a728b4642544cad1f4bd7271ec2ad4875","f5e77672c95028f4ac116cd96bbc9776ab0942b1","56ce26f792abe4704993a3302688e52df28fe2be","6f488d642ac789218005b79562cfa0f622f9d2ce","dfdb3be95b742a6a44fcae89b5f771441d12349f","8bef5a8f26ecfb4f40f82c4943c43141a786edc6","78b4271480ba3b143022773b9e9b5e2342db41dc"],"id":"41f5781c73d7237b343a0889d993c71d266e55f3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/41f5781c73d7237b343a0889d993c71d266e55f3","authors":[{"name":"Abhimanyu Das","ids":["2512591"]},{"name":"Sreenivas Gollapudi","ids":["4958631"]},{"name":"Anthony Kim","ids":["50553437"]},{"name":"Debmalya Panigrahi","ids":["1715972"]},{"name":"Chaitanya Swamy","ids":["1762571"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186104"}

Retrieval-based conversation models have the advantages of returning fluent and informative responses. Most existing studies in this area are on open domain ''chit-chat'' conversations or task / transaction oriented conversations. More research is needed for information-seeking conversations. There is also a lack of modeling external knowledge beyond the dialog utterances among current conversational models. In this paper, we propose a learning framework on the top of deep neural matching networks that leverages external knowledge for response ranking in information-seeking conversation systems. We incorporate external knowledge into deep neural models with pseudo-relevance feedback and QA correspondence knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments with three information-seeking conversation data sets including both open benchmarks and commercial data show that, our methods outperform various baseline methods including several deep text matching models and the state-of-the-art method on response selection in multi-turn conversations. We also perform analysis over different response types, model variations and ranking examples. Our models and research findings provide new insights on how to utilize external knowledge with deep neural models for response selection and have implications for the design of the next generation of information-seeking conversation systems.","inCitations":["3ae5bef6b0c8317603a2deab2527383580904fd8","8ecaff11e660cc225f390b1a07fe5c1918c9d4af"],"pmid":"","title":"Response Ranking with Deep Matching Networks and External Knowledge in Information-seeking Conversation Systems","journalPages":"245-254","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00188v3.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210011","http://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1304","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00188","http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00188"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b44ff5104557fc9b900d48f02605dd42d794927d","511e040ba116ced7517475dd21d7ebd0ac96bf8d","e416a86418a86b1c5bffb690e4b70583e9401422","52e011e52d1a9e2c9ea12f31f5a2d3c1b459017e","685752c0563023d40f96d34a1c6f9d042587a5d6","2fea79706d001494573f4b416463de9597ebb465","158f9e4e385645d2db3949483789cc84ceb41c3c","7477d88b225909ef645941a0142eed75dc3b2e56","303eef410700063913f9e6ad349a0830dbccefb8","eb74d7539d25e415a12e1159a7d0300e505f2b73","11c0d36b008980eb03ef0802bba305c089726cac","234dc7984668f72ee4917755915040386be4eb1f","02121b35aa2c543e6afbd193afb9c929705b7aee","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","a6eec00f10346ce27d4f69f9e38f5665fffe8056","06e7ba45e4def91c280360791031f2b24d9898e5","3e2529cf0a2b7bd744b3a820e0626b448f1e7836","5247a6e3a60ff0381355e66bfc313bf27512ae0c","42ab3412e8a85c32929c2dbdc970c35df89bf5b3","ae0067338dff4e6b48b6b798776ec88a6c242aae","07a5c4ba84268708146aa4bf5cad9491b3e35051","268a7cd1bf65351bba4eb97aac373d624af2c08f","0587ab2146fd821b216a99fb8eab51024d43a973","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","4685abbbefccf769cc09964c6956638a7bfcf132","69ab8fe2bdc2b1ea63d86c7fd64142e5d3ed88ec","1f4df67fefdcf48fdc63a1d3f9ec509f502bafe4","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","364c1a3df58d87cb40ab33fdf3831cf2862f3570","0a22389bd99b7efe3627ec6fc77ddaf3ff5e2faa","a8555994c3a639187d03712e89d609d9a06af7af","2cac08d4eddc03d8d38656e1e57a430afb37670b","839897b416c0fb889ed6a74e3a7d7c0321a9df05","6ab7024ee8d08e393188a72cec6f32037905e9bc","20282a78d7de824dd5567ae78926687fe0bbb061","a36cba3f779e6624d1130f026174b31b0e596bdd","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","ea738439b880ad033ff01602ea52d04b366d0d37","91babfc7d7820c901fe4a7ddb829c2df285e090e","02463e0d580803dca65a48e7fb3d6f407d3d1512","3fa6ccf2e0cf89fe758b9d634030102f9c3f928a","d8a358fb026fda39546cf8e3cbf9e5d754d63463","2e0bed618d023cad81eae218e69afce8bef8e4d6"],"id":"3a835cc957139f9caf0b9ec93b0d1889f4ac2857","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3a835cc957139f9caf0b9ec93b0d1889f4ac2857","authors":[{"name":"Liu Yang","ids":["49576068"]},{"name":"Minghui Qiu","ids":["2642333"]},{"name":"Chen Qu","ids":["49715731"]},{"name":"Jiafeng Guo","ids":["1777025"]},{"name":"Yongfeng Zhang","ids":["1739818"]},{"name":"W.

For a given set S of n elements, it returns a subset of k«l n representatives maximizing the sum of their pairwise distances, where distance models dissimilarity. An important variant of the primitive prescribes that the desired subset of representatives satisfies an additional orthogonal requirement, which can be specified as a matroid constraint (i.e., a feasible solution must be an independent set of size k). While unconstrained max-sum diversity admits efficient coreset-based strategies, the only known approaches dealing with the additional matroid constraint are inherently sequential and are based on an expensive local search over the entire input set. We devise the first coreset constructions for max-sum diversity under various matroid constraints, together with efficient sequential, MapReduce and Streaming implementations. By running the local-search on the coreset rather than on the entire input, we obtain the first practical solutions for large instances. Technically, our coresets are subsets of S containing a feasible solution which is no more than a factor 1-ε away from the optimal solution, for any fixed ε <1, and, for spaces of bounded doubling dimension, they have a small size independent of n. Extensive experiments show that, with respect to full-blown local search, our coreset-based approach yields solutions of comparable quality, with improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in the running time, also for input sets of unknown dimensionality.","inCitations":["fc6f9e829c76891bed5883ddfbb614558871fa21","56bc2a1eebedab3e452a7ca3969aa1e4dd5946c3","7bbf60c92542a717bb88f62d48721082c7b9fb6c"],"pmid":"","title":"Fast Coreset-based Diversity Maximization under Matroid Constraints","journalPages":"81-89","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159719"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Apriori algorithm","Coreset","Data mining","Expectation\u2013maximization algorithm","Experiment","Independent set (graph theory)","Local search (optimization)","MapReduce","Matroid","Period-doubling bifurcation","Requirement","Sequential algorithm","Streaming algorithm","Streaming media","Time complexity","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["24281c886cd9339fe2fc5881faf5ed72b731a03e","3528c682cf344fed9088d8f8511b086dee93a572","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","1349fa45eb6b865bd57ff56c643d7a7655f343de","1aa030557a688e422283cc407bda85e0a0dc3fa8","156d3ae7931cf0c4ee3a1a34f541242914cc66c4","11f0611308d55596bdfbd32f22c9d20ffd400c45","1c36811b51717620b22cf7314bd52df39cb4f00e","11e6355d2fff74b37b2ea4a5b51e7cfb6a09dbe1","11e009813b8734b19097ec47153e2b62ad25ac4a","7ba258baebae241d8556b54cbe866dcf75a2b124","1cdd3c62172b7598cd090e349d38e9644734edfd","0541d5338adc48276b3b8cd3a141d799e2d40150","6821f8ae926b3cb2ac330fc3f0e2b05476a117b5","658e8c1da22787940467fb6a337734d4966e199d","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","e7cdf3a89960c64b1311137fa4c5c5ea1cfc3b1f","03e66d2e5f428454037f865400691652941ba9f1","159efe23527149666be1b2b1c08853d74d413c1b","82afdb9f6b3441bbe4e8a5d6e1d0f5a647748d68","a3ad28b718a226d300ae5301f2bddb0500dc2d83","10ce7db2f749d3a7199205836642e1868b329c03"],"id":"214f526c7763b46ef5cdd1aa026fa7b717ecb970","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/214f526c7763b46ef5cdd1aa026fa7b717ecb970","authors":[{"name":"Matteo Ceccarello","ids":["2739224"]},{"name":"Andrea Pietracaprina","ids":["1750351"]},{"name":"Geppino Pucci","ids":["7688370"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159719"}

I only had the chance to meet Professor Salton once in person, at SIGIR\u201991 in Chicago, where he invited me as a visiting scholar to Cornell. I could not do that then but had been inspired by his great pioneering work on automatic information retrieval (IR) and the SMART system. He could well have pushed me to a more system-oriented path within IR than the one I actually followed. I\u2019m also humbled by the honour of having been chosen to stand among the previous 11 recipients of this award whose contributions to IR are of greatest value. Honestly, I never believed that I would be giving this talk. As the tradition is, based on several examples by prior Salton Award winners, I\u2019d like to present today a personal reflection on IR. I will begin with some personal history in Information Science and IR and continue by discussing my personal view on the goals and scope of IR. Then I\u2019d like to present some studies seeking to approach those goals and discuss their methodological challenges. I came to the field of IR through Information Science. I started at the University of Tampere aiming at a degree in librarianship. However, I was soon introduced to IR, information behaviour and Information Science through inspiring books by Wilfrid Lancaster, Gerard Salton, and Manfred Kochen. My professor also advised me to study Computer Science, which led me to research on database management systems. Within Information Science, the subfield of user and information needs studies was seen to offer a scientific foundation for the development of libraries. The vast majority of the studies were user studies, or institution-centred studies, focusing on the role of users in the life of libraries.

ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-5657-2/18/07. https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210230 I was exposed to ideas by Gernot Wersig (Informationssoziologie), Nick Belkin (the ASK hypothesis), Brenda Dervin (sense-making theory), and D. C. Engelbart (human augmentation research). These led me to view Information Science as a discipline studying people as actors in their work/life \u2013 not as users of some information delivery institutions per se, nor as information seekers per se, but as subjects perceiving their own information environment and interacting with it. At the University of Tampere, we pursued this line of research and contributed to the international debate on the transformation of Information Science from institution focus to person / information practises focus. Alongside Carol C. Kuhlthau\u2019s work on the Information Seeking Process in learning tasks, theoretical reflections led me to think that task complexity affects information seeking. In particular, tasks of different complexity require different types of knowledge to be solved, which may be constructed from information available in different types of sources. Quite self-evident once stated, but not that simple to study. Task complexity as a factor in information interaction got quite popular, however. Others have extended its application in IR and seeking studies, e.g. by proposing taxonomies of work tasks and search tasks. Following the rise of test-collection based IR research, we established our IR Lab and the research group FIRE in the beginning of 1990\u2019s. The IR community focused then on developing ranked retrieval systems that scale up to handling large collections. That research was without doubt very important and successful. Still we thought that a broader user-oriented scope would be beneficial to the field. To advance this, we thought, one needs credibility earned through becoming a full member of the community \u2013 through carrying out successful research with similar goals. In addition to making use of the TReC test collections, we decided to build a Finnish language test collection. This had two important benefits: one in the development of NLP methods for IR, and the other in the comeback of graded relevance assessments in IR evaluation. The former led us to quite successful in research into applications of NLP methods in IR across a range of languages; crosslanguage IR using a range of approaches across a range of language pairs; and approximate string matching methods for searching with words not covered by other approaches. The latter inspired the development of evaluation metrics based on graded relevance assessments \u2013 the Cumulated Gain metrics family, foremost the nDCG metric. We proposed it as a user-oriented metric because it was based on graded relevance, allowed weighing of relevance levels and discounting the gain incurring from documents found late on the result list.

Our model, LRML (Latent Relational Metric Learning) is a novel metric learning approach for recommendation. More speci\u0080cally, instead of simple push-pull mechanisms between user and item pairs, we propose to learn latent relations that describe each user item interaction. \u008cis helps to alleviate the potential geometric in\u0083exibility of existing metric learing approaches. \u008cis enables not only be\u008aer performance but also a greater extent of modeling capability, allowing our model to scale to a larger number of interactions. In order to do so, we employ a augmented memory module and learn to a\u008aend over these memory blocks to construct latent relations. \u008ce memory-based a\u008aention module is controlled by the user-item interaction, making the learned relation vector speci\u0080c to each user-item pair. Hence, this can be interpreted as learning an exclusive and optimal relational translation for each user-item interaction. \u008ce proposed architecture demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance across multiple recommendation benchmarks. LRML outperforms other metric learning models by 6% − 7.5% in terms of Hits@10 and nDCG@10 on large datasets such as Net\u0083ix and MovieLens20M. Moreover, qualitative studies also demonstrate evidence that our proposed model is able to infer and encode explicit sentiment, temporal and a\u008aribute information despite being only trained on implicit feedback. As such, this ascertains the ability of LRML to uncover hidden relational structure within implicit datasets.","inCitations":["fb698241a9a6dec0ddd3e0bf85485ee0e31cbb6a","3e45ff12f098291d0fec1184eac4f24b32172126","6264736e6a92379a3aa4bca92c5bcf5dc1b5575e","7225b446d36c3d49f7be3cdcfc60537df1fb43e5","a01b81eb04b150f39ef102ac11ebdc2de1916946","b2016c936e83c8402f7ceec30e1b8a8a30e78e7d","164b4c02957540a5901d5e4a43473ee88c745973","b5c3c7893cf503bff7ef4f962056d7055f19c0f5","bf25fc54f9c1f02384840eb763ab8e34620a1731","1942250b72d2a195db11fbadd9ab7ee6a12027a3","0cfac458b176a1e81879aff4344c5278114cc171"],"pmid":"","title":"Latent Relational Metric Learning via Memory-based Attention for Collaborative Ranking","journalPages":"729-739","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe0c/3094d81d40374d6e6e1107a4724ec36cd311.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186154","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05176v3.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Benchmark (computing)","ENCODE","Interaction","Logical equality","Memory module"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1b29786b7e43dda1a4d6ee93f520a2960b1e3126","d5a823053663a77869d4b38a8026c51ebc2e975e","261b447f58db876247bcdd5343a5c79fbcf01268","087cb6fa2dffd6a38f3f9baeccff79c3d84c1e1f","081ad92ce0e71541646218f11061c86414a960c2","5324ba064dc1656dd51c04122c2c802ef9ec28ce","9e63233e36f70361c3fb00b2a2894951e7606852","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","24e2ac56c810f773bd4b2d03e7e9bc1a4519ed7a","24be66032aa1957e6f2ca714b76689093725dafe","10ebd5c40277ecba4ed45d3dc12f9f1226720523","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","6b8b2075319accc23fef43e4cf76bc3682189d82","29d591806cdc6ef0d580e4a21f32e5ad9d09d148","087ab67119b7caf129e93d8daa170a7c12a2a8f6","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","276ebc620a8976026bd2d03582b9ecfa3738d43c","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","fb641dbada6a27b009cb28a629e7f02fbeec6e10","2ef7d506b25731d0f3ec0c8f90b718b6e5bbd069","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726","1b1df9f75ee6f27433687dad302387f811dab64d","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","0842636e2efd5a0c0f34ae88785af29612814e17","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","64edd2c5c41e856695e1dcb950c0512c3a87edec","bf9ca74b5b82e9679383e0d1e9e4ae9b14b68b99","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","09a503095db2d68b439e48d67481399198ed0e5b","fab77f4f239e73469af62102d91e4d5404b5d7b3","12db83e66e50152e170d5009c425c925ad2e2c2a","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","5720a5015ca67400fadd0ff6863519f4b030e731"],"id":"23b0a959d07a744a80734119e94262f14f2d83e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/23b0a959d07a744a80734119e94262f14f2d83e1","authors":[{"name":"Yi Tay","ids":["3665875"]},{"name":"Luu Anh Tuan","ids":["26336902"]},{"name":"Siu Cheung Hui","ids":["1716044"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186154"}

Given the variety of approaches, collective agreement on the indicators that signify credible content could allow for greater collaboration and data-sharing across initiatives. In this paper, we present an initial set of indicators for article credibility defined by a diverse coalition of experts. These indicators originate from both within an article\u2019s text as well as from external sources or article metadata. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dataset of 40 articles of varying credibility annotated with our indicators by 6 trained annotators using specialized platforms. We discuss future steps including expanding annotation, broadening the set of indicators, and considering their use by platforms and the public, towards the development of interoperable standards for content credibility.

Important requirements of ICT4D projects are a demand-driven approach and participation of the local community. The fact that user collaboration is a principle of Agile software development (Agile), triggers our interest on whether Agile practices can improve ICT4D projects. This paper aims to investigate if and how Agile can contribute to the success of ICT4D projects. In order to achieve this, existing literature was consulted and an interview was held. This paper provides an overview of the critical success factors for ICT4D projects and Agile, as well as of the advantages of Agile. Agile can only work successfully when ICT4D projects are demand-driven, and when both a cultural understanding and trust are built. Notable ways in which Agile can improve ICT4D projects are by facilitating user collaboration, improving team communication, enhancing organizational learning, and by frequently delivering software.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Improving ICT4D Projects with Agile Software Development","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e2d7/c93d25e9c9f14df0420e9c7dca4540b09179.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://perspectivesonict4d.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ict4d18_paper_31.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2120/paper4.pdf"],"entities":["Agile software development","Iterative method","Requirement","Software engineering"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9d01b9a2f8962d4008ca1f65cd2f6c6ab06d3503","dd6c8931d276f258d356e65416018725912d2dbd","fdec2882ba9ac901914dc7936d245ef3430eeed4","0a62a5a3500e2b07e57d22720c0a681f32fa9d96","82c1cf53da64f6fc56552a7a5bb07d5188e83c38","8e3dc7208bc743037716f327ba98a7fcb1a69502","8b3c34edfcaf5eb6480b0d043b1b4685a54870dc","86c0754d758b14a292d1a946afecffe3033757ba","3f2016384a7a2b8c96a760f3591d48ef57ffd154","0591f8477c3cb96b75292020f22ccbb190b03a23","e8b53eedc87949f503de7d25be9ae670b95c866c","15c3d1158676931a608d22968a854fb28c616a60","01a14d739072a32e401a6784f46952f81eb50acf","14c72f34f82ef330b4bf4ff2308e0ea0ba0e18a7","ddead7808c012285a6467194b0f45f4f6de37c3e","1bd25bfef98c3709992d5551bca204f062201e26","895f77aa909e4caaf0088f6a3a418ce11b862b75","2aa8779c354974967b781124143b39bdbecc6e37","76651e4ae0b071969a12d62992d936beefcb8fde","3c381bec3c255d3c7fc6eedf4c18becb0ba17886","b4ca52f90867676d3a20d63880968512b3149874","28ff67054354eefd05718d9c8e2c135607355f24","61a28d606ec933cbfae00e6a6bb1d515f9b2171b","65029d85c2e31803c7ee283b87f83383fe7226c6","b8da412822de5700b84a8804540e7027f25d28c3","81edf345b076178eccfcaeee286906b055a3f2c0","003159621eccf73715f7295758fb3e88f595b784","af5619d8279c5939feafcc095bace26beb13d618","92f7c6fc518dd91c2fce99fc6816530fd486d821","5015e332f5c9f1f9d059b6fa0644a689fe64a017","236d0279e088809e41b6dd7c468e15b1eb8f1544","35d2b12af3d67ed52262355e67ca2ee011020f51","a52746b077ed0d84741ff7cc162c9bb207a7dfac","d7b9dde9a7d304b378079049a0c2af40454a13bb"],"id":"e2d7c93d25e9c9f14df0420e9c7dca4540b09179","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2d7c93d25e9c9f14df0420e9c7dca4540b09179","authors":[{"name":"Joost Dijkers","ids":["51215807"]},{"name":"S.

Feature driven method and point process method are two basic thinking paradigms to tackle the prediction problem, but both of them suffer from limitations. In this paper, we propose PreNets unifying the two thinking paradigms in an adversarial manner. On one side, feature driven model acts like a 'critic' who aims to discriminate the predicted popularity from the real one based on a set of temporal features from the sequence. On the other side, point process model acts like an 'interpreter' who recognizes the dynamic patterns in sequence to generate a predicted popularity that can fool the 'critic'. Through a Wasserstein learning based two-player game, the training loss of the 'critic' guides the 'interpreter' to better exploit the sequence patterns and enhance prediction, while the 'interpreter' pushes the 'critic' to select effective early features that helps discrimination. This mechanism enables the framework to absorb the advantages of both feature driven and point process methods. Empirical results show that PreNets achieves significant MAPE improvement for both Twitter cascade and Amazon review prediction.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Adversarial Training Model Unifying Feature Driven and Point Process Perspectives for Event Popularity Prediction","journalPages":"517-526","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271714"],"entities":["Microsoft Customer Care Framework","Minimax","Open research","Point process","Process modeling","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["97b5190600b26d6fee0772cb3207b23a6dc5c267","a0724060cfc3195c2a3dad458f997c59e8597ed7","0738bee349250853d79fc6ccd3dc09aa794ac120","4c0827bd2bf4652a615b0838f9ec7965b9b4b2ea","ba61f2a22ce43747d855397b337dde645d24fe15","e624565a5b17ee7cc40fc5640aaa27c9c670fa0d","a5fa7b7fcc2abc9bae5e30e21174d4f730041976","625ef5356b3e8f7a787a805c23ce4c34640ed596","ad14eef3417749207388edc424907919ee5566e1","0318f19753bd9d42128150d9a7d27dda0a8da96e","6431df4d98360373ce9de0843450cddaafd1f9d5","46aca9fd693cda49f7f02d575efaee0977f078c7","57703ce4befb07cec2182f2e70d38f7281266d01","1b8abb3351226ebf254893b0685a0b87c94bccd9","2fc51707d56f8dc2a8873cdc1ea7b1800260884d","698b88adeff47d8c22e348f8a4c3c47c920f994c","496d47f6924382aee6658cb8260e3a4b09ae3f9e","be9472665dfdad9c5a499b39648ddd5a0020e4c3","f84ce7af2272428232d76d6352a50599ba07576f","5287d8fef49b80b8d500583c07e935c7f9798933","0e443ed401707d9bf95aca485709400d6b5eae63","4761f0fd96284103ecd3603349c7f8078ad28676","4902805fe1e2f292f6beed7593154e686d7f6dc2","dba35988c8e82c5ccd724bb2039b6c5175adc839","267cf324f04f1993227f780af3555ea7d6c59c26","11bd4ee4993ae89dafaed935f5749df6b50f780a","589f7899ebb2b8d1534876decfd7aba74793744a","95fe17bf04c2007bb48760a1bc43eeba9899ca29","119a67a62b0e9351e4348d234d9eae4c84f366a3","651ae94750c28c57ea6b3f5f2b0fedc83236f1d9","a70b6c304a2dc6afcc63155ffc6191af57c42750","503755661e0b15e4357a5bdd8e8070fc6cb2fb9f","3d338953e47b54cfa07e2f544158478d9e6301fb","9a700c7a7e7468e436f00c34551fbe3e0f70e42f","1073c29baf6d9cfc7b7b028024b58ed070696da3","9fb10a3c2dcec939784ce208e0e7e7fda4be895c","6de2b1058c5b717878cce4e7e50d3a372cc4aaa6","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","2d1546e72bc294f83570346c6ef1289dd7be9b41","d0e51833b3db3af1c762ab723efd08f117a497c8"],"id":"bf99275a9262865eef19434fa80ebc500e4e61d7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bf99275a9262865eef19434fa80ebc500e4e61d7","authors":[{"name":"Qitian Wu","ids":["51171144"]},{"name":"Chaoqi Yang","ids":["51166038"]},{"name":"Hengrui Zhang","ids":["35466544"]},{"name":"Xiaofeng Gao","ids":["11732258"]},{"name":"Paul Weng","ids":["38481975"]},{"name":"Guihai Chen","ids":["34421345"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271714"}

It exploits differences in how browsers and web servers interpret relative paths (i.e., path confusion) to make a HTML page reference itself as a stylesheet; a simple text injection vulnerability alongwith browsers\u2019 leniency in parsing CSS resources results in an attacker\u2019s ability to inject style directives that will be interpreted by the browser. Even though style injection may appear less serious a threat than script injection, it has been shown that it enables a range of attacks, including secret exfiltration. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of the Web to measure the prevalence and significance of style injection using RPO. Our work shows that around 9% of the sites in the Alexa Top 10,000 contain at least one vulnerable page, out of which more than one third can be exploited. We analyze in detail various impediments to successful exploitation, and make recommendations for remediation. In contrast to script injection, relatively simple countermeasures exist to mitigate style injection. However, there appears to be little awareness of this attack vector as evidenced by a range of popular Content Management Systems (CMSes) that we found to be exploitable.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Large-Scale Analysis of Style Injection by Relative Path Overwrite","journalPages":"237-246","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6111/fac5ab92fc341416fe668a03516e02c46711.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00917v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00917","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186090","http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/arshad/publications/www2018rpo.pdf"],"entities":["Attack (computing)","Cascading Style Sheets","Content management system","HTML","Markup language","Parsing","Path ordering (term rewriting)","SimpleText","Vector (malware)","Web crawler","Web server","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["24ea6a8713b991f62f0894837924c949731f41ea","106df683ba67b9fa0239409d1e8b19cd9db413b2","e9ea725fd00695ca77779fa2b4a525fd1560cd89","9084da84025cc58c51859f5e437fc80b5864f19a","ae93529e8b9b1770593fae83f86803c6a7b529ea","dc928505f207692a6fdc4c028c0c69c5bd896846","49a8f9e8ed7dbd8382dbd30aa81321281cd54c07","c38ff647b9fc57eee17980221bacd040f1668bf5","42bc888624f8888d5e730b3e59432164cb62fc69","1374cf2c4815cd6e389ea2860f2b70284d7a856b","1ffc8b184461954d05627e78480223560dd5e82d","4d00e4d162e4949ccc8803cbd984324d4fc992a2","39956c83458d106462b77f974d0398bf0e511f5a","018a8e03a8c7ac02ad5bd00d6af6bbf833a55c84","552c849b53936f28302c879350694598187b2a40","2946337452f2dc8b2942e81252c2ab0629a4b4e5","492c2218f1cd089cbd336b96275e5afbc2a5b648","c6b24743d3e29b2de9d146b03fdec3a18bdf6633","533da0b2143bdee2304ebae7a22f91054d83068a","7952392115106e04b1daea1ad8ddeae2137e95bb","351c6d9b736d8e6b776efdd449776b7c340cd8d7","814c77b206071618a1bb3c711c91440af7ddf7cf","64205427d0f900997ec0a22fdd4946a3ba16f1b9"],"id":"6111fac5ab92fc341416fe668a03516e02c46711","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6111fac5ab92fc341416fe668a03516e02c46711","authors":[{"name":"Sajjad Arshad","ids":["2786583"]},{"name":"Seyed Ali Mirheidari","ids":["2319102"]},{"name":"Tobias Lauinger","ids":["1760272"]},{"name":"Bruno Crispo","ids":["1701596"]},{"name":"Engin Kirda","ids":["1707794"]},{"name":"William K.

As a new family of effective general approaches to text data retrieval and analysis, probabilistic topic models---notably Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDA), and their many extensions---have been studied actively in the past decade with widespread applications. These topic models are powerful tools for extracting and analyzing latent topics contained in text data; they also provide a general and robust latent semantic representation of text data, thus improving many applications in information retrieval and text mining. Since they are general and robust, they can be applied to text data in any natural language and about any topics. This tutorial systematically reviews the major research progress in probabilistic topic models and discuss their applications in text retrieval and text mining. The tutorial provides (1) an in-depth explanation of the basic concepts, underlying principles, and the two basic topic models (i.e., PLSA and LDA) that have widespread applications, (2) an introduction to EM algorithms and Bayesian inference algorithms for topic models, (3) a hands-on exercise to allow the tutorial attendants to learn how to use the topic models implemented in the MeTA Open Source Toolkit and experiment with provided data sets, (4) a broad overview of all the major representative topic models that extend PLSA or LDA, and (5) a discussion of major challenges and future research directions.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Tutorial on Probabilistic Topic Models for Text Data Retrieval and Analysis","journalPages":"1395-1398","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210189"],"entities":["Algorithm","Data retrieval","Document retrieval","Hands-on computing","Information retrieval","Natural language","Probabilistic latent semantic analysis","Text corpus","Text mining"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","8ed1a7317a727dd47ae1f182c5caeeb484a76599"],"id":"bedad77e64a18f4224f5e81595bcc180e87714a9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bedad77e64a18f4224f5e81595bcc180e87714a9","authors":[{"name":"ChengXiang Zhai","ids":["1736467"]},{"name":"Chase Geigle","ids":["3125584"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210189"}

For this purpose distributed programming paradigms such as Apache Spark on top of Hadoop are increasingly being used. Unfortunately, the Hadoop ecosystem lacks support for Semantic Web standards, e.g. reading an RDF serialization format, and thus, bringing in RDF data still requires a large amount of effort. We therefore present PRoST-loader, an application which, given a set of N-Triples documents, creates logical partitions according to three widely adopted strategies: Triple Table (TT), Wide Property Table (WPT) with a single row for each subject, and Vertical Partitioning (VP). Each strategy has its own advantages and limitations depending on the data characteristics and the task to be carried out. The loader thus leaves the strategy choice to the data engineer. The tool combines the flexibility of Spark, the deserialization capabilities of Hive, as well as the compression power of Apache Parquet at the storage layer. We managed to process Dbpedia (approx. 257M triples) in 3.5 min for TT, in approx 3.1 days for VP, and in 16.8 min for WPT with up to 1,114 columns in a cluster with moderate resources. In this paper we aim to present the strategies followed, but also to expose the community to this open-source tool, which facilitates the usage of Semantic Web data within the Hadoop ecosystem and which makes it possible to carry out tasks such as the evaluation of SPARQL queries in a scalable manner.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Flexible N-Triples Loader for Hadoop","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/556a/29cacdccb7d0a9e70aa8bdd06956639b8833.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-04.pdf"],"entities":["Apache Hadoop","Apache Hive","Apache Parquet","Apache Spark","Approximation","Binary space partitioning","Column (database)","DBpedia","Data model","Database","Distributed computing","Ecosystem","Maxima and minima","Multistage interconnection networks","Open-source software","Programming paradigm","Resource Description Framework","SPARQL","Scalability","Semantic Web","Serialization","Web standards"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c3b028e65ccfbd80d8d3c3f0cedb6b0c2edd06c8","3ab9bd75bd968186259ce8aa6f19824faf5718f7","16bae0f9f6a2823b2a65f6296494eea41f5c9859","a531fb4d4e91c79adf6d81928e1ca5e64dcab3e8","5d3158674e1a0fedf69299a905151949fb8b01a5","019c886c2326f826298c8f48fe82dbae85ca5f2d"],"id":"556a29cacdccb7d0a9e70aa8bdd06956639b8833","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/556a29cacdccb7d0a9e70aa8bdd06956639b8833","authors":[{"name":"Victor Anthony Arrascue Ayala","ids":["3108054"]},{"name":"Georg Lausen","ids":["1809410"]}],"doi":""}

Its path-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies conceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin and altcoins), and makes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the remittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond. This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its inception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect the IOU credit of linnet users\u2019 wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in the current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling flag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across those links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly connected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the core of the network and provide high liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base of around 112, 000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10 highly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be withdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway tagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale exchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not always been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers according to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were used by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid-July to mid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the health of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity, and by appropriately maintaining the credit limits, rippling flags, and exchange offers on their IOU credit links.","inCitations":["e4251da46a8e79c6eaecc709df1f6c2292b119bb","bb4a374ade0b19ced3ca9f273f8c240890893e08","9af63b45c6ddd772179d250536e0055955597037"],"pmid":"","title":"Mind Your Credit: Assessing the Health of the Ripple Credit Network","journalPages":"329-338","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c95/a6110b3f877f7a8d2a5b9a40353b25db30ff.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02358v2.pdf","https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pmorenos/public/ripple-study-www.pdf","https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/papers/WWW2018.pdf","https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/pdf/moreno2017mind.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q52184531","http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02358"],"entities":["Cryptocurrency","Internet backbone","Norm (social)","Ripple","Rippling","USB hub"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a1ab83fc0655ef514864bc8af79711d1224ce36","35ff80b9a8ad9b75e2a1509d71de892c02e55a53","149cdc2f5287d021ce7a2bb7d3123df2d225fa26","e1167e0f5dae02d254af60825be6f493814ee074","109b422ec3ec3bb24a804c8104dae55154d07459","f7411951fae7f20f5cbb70191642bff04cc3a040","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","34c559b3e7edab0ea72b8c6c7e27c5d9078156ec","ce69fde1bcc7e49dfc1a1df76426fdf287983bff","35fe18606529d82ce3fc90961dd6813c92713b3c","30f9ce2feb3b08b79859beefdbef00e98f9c0003","51b70e7af29c8c7869af8eb6d70e49600b6ba1a6","14829636fee5a1cf8dee9737849a8e2bdaf9a91f","93bae7155092c8ba1ae1c4ad9f30ae1b7c829dd7","cd283c1ecc7f164cae31f4419a9968cdfd0b0937","239bb3410d66da9823801361fbf1a6eaead372a0","0cf0c343ae17b0db4b5564b22480aa0415ef61af","f81a6e61ec9935c2c2f37dbea4a36aa284c2e6ef","cc9b027bd1b8c0ee854992bb56e64d72ebf3355e","520300d401f5b2c3673966bf86954159c7cea595","7f62f8e96c03088b6a61e494efcc30c2c49c063b","7e61f5691517214d38c89807dc2177b9743007a7"],"id":"766221c1e7100456954c4c821f96ed764b9c20fc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/766221c1e7100456954c4c821f96ed764b9c20fc","authors":[{"name":"Pedro Moreno-Sanchez","ids":["2970940"]},{"name":"Navin Modi","ids":["30774579"]},{"name":"Raghuvir Songhela","ids":["2023283"]},{"name":"Aniket Kate","ids":["1828965"]},{"name":"Sonia Fahmy","ids":["1680676"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186099"}

Experiments on several real-world networks illustrate that by considering different relations between different node pairs, our method is capable of producing node embeddings of higher quality than a number of state-of-the-art network embedding methods, as evaluated on a challenging multi-label node classification task.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Enhanced Network Embeddings via Exploiting Edge Labels.","journalPages":"1579-1582","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1809.05124","http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05124","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05124v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269270"],"entities":["Binary data","Experiment","IBM Notes","Multi-label classification","Protein structure prediction","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f53a3e1b9a41c852c1c9692138a8e3306cba252d","1762baa638866a13dcc6d146fd5a49b36cbd9c30","2bb2ba7c96d40e269fc6a2d5384c739ff9fa16eb","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","0c7f1d285ce069b2f7a807a4b2750695098bffe6","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","5ec39dcadbfa096592ac811679c3e1eb8ddff7db","064fb3a6f2666e17f6d411c0a731d56aae0a785e","feee6ea8961398e599577f9f793230d391985b88","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726","c4883a12c455eeea6ac9f22239837be16f0f5b9f","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","ada33b43df07107147899fdfdfd6a7ba09691dd6","d0b7c8828f0fca4dd901674e8fb5bd464a187664"],"id":"5101432b0f819f98c86a41fd642da47eb6b9ae5d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5101432b0f819f98c86a41fd642da47eb6b9ae5d","authors":[{"name":"Haochen Chen","ids":["3381852"]},{"name":"Xiaofei Sun","ids":["49816175"]},{"name":"Yingtao Tian","ids":["48391641"]},{"name":"Bryan Perozzi","ids":["2271808"]},{"name":"Muhao Chen","ids":["1998918"]},{"name":"Steven Skiena","ids":["1721948"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269270"}

Movement intention recognition paves the path for developing BCI applications. The current state-of-the-art in EEG based BCI usually involves subject-specific adaptation before ready to use. However, the subject-independent scenario, in which a well-trained model is directly applied to new subjects without any pre-calibration, is particularly desired yet rarely explored. In order to fill the gap, we present a Convolutional Attention Model (CAM) for EEG-based human movement intention recognition in the subject-independent scenario. The convolutional network is designed to capture the spatio-temporal features of EEG signals, while the integrated attention mechanism is utilized to focus on the most discriminative information of EEG signals during the period of movement imagination while omitting other less relative parts. Experiments conducted on a real-world EEG dataset containing 55 subjects show that our model is capable of mining the underlying invariant EEG patterns across different subjects and generalizing to unseen subjects. Our model achieves better performance than a series of state-of-the-art and baseline approaches.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Ready for Use: Subject-Independent Movement Intention Recognition via a Convolutional Attention Model","journalPages":"1763-1766","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269259"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Brain\u2013computer interface","Electroencephalography","Experiment","Peripheral"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d9e41f5505c39be4282dcd21ad7c749ab292c474","0b80d18c1b5db0ca138a9514dd0d97f316103b1e","524b707e6904f56104a539a8989194296181bac6","6d307ddf2b8d8528c5d4e561f14181cd2bc8ea98","e7b56f15fcf6c613e82220d53782e8e036a3e000","0c3834e00dc0a241b58781f1377a6572409c2544","107db767407eddeb0d83b9183511fd3a3fdc6723","d8286a838080720cb3ad9e851483cf3ba749e506"],"id":"689545db0c1047eb68073d1a4dd2fe4f097df091","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/689545db0c1047eb68073d1a4dd2fe4f097df091","authors":[{"name":"Dalin Zhang","ids":["2679444"]},{"name":"Lina Yao","ids":["2082966"]},{"name":"Kaixuan Chen","ids":["5502859"]},{"name":"Sen Wang","ids":["27379874"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269259"}

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a popular technique for performing approximate searches in high-dimensional multimedia, such as image or sensory data. Often times, these multimedia data are represented as a collection of important spatio-temporal features which are extracted by using localized feature extraction algorithms. When a user wants to search for a given entity (object, event, or observation), individual similarity search queries, which collectively form a set query, need to be performed on the features that represent the particular search entity. Existing LSH techniques require that users provide an accuracy guarantee for each query in the set query, instead of an overall guarantee for the entire set query, which can lead to misses or wasteful work. We propose a novel index structure, Point Set LSH (PSLSH), which is able to execute a similarity search for a given set of search points in the high-dimensional space with a user-provided guarantee for the entire set query. Experimental evaluation shows significant gains in efficiency and accuracy trade-offs for executing set queries in high-dimensional spaces.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"PSLSH: An Index Structure for Efficient Execution of Set Queries in High-Dimensional Spaces","journalPages":"477-486","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271691"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Database index","Euclidean distance","Feature extraction","Hamming distance","Locality of reference","Locality-sensitive hashing","Similarity search","Spaces","Web search query","lsh"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["226bab70ecb9e13ef8fdb503a6183615d5c898ed","276285e996c08a26706979be838fd94abae2fed9","7852d1f7ed81875445caa40b65e67e2813a484d2","d7fdd34b7cec0b25b206154ba9eb820160f9d8be","3f1e54ed3bd801766e1897d53a9fc962524dd3c2","69c4582192730aee35fc58c1136f27093608eadc","40349f066fd2ced16138a016256755dc45ff031c","1a998506899da3bc703455bde45114bd4c228947","ff860f9c61f0d783d48893f671e986a01e5c3026","08d23f55450cc87cc1dd0c359837ac4037ae85ef","51bb6450e617986d1bd8566878f7693ffd03132d","490020c0d4fa1eb85fe353add5713e49f08c628d","456bc56efe30b4a24a7fdb39b74eadb0e0e0f8db","1955266a8a58d94e41ad0efe20d707c92a069e95","4ffcbd052cf0a403f275beb0b1c06168ecbd9806","17a1578ae3f3be0d3effc2a7d43b9cd97fd19572","1d0d1b10384e4459fb49d1ba86ccaa45627dff2b","2555cd819ea26c78bf3d58ca4094f77984a10426","2498f18f143b96fba9716caba5c46bacddf1d20a","1d32f29a9880998264286633e66ea92915cc557a","203d57edec4cca1425a88481d65ad435f8f73b76"],"id":"4cf8c2c2c39fe33f58ac9f1396f1b204b7b31306","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4cf8c2c2c39fe33f58ac9f1396f1b204b7b31306","authors":[{"name":"Parth Nagarkar","ids":["2001909"]},{"name":"K.

For individual CPs, understanding user behavior, in particular how users migrate among different CPs, is crucial for improving users' on-site experience and the CP's chance of success. In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to analyze and model user migration behavior in video streaming, i.e., users switching content provider during active sessions. Based on a large ISP dataset over two months (6 major content providers, 3.8 million users, and 315 million video requests), we study common migration patterns and reasons of migration. We find that migratory behavior is prevalent: 66% of users switch CPs with an average switching frequency of 13%. In addition, migration behaviors are highly diverse: regardless large or small CPs, they all have dedicated groups of users who like to switch to them for certain types of videos. Regarding reasons of migration, we find CP service quality rarely causes migration, while a few popular videos play a bigger role. Nearly 60% of cross-site migrations are landed to 0.14% top videos. Finally, we validate our findings by building an accurate regression model to predict user migration frequency, and discuss the implications of our results to CPs.","inCitations":["78fec5a93a53063d8c79f919f495a115d3209e57"],"pmid":"","title":"On Migratory Behavior in Video Consumption","journalPages":"1109-1118","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://people.cs.vt.edu/~gangwang/video17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132884"],"entities":["Clock rate","Cross-site cooking","Streaming media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7da24bcadf4df972057c208372293e2da68fd8ac","614acf1813ac4c80aec0452be4c2598cb0945e44","2cda5f949b6e4c5c75fe5a72923e2dfb67f464ec","131d9428e919cd5c5206b8a5dcf3be838f98b26f","4ad9a701f6136751f2841d8e9218d5523a115e01","d76840b8d7e7642336fd7e7ce28321145a0e1d22","5f7e5933e2ce4b846fa4edbb387f613f767f1522","025293699fbf4756796f890cc3359dccedfe18ad","4eb2f2cdb39cd9a8e2450e54f3ad4a91b84a47ee","dba35988c8e82c5ccd724bb2039b6c5175adc839","7ca08d3d65c2bef7d9e1dd683d9679f8f5a65202","bfee37633a52b0cdf6b17f8f6552ebb39545daa6","6a6cfe3209e4dfaa45a5a13a988b47b5dc5425b9","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","14b4f0e8e2a12eb10cfa5e6aed7cff8df8637757","516f842467cc89f0d6551823d6aa0af2c3233c75","d8221bd3916bc6c254ab1cf84f56c2b92ce453d9","13cbb1b747814aa6db01892861a601c6b33dd697","5722a980758e812ef5ed77e582a7a242e138d289","58227bb7c9865b5d89dc26a3a0822e9c7a009ec9","0973a954835aba2b5d7a20ddcca34fcd2d02d1a1","c7ab5c0886f8a9b3570d215ab981c63c77433f1f","43cc2a3c3500ab42a506454b7ab8e9b7839a96ec","6b461615ae3f68458b57a3f28d7e022f68dc5fd9","47f94c0cd9876dea43d76a5be98de7646457c000","615fe45ab84a24d432f023394a8db3d03bb6006a","ee6dd820de431443d68909b1e3e6ed6ec678bd2b","5f60d63d9cd751781f474ef40434edf9e3125d67","28ea425e48eb7e38df55b74d9c2c816ec47bdc18","0a17a81e2e738707836005b62447f12383ddb6ac","1a29dd17b602bbbb487285fc6aa5fa2bb9bf8649","04f96789fdee1df571a4bd2dca1e46f0522f1746","1af88a8430fedde965b4cf15488b5a397b9b09f3","24f95cc73758d870706fe8ab590d477b9dd2b791"],"id":"14ff3b41678dce46a2f490b239be769779a9d1e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/14ff3b41678dce46a2f490b239be769779a9d1e1","authors":[{"name":"Huan Yan","ids":["2060052"]},{"name":"Tzu-Heng Lin","ids":["6972563"]},{"name":"Gang Wang","ids":["50248340"]},{"name":"Yong Li","ids":["39948674"]},{"name":"Haitao Zheng","ids":["2704852"]},{"name":"Depeng Jin","ids":["1717719"]},{"name":"Ben Y.

Digital libraries commonly provide advanced search interfaces, through which researchers can find and explore the most related scientific studies. Even though the publications of a single author can be easily retrieved and explored, understanding how authors have collaborated with each other on specific research topics and to what extent their collaboration have been fruitful is, in general, a challenging task. This paper proposes a new pattern-based approach to analyzing the correlations among the authors of most influential research studies. To this purpose, it analyzes publication data retrieved from digital libraries and online databases by means of an itemset-based data mining algorithm. It automatically extracts patterns representing the most relevant collaborations among authors on specific research topics. Patterns are evaluated and ranked according to the number of citations received by the corresponding publications. The proposed approach was validated in a real case study, i.e., the analysis of scientific literature on genomics. Specifically, we first analyzed scientific studies on genomics acquired from the OMIM database to discover correlations between authors and genes or genetic disorders. Then, the reliability of the discovered patterns was assessed using the PubMed search engine. The results show that, for the majority of the mined patterns, the most influential (top ranked) studies retrieved by performing author-driven PubMed queries range over the same gene/genetic disorder indicated by the top ranked pattern.","inCitations":["77da0ef71f838d93753535848c1d6cf2d08ba5ff","40f780e6f7b21ed1ca1cb973bb797c040a01118d","10f84abbe3790146ce46619c162b92a192b7f6b7"],"pmid":"","title":"Identifying Collaborations among Researchers: a pattern-based approach","journalPages":"56-68","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e6be/30608794895e1adc55ef34ce1cf948831d56.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1888/paper5.pdf","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~birndl-sigir2017/BIRNDL_Cagliero.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Data mining","Database","Digital library","Library (computing)","MinEd","Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man","PubMed","Scientific literature","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1436850b814dc45cb9262f05549512041b75cc79","5d007cef78d7c209c7e4fec9d09315d09ef680b8","c8fb0b771bd740f82e7306ff48f7b641ce3fc487","92c43bf9bd0e535ab1fc7573dc192e6d4c25728d","99388a0d3beb526a13421ed088743b30a75e2b29","197ef20f1c652589da145a625093e8b31082c470","607d738d4acc726d9e68f37a07b7a9f2b27c90f5","37d5d2b0d392231d7deae1b2a4f13cbf54c9e184","906d1d75cb4ef5b8e2f88e7d4bd33ae646bd75d2","35f7374c1fc743487a76ff5b7cf4479a1ea0b3f2","57e9443d64e2545dbee470a5960017855dc97a5e","3096595380cfc118bb163b74897e13a84d094432","95b934f981771499fb0c425e50d5442c834916be","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","6e31ad98cf839424e152461e7044992604de0d9a","1e602df3d8feec53f155f9001790c77f3fe9c583"],"id":"7f9bfb07582300c6e43293858fb53443a76f9731","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7f9bfb07582300c6e43293858fb53443a76f9731","authors":[{"name":"Luca Cagliero","ids":["1692878"]},{"name":"Paolo Garza","ids":["1712027"]},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Kavoosifar","ids":["3445883"]},{"name":"Elena Baralis","ids":["1750105"]}],"doi":""}

Recommending trades for an online bartering platform shares many similarities with traditional approaches to recommendation, in particular the need to model the preferences of users and the properties of the items they consume. However, there are several aspects that make bartering problems interesting and challenging, specifically the fact that users are both suppliers and consumers, and that the trading environment is highly dynamic. Thus, a successful model of bartering requires us to understand not just users' preferences, but also the social dynamics of who trades with whom, and the temporal dynamics of when trades occur.\n We propose new models for bartering-based recommendation, for which we introduce three novel datasets from online bartering platforms. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods (based on matching algorithms) perform poorly on real-world platforms, as they rely on idealized assumptions that are not supported by real bartering data. We develop approaches based on Matrix Factorization in order to model the reciprocal interest between users and each other's items. We also find that the social ties between members have a strong influence, as does the time at which they trade, therefore we extend our model to be socially- and temporally-aware. We evaluate our approach on trades covering books, video games, and beers, where we obtain promising empirical performance compared to existing techniques.","inCitations":["0d12d9fa7750608d3f938d8987c1f38824ebe696"],"pmid":"","title":"Bartering Books to Beers: A Recommender System for Exchange Platforms","journalPages":"505-514","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/wsdm17.pdf","http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/wsdm17.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018696","https://jrappaz.com/static/homepage/wsdm17-slides.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Bi-directional text","Book","Coherence (physics)","Hot swapping","Matrix regularization","Paging","Preference learning","Recommender system","Social dynamics","Temporal logic","Video clip","Wish list","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7f0497ef1dde124662201a58a72f6f2a209b8b2c","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","037d739e06466aff6af129842395364fb97842a9","43450fd9b0060d386aa0b034f55b9fecb5a70ed6","40947069cc03fd3301b9ecf08613fae8cebb7ac4","c9d2b98ed844959947f87b8655dc36a7d632c0fa","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","5a11bfe1ad2a2d202255596bd866cefce085a186","70c920843b9d9a4865e022b73f38dd16bfe685fb","8451c2812a1476d3e13f2a509139322cc0adb1a2","796dc41ae2dbb31e5758cae3c62894100610c92b","1eba75ecbb4878d419298fb77f585b6e8955e8a4","03a08d7214c98e74293e8dd6dada6348d4d715c6","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","714b68efe5f81e8ec24701fc222393ed038137ac","09c162757d253a61b4b20f975cea58a1554a8917","a20b5563a99fd657c9d12422fa6b7111f95adf41","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","0876ef48e38d40992357c5baf4605e3d5d69206e"],"id":"880c25f237c1c72e1bbca5f2603511d2d8f66ba2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/880c25f237c1c72e1bbca5f2603511d2d8f66ba2","authors":[{"name":"Jérémie Rappaz","ids":["8835033"]},{"name":"Maria-Luiza Vladarean","ids":["8815875"]},{"name":"Julian McAuley","ids":["1814008"]},{"name":"Michele Catasta","ids":["1754926"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018696"}

As a result, the typical information trail that a user must follow while searching to achieve a learning goal may be an inefficient one involving unnecessarily easy or difficult content, or material that is irrelevant to actual learning progress relative to a user's existing knowledge. We address this problem by introducing a novel theoretical framework, algorithms, and empirical analysis of an information retrieval model that is optimized for learning outcomes instead of generic relevance. We do this by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates a cognitive learning model into a retrieval objective, and then give an algorithm for an efficient approximate solution to find the search results that represent the best 'training set' for a human learner. Our model can personalize results for an individual user's learning goals, as well as account for the effort required to achieve those goals for a given set of retrieval results. We investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of our retrieval framework relative to a commercial search engine baseline ('Google') through a crowdsourced user study involving a vocabulary learning task, and demonstrate the effectiveness of personalized results from our model on word learning outcomes.","inCitations":["1807e79d0efdb88f53dd56214f37f618a35eef70","50608a5f47dacfa21a7a1aa9a5df37e2c6977041","0c3faffe2c21147280e23b189cc448e24b7cef01","bfca58d69b80ead742b46298852b1205537c8c04","dea298b4ba2934a30955fc804c000750e0157ec4","77a9bf5331212676ee2c46e66e69608d35c84046","bed38665d8f565b91eafc2edd3b2c484fc7865bd","dfdfcdb7ee0f280a139ad353bffd903161f03a5a","bcb47bbf0a630838b0c27897d2ec49e4c24e3026","b4da4041ea6dbc84aa1ed6593ca51a42a0fb26b4","e781cf698b81fc7417f0ed9671b1c4577b128b4e"],"pmid":"","title":"Retrieval Algorithms Optimized for Human Learning","journalPages":"555-564","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080835"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Baseline (configuration management)","Computational model","Crowdsourcing","Data science","Information needs","Information retrieval","Mathematical optimization","Optimization problem","Personalization","Relevance","Test set","Usability testing","Vocabulary","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8d7c2404fd67574a3b07602aad90e89141eb9622","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","8e6d963a9c1115de61e7672c6d4c54c781b3e54d","a29851811df8435a8d686a9c43c912f43dc06ccc","40b42731dbb4c8ed6a03fbee44b945b55c00f19a","4d2cee58708c2d1467a683553c9d4f75b00a6b85","5abca53c6c57f5264df6e40bb5ea2f09602bf506","f7d4359b0090a775a1251e6c640701b16e25147a","dea298b4ba2934a30955fc804c000750e0157ec4","3a3679965ab4ef93409097be5898c68a51d81ea8","31c6b7b6b8a4ca6de749d874b29b07fbb2290ff5","7149d9be2c394dc48c678310af4cbf404c4cf64a","8faacb2148f97ab6e417d871ebc0614bf6fc2cc3","012927ab94f0e542ce137e032b0288bbfbc2f9ca","8a1905a3bc9071a0a111ec4029175cf5cff1b305","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7","dea266419175e64b5b543bd3b9ef11b52243f4c8","0708037f8b6af7ca166a8c53ad362de063fb9809","42771aede47980ae8eeebac246c7a8b941d11414"],"id":"abbb22faa83910e0f087c217a5a7a84ce9bcc1eb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/abbb22faa83910e0f087c217a5a7a84ce9bcc1eb","authors":[{"name":"Rohail Syed","ids":["3388401"]},{"name":"Kevyn Collins-Thompson","ids":["2582990"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080835"}

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between mobile users\u2019 implicit interest inferred from attention metrics, such as eye gaze or viewport time, and explicit interest expressed by users. We present the first quantitative gaze tracking study using front-facing camera of mobile devices instead of specialized, expensive eye-tracking devices. We focus on multi-column digital media pages in Google Play Store that display 30+ items per page belonging to diverse categories. In such pages, we find significantly different distribution of gaze metrics on items that users rate as interesting vs. not. We leverage this insight by building a prediction model that is able to infer a user\u2019s interest ratings from the the non-click actions of the user. Our model is able to attain AUC of 90.32% in predicting user interest at an individual item level. In addition, our experiments on collection item re-ranking show how user gaze and viewport signals can be used to personalize item ranking on the collection page. Beyond understanding users\u2019 attention behavior in novel contexts such as multi-column digital media pages in Google Play Store, the findings in this study have implications for the design of a novel personalization and recommendation mechanism by (1) prioritizing items that are most likely of interest to users based on historical attention signals, and (2) prioritizing positions receiving significant portion of gaze attention.","inCitations":["c350852bc3cdf37449f25cdbd1c4842408a0834b","275276c01f662dfcdea9923bc31b75d50de7fbc8","5131d7d69c57f8d1857659eec9810a843e92b115","02a6498c20b517e3fadf9445e4226bc28b5105aa"],"pmid":"","title":"Towards Measuring and Inferring User Interest from Gaze","journalPages":"525-533","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/25af/e234435ede5fd95e47c3b58ed2c1da318f46.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/www.cs.cornell.edu/~yli/papers/www17-cr.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~yli/papers/www17-cr.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054182"],"entities":["Digital media","Experiment","Eye tracking","Mobile device","Personalization","Play Store","Relevance","Viewport"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["11190a466d1085c09a11e52cc63f112280ddce74","f591c9d0210a0ecfd98b8ae4bce943d42f636cb1","dbcd79bd7edcdcbb5912a50796fc3c2746729eb5","f237e72b2d5265da4c213e3c69979395728137dc","26bb234091d596bd431e8a924931ad219c067ae6","8748c232a93cfe595de6938f209a170fca51c1d5","076eb1ab94744ec20e8cf34d7eba6be620dfa81e","0ca665d223375ddba1c2e13d54895ac245f2c3c1","84bd007b64d8f2d99d9bbde3a232f55da00283bc","208371961aae57d5d281b3b54716a157cb762c84","bd11602566b54dc3183af4cfede0dca914a6627b","08b48058cd560bfe02809155331f05bd77502e55","050f2c5ecdd39d261582b3e4aec8cf13c5d14ed0","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","d5c2c62baa3dac194e03afba955ba4c9db84a69d","6e633b41d93051375ef9135102d54fa097dc8cf8","280536a4c5ef27df84720118964ee7805984e4d4","44c990cdec924eedbea7d21e39452cb6b0e4f3bd","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","564049721e97ee01c4f6b315bf4c98293f1b2fa6","3453d79657e8f3e1614e73608f92465ab7f5a291","2d26fcf385ee2c4baef9150d0870836f3ff0a0f9","9c700c9cfd23753fa8630862cff2f2212b781fc8","30b335720b55fe93de970cae860d2dc23f489fc2","0df0d1adea39a5bef318b74faa37de7f3e00b452","342be3d0e7529e63d16d1b22dbddf26d63e14bd6"],"id":"25afe234435ede5fd95e47c3b58ed2c1da318f46","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/25afe234435ede5fd95e47c3b58ed2c1da318f46","authors":[{"name":"Yixuan Li","ids":["7769997"]},{"name":"Pingmei Xu","ids":["2366042"]},{"name":"Dmitry Lagun","ids":["2568110"]},{"name":"Vidhya Navalpakkam","ids":["2575582"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054182"}

Against the backdrop of this research, a basic question has received comparatively little attention: how desirable are cascades on a social media platform from the point of view of users? While versions of this question have been considered from the perspective of the producers of cascades, any answer to this question must also take into account the effect of cascades on their audience \u2014 the viewers of the cascade who do not directly participate in generating the content that launched it. In this work, we seek to fill this gap by providing a consumer perspective of information cascades. Users on social and information networks play the dual role of producers and consumers, and our work focuses on how users perceive cascades as consumers. Starting from this perspective, we perform an empirical study of the interaction of Twitter users with retweet cascades. We measure how often users observe retweets in their home timeline, and observe a phenomenon that we term the Impressions Paradox: the share of impressions for cascades of size k decays much more slowly than frequency of cascades of size k. Thus, the audience for cascades can be quite large even for rare large cascades. We also measure audience engagement with retweet cascades in comparison to non-retweeted or organic content. Our results show that cascades often rival or exceed organic content in engagement received per impression. This result is perhaps surprising in that consumers didn\u2019t opt in to see tweets from these authors. Furthermore, although cascading content is widely popular, one would expect it to eventually reach parts of the audience that may not be interested in the content. Motivated by the tension in these empirical findings, we posit a simple theoretical model that focuses on the effect of cascades on the audience (rather than the cascade producers).

In particular, the results suggest that together these two effects enable the audience to consume a high quality stream of content in the presence of cascades.","inCitations":["842a02228f07954b95714f5fa0c5991781ae8302"],"pmid":"","title":"Cascades: A View from Audience","journalPages":"587-596","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/11f9/82ece8604edcba03e96c4de07626ecdc2f77.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06673v2.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052647","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06673v3.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p587.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06673","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06673v1.pdf"],"entities":["Backdrop CMS","Display resolution","Expect","Information cascade","Multimedia framework","Paradox (database)","Reblogging","Relevance","Social media","Theory","Timeline","WWW","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["21aae3d9e624ebda090f7af1410c4ea10476001d","0e1ebbf27b303b8ccf62176e6e9370261963e2c0","c8665198592b52ba122e5cf84032a9bc1c61eade","01d5e4482c4fa7c8c4dd9a40783efc79fa7640af","0609bc949c221948ded85d2fa7c64146ee53283b","f4b52788278bdfea71c55dea1a82c41845a98fbb","3d3c82d8989b0053da3fc7b0598cb72457442fd1","11971e428132ade5439f77eea258140302865ad7","12f806ec40bc0d4199fe90867195397b7a41a22a","1b6ad49fc77144180463d5c51c6bfe19c0111a6f","1073c29baf6d9cfc7b7b028024b58ed070696da3","897391c58a60d3e33697e3486800dbb5183d2b65","9aae36efd2da7ae3a8279067cee3d45e216f6899","c5d7763707d3504f0dec73c39424ec688b8692a3","5045d1e1204d754e9cae6d999f1fc03f7d990575","08bf35375abf366869446bb33dab26fd95303ff3","039c32e41d5f583b737decb2e269ab6cb840c1e5","bb49c8eae3054c0cbba4f1b5c011440eb51c1796"],"id":"00083980e04f7d901a20912e4777f343e686f467","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/00083980e04f7d901a20912e4777f343e686f467","authors":[{"name":"Rahmtin Rotabi","ids":["2330620"]},{"name":"Krishna Kamath","ids":["40382581"]},{"name":"Jon M.

To combat such deadly epidemic, there is an urgent need for novel tools and methodologies to gain new insights into the behavioral processes of opioid abuse and addiction. The role of social media in biomedical knowledge mining has turned into increasingly significant in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoDOA to automatically detect the opioid addicts from Twitter, which can potentially assist in sharpening our understanding toward the behavioral process of opioid abuse and addiction. In AutoDOA, to model the users and posted tweets as well as their rich relationships, a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) is first constructed. Then meta-path based approach is used to formulate similarity measures over users and different similarities are aggregated using Laplacian scores. Based on HIN and the combined meta-path, to reduce the cost of acquiring labeled examples for supervised learning, a transductive classification model is built for automatic opioid addict detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply transductive classification in HIN into drug-addiction domain. Comprehensive experiments on real sample collections from Twitter are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system AutoDOA in opioid addict detection by comparisons with other alternate methods. The results and case studies also demonstrate that knowledge from daily-life social media data mining could support a better practice of opioid addiction prevention and treatment.","inCitations":["d8b96b98cd36bcbc94b0ffd4049305d62fbee7ea","ceb31d66061422ade518ee61f9efabdcb4f8e8f8","97dca3ef15503dbf94bba18fcde28db07eaee16c","124906f9673924c85c31e26a577ae319b2495857"],"pmid":"","title":"Social Media for Opioid Addiction Epidemiology: Automatic Detection of Opioid Addicts from Twitter and Case Studies","journalPages":"1259-1267","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132857"],"entities":["Data mining","Experiment","Similarity measure","Social media","Supervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","de481259aeccffd2dbdcea8c4e9fa0ab8cd32c8b","5abf1c0ff7dc9157aedd9dfa021f8d3dcc647d9b","2011feb353fed560b0643dc9db6528317c643957","a47adcc6f6428a57bcbdc1d98b9a20cd7d75e0b2","784220a5a2ad452282f8af006a6cb5715d54d0ed","0fc2dcc4d56bd76e892d24f1121a8824e0deae8c","15b2c44b3868a1055850846161aaca59083e0529","9f7f5dad0fd0bd03050fc68176b859bc9f8f0b2b","268d9b973e823e7fdff6b2aab1695191cf8965d5","20dc1890ca65e01856f31edf10126c2ad67e9d04","1a3802bf5afe8cf0b8a6b957cb993136077bdc3c","07c44c676f9ed88c4c2cab2f257615d632c56ec7","d8b7a36933881312a6ce24e9a91be15cffcb5e3b","5abf6519803ce2195f57efd109e1f40fae86b880","bb24c9661655035a1e61cce7f2084075b6fa1194","10f272220cbca311c8379a72f9d5ba387b18c437","409b0cce867d59c941f40c66306400c32f2aaac2","001926513f4fefa454b3d926bc3b35cf38ccc689","13fae98c8f6502b8585a276d19bf29b85d09dc27","02485a373142312c354b79552b3d326913eaf86d","2f3fe6e7b7387ac6b96b122fafb8b423219b7516","fd4a23990114bb86c149c35c0feff5c055cd9c11","981d47b75e47d1efabba8d6edf1f55c72f493dd1","f22ae66b083183494f2ab0f5c7758fb03d69b05c","57da56f9753d173cfc84f85827944bdace5b5064"],"id":"e3adb12fbd126ce9abbbec86c6ac1642e61ded34","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e3adb12fbd126ce9abbbec86c6ac1642e61ded34","authors":[{"name":"Yujie Fan","ids":["2549310"]},{"name":"Yiming Zhang","ids":["1908353"]},{"name":"Yanfang Ye","ids":["7873409"]},{"name":"Xin Li","ids":["1685323"]},{"name":"Wanhong Zheng","ids":["2099300"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132857"}

For instance, a document which is not directly related to the user's query may still contain relevant information. In this scenario, an option is to define an intermediate class collecting ambiguous instances. Yet some natural questions arise. Is this annotation strategy convenient? how should the intermediate class be treated? To answer these questions, we explored two community question answering datasets whose comments were originally annotated with three classes. We re-annotated a subset of instances considering a binary good vs bad setting. Our main contribution is to show empirically that the inclusion of an intermediate class to assess Boolean relevance is not useful. Moreover, in case the data is already annotated with a 3-class strategy, the instances from the intermediate class can be safely removed at training time.","inCitations":["fb3831558390c0649cb9f7c7f6dbcc026aedf39f"],"pmid":"","title":"On the Use of an Intermediate Class in Boolean Crowdsourced Relevance Annotations for Learning to Rank Comments","journalPages":"1209-1212","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080763"],"entities":["Crowdsourcing","Information retrieval","Learning to rank","Question answering","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","b8e32a0f57c36b5bb33adee13143a78eec8a8a59","735786a00d50373434d50f8c82889abbcdc8ea12","803c790380cf54a5da78b0afc26a458fb03c21b7","2ae7aa1572cb39539b9b4c558f2bd7836cae151c","4d1c66d4c75e2a4ee53bb5593496d20ea13c295c","90185c774a34bbbb303e58cbc7cd1cd16c6862bd","32b0e58be4914e7c655dcce533a19f20daee6cc5","e0a1c613ed7297dd7b6fc7b031341e66285beacc","45cf7ea736444e2fefc0ccbaf598abd110fabf0d","37103f25abef8ba4cbd855dc16965f2934082a71","3283270044b5818bb43a6470776644e7738282f9","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","9a7b75c6f1cbe0ac184cf5d598ef85070d52c327","9459f2b522ecb8638b2a0d27b07a743cbfa9391c"],"id":"ac08513b2af0bf7faa73fdfb2e0c99a225cbf289","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ac08513b2af0bf7faa73fdfb2e0c99a225cbf289","authors":[{"name":"Alberto Barrón-Cedeño","ids":["2839105"]},{"name":"Giovanni Da San Martino","ids":["34086979"]},{"name":"Simone Filice","ids":["2778426"]},{"name":"Alessandro Moschitti","ids":["1719404"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080763"}

{"doiUrl":"","venue":"International Semantic Web Conference","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2017,"paperAbstract":"Preparing a comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased report on a given topic or question is a challenging task. The first step is often a daunting discovery task that requires searching through an overwhelming number of information sources without introducing bias from the analyst\u2019s current knowledge or limitations of the information sources. A common requirement for many analysis reports is a deep understanding of various kinds of historical and ongoing events that are reported in the media. To enable better analysis based on events, there exist several event databases containing structured representations of events extracted from news articles. Examples include GDELT [4], ICEWS [1], and EventRegistry [3]. These event databases have been successfully used to perform various kinds of analysis tasks, e.g., forecasting societal events [6]. However, there has been little work on the discovery aspect of the analysis, that results in a gap between the information requirements and the available data, and potentially a biased view of the available information. In this presentation, we describe a framework for concept discovery over event databases using semantic technologies. Unlike existing concept discovery solutions that perform discovery over text documents and in isolation from the remaining data analysis tasks [5, 8], our goal is providing a unified solution that allows deep understanding of the same data that will be used to perform other analysis tasks (e.g., hypothesis generation [7] or building models for forecasting [2]). Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system. The system takes in as input a set of event databases and RDF knowledge bases and provides as output a set of APIs that provide a unified retrieval mechanism over input data and knowledge bases, and an interface to a number of concept discovery algorithms. Figures 2 shows different portions of our system\u2019s UI that is built using our concept discovery framework APIs. The analyst can enter a natural language question or a set of concepts, and retrieve collections of relevant concepts identified and ranked using different concept discovery algorithms. A key aspect of our framework is the use of semantic technologies.

Typically, language models estimate the probability of a document generating the query, where the query is considered as a set of independent search terms. We extend this approach by considering the concepts implied by both the query and words in the document. The model combines the probability of the document generating the concept embodied by the query, and the traditional language model probability of the document generating the query terms. We use a word embedding space to express concepts. The similarity between two vectors in this space is estimated using a weighted cosine distance. The weighting significantly enhances the discrimination between vectors. We evaluate our model on benchmark datasets (TREC 6\u20138) and empirically demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.","inCitations":["e9302c3fee03abb5dd6e134118207272c1dcf303"],"pmid":"","title":"A Concept Language Model for Ad-hoc Retrieval","journalPages":"885-886","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10038480/1/p885-zou.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054209","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p885.pdf"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Cosine similarity","Hoc (programming language)","Information retrieval","Language model","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","82ff2dce7215b17128ff07752d221028e97f5a66","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","55350454ca7d41f0a5c900bccbe4d0225986281e","0ef311acf523d4d0e2cc5f747a6508af2c89c5f7","4e3571c4d195381518dfced7c36a78b581041737","543a68fcc4d48726abdef66a2befcd23f154eb3a","3d819ddfd6d4eef1afcc5ef61b58f4eba650dd98"],"id":"414bbbb9806aecd41699f9577a2128c4fa1e3576","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/414bbbb9806aecd41699f9577a2128c4fa1e3576","authors":[{"name":"Vasileios Lampos","ids":["3006026"]},{"name":"Shangsong Liang","ids":["3279808"]},{"name":"Zhaochun Ren","ids":["2780667"]},{"name":"Emine Yılmaz","ids":["35466594"]},{"name":"Ingemar J.

{"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3018661.3018702","venue":"WSDM","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2017,"paperAbstract":"The majority of online display ads are served through real-time bidding (RTB) --- each ad display impression is auctioned off in real-time when it is just being generated from a user visit. To place an ad automatically and optimally, it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition, we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation using neural networks. The empirical study on two large-scale real-world datasets and the live A/B testing on a commercial platform have demonstrated the superior performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":["4935d8b156056ebbaad20b0d5b7513c51b09ef63","288cad86878c91fff91726511e65e8b9580346d9","fce142e0f5baab16d31a1e9e26b001d0e9aefd5e","e5cb7660cd4f76d5b5dfc2cdca026f57c4d4ec81","a27e3a48b806d07b472cc9e74c518a7b2cfdf272","84e65a5bdb735d62eef4f72c2f01af354b2285ba","255149101465960b3968ee00dd3f647ea4cf309a","f7f72159906791189ad5c239aca39d453c183016","d1cad90baf882cc125dc0b8f51624fc5fff94508","99f046089586f3fa192915737a96b77bd989a76f","1567397f4427bfc424694d893b076d23df29acd4","f82b828acec613d4c574541eaea0eba2dd8bc117","7b951066b906d5e1e1df38d85811fd26f7e478cd","1a8192f0476084c6033b87fc059e585302145eef","3cbd8acd2529f866c550b56973b32a8a28a48d78","92df4b85574ad6007138c75b3238913dd288ad72","b6c707af4af5c5e29ebce8d369f5d5e87703aa73","ec363d9a88d45b3be26d8cffcb36fc517347741e","1327ebf224f0ab0716a2dddc50685bc44eff4cf3","8c8ab1f3e8de3a0079e9a55922da4eee82f0e994","396d7ea95b9d44965c90256631954fd340eb731f","6987b944bd0f6f7da72ff3b434d05c351ae26377","0a56be9385783d2ca57406083bccc4078144d4ce","140c79cdcbb4b075c7ce2210422d4ead13f4a09e","f3321ce9fd2841ba9ec4e14fcb6337c9923a80fe"],"pmid":"","title":"Real-Time Bidding by Reinforcement Learning in Display Advertising","journalPages":"661-670","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02490","http://wnzhang.net/papers/rlb.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018702","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02490v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02490v2.pdf"],"entities":["A/B testing","Algorithm","Approximation","Artificial neural network","Display advertising","Markov chain","Markov decision process","Mathematical optimization","Optimization problem","Real-time bidding","Real-time clock","Real-time transcription","Reinforcement learning","Scalability","State space"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1e06ef68559a8496650008a8ebbd41a47b1ec89e","5b8d44acc28ee24e5efb6337f78002b212383b30","47b4904001f4bcde5088a5c8a4ad2a18364d64c0","f167390a2a11b7026671bb0e7008cf757fb541ce","37835b068408f71e8277f7426c71dc622272e026","0667b9b284fc06cdf7ee2775ccf8a88f8989c4a2","06de5545b5d5532bd710b55623155d0ff0b188cb","dd90dee12840f4e700d8146fb111dbc863a938ad","0c4edc609f977cefb305f76a991514a83f8088e3","83869fca86cc17ddac99fb6c0dbe8c5796539758","355a30d7116edc6901c4877fe5c393d73397887e","34ddb4d6b98a45b24b9645b5c52b1d3424ba24f5","2088c55ec3e52a8be99cd933907020c70b281383","243299756524a541630c95375a4528eb1ae30068","11b4e9167af55d5bd570398b743bd62ac27aaf44","5776373e3e6c3a619252e2c132b5a4414d6c2271","3cdfc29af1b16a33d99e5912c539b2ca66053d80","1ff88585ce3fd5fdaab6573722d4874641359951","9eed333dcaade2c1dd32590eff6b0c0e670a5674","b3091fc2e74f56e9b73805ea1a76dbbaa9baf74c","769587883887e1327073eb7f13536f7ae8762c56","0c4003d43aeed0e77f58286bb3746eae29b32405","187f3f984e6f375178f41827ab90c4e748773fa7","daf9ed5dc6c6bad5367d7fd8561527da30e9b8dd","639f31ea8fe484e891705758f9b58870f46084fa","30c6f7725bcd1502ac9de22eb1cfc66426b2855b"],"id":"319847506a5714659e0dcb9e447df96e48cb717d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/319847506a5714659e0dcb9e447df96e48cb717d","authors":[{"name":"Han Cai","ids":["1936602"]},{"name":"Kan Ren","ids":["38824987"]},{"name":"Weinan Zhang","ids":["8031058"]},{"name":"Kleanthis Malialis","ids":["2228452"]},{"name":"Jun Wang","ids":["39055225"]},{"name":"Yong Yu","ids":["1811427"]},{"name":"Defeng Guo","ids":["2914928"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018702"}

Most existing approaches use shallow models and only work on static networks by extracting local or global topology information of each node as the algorithm input. It is challenging for such approaches to learn a desirable node representation on incomplete graphs with a large number of missing links or on dynamic graphs with new nodes joining in. It is even challenging for them to deeply fuse other types of data such as node properties into the learning process to help better represent the nodes with insufficient links. In this paper, we for the first time study the problem of network embedding on incomplete networks. We propose a Multi-View Correlation-learning based Deep Network Embedding method named MVC-DNE to incorporate both the network structure and the node properties for more effectively and efficiently perform network embedding on incomplete networks. Specifically, we consider the topology structure of the network and the node properties as two correlated views. The insight is that the learned representation vector of a node should reflect its characteristics in both views. Under a multi-view correlation learning based deep autoencoder framework, the structure view and property view embeddings are integrated and mutually reinforced through both self-view and cross-view learning. As MVC-DNE can learn a representation mapping function, it can directly generate the representation vectors for the new nodes without retraining the model. Thus it is especially more efficient than previous methods. Empirically, we evaluate MVC-DNE over three real network datasets on two data mining applications, and the results demonstrate that MVC-DNE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":["df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","b0e2ff4fe0dc5c58cd20ba875826e5bcb15d5afb","4f938616f65a8fec534e7782a53a9426a3bd3c90","c1edc6dc088b8860bfb440822c8e2fc769e9970e"],"pmid":"","title":"From Properties to Links: Deep Network Embedding on Incomplete Graphs","journalPages":"367-376","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132975"],"entities":["Algorithm","Autoencoder","Data mining","Deep learning","Global optimization","Model\u2013view\u2013controller","Time and motion study"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27208c88f07a1ffe97760c12be08fad3ab68fee2","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","0026402e608d2d212e571536cd1d160b310ed0d8","50681b5f3666bc730986263fde588c5000e93874","b7b00080f83e5b65a10bb07c0a7091e746c3a57e","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","0ce8879ea7fc0e96fd0e4e242a46002010f86e18","1871ea4cf23441d0297c99d9115f664a6ba0efda","87c8eccb221db9f33fdf9c8a6a17498e18045b4a","26742aa25a2790558f840b9551fb1babc4f9e03a","71b64035eacf2986ca7c153ebec72eb781a23931","d3e0d596efd9d19b93d357565a68dfa925dce2bb","d54b45bb99699021cac4b770eded6e80105a2ef6","75d663b9d6a492b4c5a466f9ba2dfa06fc450d6e","fc60f2e1147d754911334f4ba88ce9d92a535990","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","20739c96ed44ccfdc5352ea38e1a2a15137363f4","1eb6538c7fa6a41923869924a55c95036f06c9a0","c2fd72cb2a77941e655b5d949d0d59b01e173c3b","745782902e97be8fbacd1e05d283f11104e2fec6","2bf3fb9d50a39ad727f248ffd4b14f07a2d48e4a","d0b7c8828f0fca4dd901674e8fb5bd464a187664","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","11540131eae85b2e11d53df7f1360eeb6476e7f4","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef"],"id":"f428b0bfec203194c7473e7d83a8e50b222417dd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f428b0bfec203194c7473e7d83a8e50b222417dd","authors":[{"name":"Dejian Yang","ids":["9716975"]},{"name":"Senzhang Wang","ids":["3210262"]},{"name":"Chaozhuo Li","ids":["2869810"]},{"name":"Xiaoming Zhang","ids":["46447760"]},{"name":"Zhoujun Li","ids":["1707275"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132975"}

However, social media are also extremely important in the context of planned events, such as fairs, exhibits, festivals, as they play an essential role in communicating them to fans, interest groups, and the general population. These kinds of events are geo-localized within a city or territory and are scheduled within a public calendar. We consider a specific scenario, the Milano Fashion Week (MFW), which is an important event in our city. We focus our attention on the coverage of social content in space, measuring the propagation of the event in the territory. We build different clusters of fashion brands, we characterize several features of propagation in space and we correlate them to the popularity of involved actors. We show that the clusters along space and popularity dimensions are loosely correlated, and that domain experts are typically able to understand and identify only popularity aspects, while they are completely unaware of spatial dynamics of social media response to the events.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Spatial Analysis of Social Media Response to Live Events: The Case of the Milano Fashion Week","journalPages":"1457-1462","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0976/c357cee87e7828d54147033077b908362be8.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1457.pdf","http://www.floriandaniel.it/papers/LcWb02-brambillaA.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3041021.3051698"],"entities":["Geotagging","Instagram","Rare events","Social media","Social network","Software propagation","Spatial analysis"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a59af8e31918f78eae03d20e7f6481d074fc087","113a0a371f8572bc8f8adab9ba8d126be8eebaa1","e7be53022829bfeaf4b8216d1576794ae34c67e0","84bffe8afd1c16ec2dc8eab3a6b9203f2473d6bc","2fc061117e3aace54aaac7f2e26bf1767e79d015","189d2ee0d8ad9224da7240dcf085b2b79af6d1c9","2cb4e13a761642ed2a6d9cac08468cadb1cd96ff","0b65f3e1037255693e7fdc4cacf43e43dd1b1685","1f7920081917a74575e7d348d0fd063150e66cd7","d76db77ca0a1b06f8a59a101441f17a891e52e28","191a68115ec23f8ee2f39940dac000dd7a3f4039"],"id":"0976c357cee87e7828d54147033077b908362be8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0976c357cee87e7828d54147033077b908362be8","authors":[{"name":"Marco Brambilla","ids":["1720147"]},{"name":"Stefano Ceri","ids":["1705257"]},{"name":"Florian Daniel","ids":["1797572"]},{"name":"Gianmarco Donetti","ids":["10305519"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3051698"}

This is also called real-time bidding (RTB) and the ad displaying process ensures that the publisher's benefit is maximized or there is an equilibrium in ad auctions. However, the benefits of the other two stakeholders - the advertiser and the user - have been rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational framework that selects a banner ad based on the optimized trade-offs among all stakeholders. The first stage is still auction based and the second stage re-ranks ads by considering the benefits of all stakeholders. Our metric variables are: the publisher's revenue, the advertiser's utility, the ad memorability, the ad click-through rate (CTR), the contextual relevance, and the visual saliency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that optimizes trade-offs among all stakeholders in RTB by incorporating multimedia metrics. An algorithm is also proposed to determine the optimal weights of the metric variables. We use both ad auction datasets and multimedia datasets to validate the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the publisher can significantly improve the other stakeholders' benefits by slightly reducing her revenue in the short-term. In the long run, advertisers and users will be more engaged, the increased demand of advertising and the increased supply of page views can then boost the publisher's revenue.","inCitations":["4155365ea340f5d2939c6f32c1385e6246c28919"],"pmid":"","title":"Optimizing Trade-offs Among Stakeholders in Real-Time Bidding by Incorporating Multimedia Metrics","journalPages":"205-214","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10642","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3077136.3080802","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/159032/1/159032.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10642v3.pdf"],"entities":["Auction algorithm","Display advertising","Feasible region","Mathematical optimization","Optimizing compiler","Page view","Real-time bidding","Real-time clock","Relevance","Web banner","Web page"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["876bfee8b66b8940d6ca43f1f448f8f82d606807","1b4523aa07fc0dab565a45c55009de963053942c","ae7d5d50fc1d11aff59f910c3b37d7ee6415ee51","0862546afcd8cd40af6e149eda82e832d2b9868d","8af63cd129217c2264845f4d71180e4a8ab0d754","8c087fe26314a8f9327fb9382e2e6aa7d99f9bda","2ef4ec21347c457dcedef334d7a54e5cb0545ca9","6fb5142dc60256ad0cea7051be23fb94eb27ccc0","59e8a0371a8cdaf24cdc3e3c0f5e7e6f2d6a1251","2286315e1787519c14617a85fe633b8080b30ea9","26346f47a1d2b74216de9b64e544e4f195d408a6","5ccf2ede4bb17bac118a6bb47a0583f3c55e68d2","2ed346d7bc09b6151f6a2b1910a6817c822d72db","270536a38fe2e901e676eafc914235979c3a6462","2834899017d814886679f378858ba52d34ee6ddd","53993c7fabf631cbd8a44ab3e42c6bdf784db456","4f92339b2624fae5b4dfbaa85cad326f380af83a","2cd6252dbe666b7c17957e396f31df5c766c426a","1a2931a234e41034f78321dba216828eb8feddff","d3972d4285c48ec17f4bb59fbf412acef5233291","970628d3fcbae58a787c5a50523e93ecf8d212e7","6d55be7a6fcbf760f9c32548afddb313606598c8","8fbe262bf0e83766f6985e25e2af851ea5cec66b","81e8916b9d4eeb47c2e96c823b36d032b244842f","bfc214ce7ab5b101425e5cabd631176bb427adff","4e937d0372eb356ab64b47c6e140ad1dc729a0d6","1cea62d9d9436fe78ed83676a7102a46a7f5446b","2092f0f1adaee50ed247216a1cfab7016add37f5","89b2facea4c73aea089d37b0782d7e9156145be5","0df68ccc83e7b879282c4a89100661fb2194a207","1134280b51cb3a24be47ee98be9044414f74b718","b705f7267fc9a2b51fbe124328d8985dabe85c04"],"id":"3f34fe30f4ddb69bf7f886fa78dcf7bcd4d930bd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3f34fe30f4ddb69bf7f886fa78dcf7bcd4d930bd","authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","ids":["46772865"]},{"name":"Bowei Chen","ids":["47440000"]},{"name":"Mohan S.

In this study, we develop theoretical results for both the cosine and the GMM (generalized min-max) kernel [26], which is a generalization of the resemblance. GMM has direct applications in machine learning as a positive definite kernel and can be efficiently linearized via probabilistic hashing to handle big data. Owing to its discrete nature, the hashed values can also be used to build hash tables for efficient near neighbor search. We prove the theoretical limit of GMM and the consistency result, assuming that the data follow an elliptical distribution, which is a general family of distributions and includes the multivariate normal and t-distribution as special cases. The consistency result holds as long as the data have bounded first moment (an assumption which typically holds for data commonly encountered in practice). Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic normality of GMM. We also prove the limit of cosine under elliptical distributions. In comparison, the consistency of GMM requires much weaker conditions. For example, when data follow a t-distribution with ν degrees of freedom, GMM typically provides a better estimate of similarity than cosine when ν < 8 (ν = 8 means the distribution is very close to normal). These theoretical results help explain the recent success of GMM and lay the foundation for further research.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Theory of the GMM Kernel","journalPages":"1053-1062","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3514/8db40af14071f8e9728d53e9565a63634568.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00550v1.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1053.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00550v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052679","http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00550"],"entities":["Big data","Binary data","Data mining","Google Map Maker","Hash table","Kernel (operating system)","Machine learning","Maxima and minima","Probabilistic automaton","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["45a916500ce98c8d018c13de4c1d5c53130e8a72","eab2148de7917eb572bcbb685e3604f3ce4e132f","7f47a319c9bf0a5e0e9246354f64e52e39356c96","27ae23bb8d284a1fa8c8ab24e23a72e1836ff5cc","29b7da5511dee3615fc1d2889d7756652c551cc9","c78b54ff357bc4dfd0364980bdd047dc2bb590cf","d69a218b632051c6105cc5df97c6d7285d1bb05e","034c8c60a10d09a0b28ca929a9349cb3c0466b8b","1b20afbd2d2a349737ed3dc246e44bbdba203190","63f27307cb028f9341544fff32eceb2c3c652bf2","b6fff8b8ea77f157913986e7af53951d9fc1128e","08a075443b26746bef0feaf4e8562d02164fa3d1","a4fb3bb18245c5b9f071ee4627df76b4c147f2ce","51d4d5f46cfd5f082fcf6cb2b8d49c1e03bf1b9e","89ba1fccbf764bbc464796eb546338315c810570","3dcb00b96d3568ce03a6335540681e19fc446ee0","16a269eff648eec82d592f89d811c1f8108b12ec","267199071e71d1581e97a7a82edecb7fa99748aa","0bb7b5098d30b10422c2e52462f5152696390c3a","74bee1ebf204dba4b2da0399a25a5ac9253a824e","4a156f0ea13681c2997f46bef3718a09ac63f02d","10486f0102297696f51da9f8f7c4ded4c0c49fb3","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","551fcb42b7feb047f5405777e17658538785b679","4842b30c6357f66cab16694130d7cdc5275cf79e","0434ab8a788bbe8e02b52ab27f50564920fef900","3e69456017e04b9a0ee915e815216d314383068c","1bed3a53e7afb2429c52fbc88d52a3ca4b497779","2bbdef9ea4adf45f2543812b9964ecf3e22be008","56356f1a2da94a07066508fb6283666a1714bd1c","2e497d93d1c1aceb246408696fc5e505df7b0d9c","09ca54b68921bf881e05ac1c96e7f59bb9d2c260","17f44642b41ccb651320b87480b0e85f26d4064f","4e171856b5eac3a2bf7ebc1c243d9937b55a09bc","351df512735096126454f5d4bc8e9ae56f4cd288","02be82b6567135493b9bb51573496114465c1533","74034df1bcd0d9d89479858196d1a4e8368d3777","642816bdeeb85ca33fe39cd49ddf8c823e14d626"],"id":"35148db40af14071f8e9728d53e9565a63634568","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/35148db40af14071f8e9728d53e9565a63634568","authors":[{"name":"Ping Li","ids":["50492776"]},{"name":"Cun-Hui Zhang","ids":["1771912"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052679"}

The special case of triangle counting has received much attention. Getting results for 4-vertex or 5-vertex patterns is highly challenging, and there are few practical results known that can scale to massive sizes. We introduce an algorithmic framework that can be adopted to count any small pattern in a graph and apply this framework to compute exact counts for all 5-vertex subgraphs. Our framework is built on cutting a pattern into smaller ones, and using counts of smaller patterns to get larger counts. Furthermore, we exploit degree orientations of the graph to reduce runtimes even further. These methods avoid the combinatorial explosion that typical subgraph counting algorithms face. We prove that it suffices to enumerate only four specific subgraphs (three of them have less than 5 vertices) to exactly count all 5-vertex patterns. We perform extensive empirical experiments on a variety of real-world graphs. We are able to compute counts of graphs with tens of millions of edges in minutes on a commodity machine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical algorithm for 5-vertex pattern counting that runs at this scale. A stepping stone to our main algorithm is a fast method for counting all 4-vertex patterns. This algorithm is typically ten times faster than the state of the art 4-vertex counters.","inCitations":["feeece1276e3ff6abedd286747a2ebe5de7619c8","c238b00f0936ffc44aee240fba0473b4fb421005","509936bc36fd3323a4344823f71ef1beef583ca5","062b23a1960f765060cf8ddef028617adc5a0f93","54d8b5eed9ca1fadd0e77c641388050febf7ed6e","3671dd87f820e6691c1207613dcdc0877a47d9f0","b4b603ff71a77a19c357adb8b9b5fdb48597d7d6","b06c0a57b7f8222afd77c65dcd332e277921d50d","b20cbdaa0192174cdf6397ed1f91d15742246796","51818e18536ec131ad7cda06d326a2d7905a29f5","81d129a3366ab514b3e17cfebd375320194dec6a","4d165dfda84628763e698aaf3c1f249d3952afe3","93b3e09f38407022774a664e36c935fed72c9888","add8a51fb75041e5f95457447088ce07be54d561","02a1dde72f0b932055936b9cd43619df6a43fa0a","b396d5614f8864a21b7c2bfd1e7abab5d2e01a39","36f168eda4c6090de1e309b0935bc441cc032a60","fe69891ccbca5e18587dd0e0c0b48b836ae38848","fbff99ff318abc37e0bd238bdf44ac62a10b4e79","5564ead89fcbb01472d4b243575f77f5ca7b647c","43f0f9ca613cf61823e1a86485b5992ed51b4c4b","5e1f5834f0a4b3e1da3b3173eb114f7678ba8732","35a63de782be59962c41462701aa37443508a425","0649ec40a153c6c31ec6005e927908ace747a2a0","49bab785d8a7a7a78bc71cce860acacaba111ab4"],"pmid":"","title":"ESCAPE: Efficiently Counting All 5-Vertex Subgraphs","journalPages":"1431-1440","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0067/3496dd1efdacce581d64238feca0c2a410d7.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09411v1.pdf","https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~sesh/escape.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052597","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1431.pdf","https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/6886-s18/lectures/lecture15-3.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09411"],"entities":["Algorithm","Bioinformatics","Enumerated type","Experiment","Induced subgraph","Social network analysis","Stepping level"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3746511ef9ba685f34ceec9a3e94795be5836953","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","14fb89b1a6601549ef0b64f4c5616832030e7d68","04fe2b1ba2cf79caef3ad683bc8b05d46be8bd71","00d89b389f112e6f4375b83b3c26acdd201717bf","de07e796c8d53c6ecc25b95565688aa9a9b5a213","56ac74bffb772b863cdd48facde72791a22f9543","a703dea598cf0d436e134fa52f99348cc5a4a8b7","11497ff7c2b0676e774da7f0fd7ca3a89828b38a","01ca726a47f92ee9ee9b8ecaf95396fbeab4b8ca","24789ad83f6d993743d26c2588cb1a0538eb34ba","7773958070264f0310945d8f4ad9d17ccf4e86db","cbce38ea34c90b8a53f35f10b2235e65fc5fe167","477e208d83d3557100aa920c992929de1ab560fe","3f5f0d675bcc97a7b8501d913193fa54de647566","ce69fde1bcc7e49dfc1a1df76426fdf287983bff","110b55a017f52abfedca220036ea129d84b7cadc","ed6eec3d32476d183d0f95c9f78b4ef3ebd6ec7c","0041adeb171b36f7ef568b6934ea3f4263163c05","14d23964de88419273079764da61cf541a8298c6","15b4d6c0661795a30165aeaeec31dc213559e57a","8c671a8bb36514ea82d0fc782553b6a1adb1fb5f","b556c545ec9bbe96904707076995f1cb637a2f53","41cc7331334c8ffa7a7b5e3d3b8a338a897f7af8","842b248fe554216215754b8520b7b800f8bc33ac","78981127cd896e0b7bd6ecf84a24648d2ac4e2ae","246dc6e35eef61bcc61b8051b42372d058ceb2b6","2d4a2593f828187244d5a2efd95b5ba48b28fd32","29df2ae51aa2f3a6cc345841c46742cda00f7bcf","289bfc1c90d7b54e1ca637ca555523f6af19c51f","0e1809aea71fcf3c19ab4257aa0150f5a7e51350","11830978703daeb7775678372558ac2a15476187","12d4ebe2727911fc18f1a6203dde2b1892057f83","02ab04b3c1531ad98589105d937823003ee6e719","0cf0c343ae17b0db4b5564b22480aa0415ef61af","1d74d687817dc445b8f67dbfc95e490d3d5d5599","8b4ad89c3440c9e29e2e3ee885dbb27a258b75a8","22c3c0fe4b9285d611f52d89e9debafb670819fd","043b87f2150aa95ca1f05574ae97f2a15a6add4e","350bdb162f1a02791db10ad887b84fdf231c92e5","677b78d89b626ddbc8de190f49e07b96f2cb71c1","9b90cb4aea40677494e4a3913878e355c4ae56e8","a4e5cf9078f7222347633c0370e61b3d9c624d0d","437a492ddaf7a68a4634036897f528e2c9dbc349","0f3fd2233b51ec5cbbb46451f1f76996d7493450","12c320c76d8d7bf51958b01f4c0cafd864d35654","370420c7e4019d1d261462e39dc07b70f09f48b9","06e7afa5f735fbc919201942f624302475330027","ca866a27cd07555a0027d92663421869d0ae4439","7c2963f7029451f2b8154468fcaacd0f60da1071","316180912d984e64fc1a1ae9d5e09380d993b23a","0eaf38cd3d7c7fb456201d59b6d28b084010d358","6ea8894ef9edf31ed83e925a5650a0a8f0b79b76","39348c10c90be968357e2a6b65d5e0e479307735","196d2ccd6930f52d40b88d42cad09014718bc064"],"id":"00673496dd1efdacce581d64238feca0c2a410d7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/00673496dd1efdacce581d64238feca0c2a410d7","authors":[{"name":"Ali Pinar","ids":["1745160"]},{"name":"Seshadhri Comandur","ids":["3294930"]},{"name":"Vaidyanathan Vishal","ids":["3205830"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052597"}

We present results of a study of 40 participants, each working on two different journalism tasks, which investigated how their search behaviors could indicate their intentions.

In crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, rewards also play an important part in influencing project success. Designing rewards consisting of the appropriate items is a challenging yet crucial task for the project creators. However, prior research has not considered the strategies project creators take to offer and bundle the rewards, making it hard to study the impact of reward designs on project success. In this paper, we raise a novel research question: understanding project creators' decisions of reward designs to level their chance to succeed. We approach this by modeling the design behavior of project creators, and identifying the behaviors that lead to project success. We propose a probabilistic generative model, Menu-Offering-Bundle (MOB) model, to capture the offering and bundling decisions of project creators based on collected data of 14K crowdfunding projects and their 149K reward bundles across a half-year period.

Using deep learning frameworks, such as Torch and Tensorflow, CNN can be efficiently computed by leveraging the power of GPU. However, one drawback of GPU is its limited memory which prohibits us from handling large images. Passing a 4K resolution image to the VGG network will result in an exception of out-of-memory for Titan-X GPU. In this paper, we propose a new approach that adopts the BSP (bulk synchronization parallel) model to compute CNNs for images of any size. Before fed to a specific CNN layer, the image is split into smaller pieces which go through the neural network separately. Then, a specific padding and normalization technique is adopted to merge sub-images back into one image. Our approach can be easily extended to support distributed multi-GPUs. In this paper, we use neural style network as our example to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. We show that using one Titan-X GPU, we can transfer the style of an image with 10,000×10,000 pixels within 1 minute.","inCitations":["b9559815293200ef9566cf679b5c5dd478769f82"],"pmid":"","title":"A New Approach to Compute CNNs for Extremely Large Images","journalPages":"39-48","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132872"],"entities":["4K resolution","Artificial neural network","Computation","Computer vision","Convolution","Convolutional neural network","Database normalization","Deep learning","Experiment","Face detection","Graphics processing unit","Out of memory","Outline of object recognition","Padding (cryptography)","Performance","Pixel","TensorFlow","Titan Rain","Torch"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["77c512cbb832436e1a35ad434e6bb3d763799763","1827de6fa9c9c1b3d647a9d707042e89cf94abf0","b0aca3e7877c3c20958b0fae5cbf2dd602104859","7246777c1ec550a91301772040fa0534893f9465","3ba79761192aa4bddd3342db03aa8187516c0fab","14318685b5959b51d0f1e3db34643eb2855dc6d9","915c4bb289b3642489e904c65a47fa56efb60658","31ad6a97942caa3bc4929becbc85f60eadfa9552","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","8dc550724c004daaa5a12ddf02ab06b54303eb7b","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","b0e0ccb48dd027253140e0992e8bddf605672974","043afbd936c95d0e33c4a391365893bd4102f1a7","0626908dd710b91aece1a81f4ca0635f23fc47f3","23d14ab0f18fa881a2ac8ae027be6b9f2c91d74d","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","6de2b1058c5b717878cce4e7e50d3a372cc4aaa6","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d"],"id":"511dadaefbbe2b2e31991f0d28f74ff560e222e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/511dadaefbbe2b2e31991f0d28f74ff560e222e1","authors":[{"name":"Sai Wu","ids":["1765710"]},{"name":"Mengdan Zhang","ids":["2516588"]},{"name":"Gang Chen","ids":["48390827"]},{"name":"Ke Chen","ids":["38429669"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132872"}

All these causal relations are usually in medical literature, forum and clinical cases and compose the core part of medical diagnosis. Therefore, mining these causal knowledge to predict disease and recommend therapy is of great value for assisting patients and professionals.\n The task of mining these causal knowledge for diagnosis assistance can be decomposed into four constitutes: (1) mining medical causality from text; (2) medical treatment effectiveness measurement; (3) disease prediction and (4) explicable medical treatment recommendation. However, these tasks have never been systemically studied before. For my PhD thesis, I plan to formally define the problem of mining medical domain causality for diagnosis assistance and propose methods to solve this problem.\n 1. Ming these textual causalities can be very useful for discovering new knowledge and making decisions. Many studies have been done for causal extraction from the text [1, 4, 5]. However, all these studies are based on pattern or causal triggers, which greatly limit their power to extract causality and rarely consider the frequency of co-occurrence and contextual semantic features. Besides, none of them take the transitivity rules of causality leading to reject those causalities which can be easily get by simple inference. Therefore, we formally define the task of mining causality via frequency of event co-occurrence, semantic distance between event pairs and transitivity rules of causality, and present a factor graph to combine these three resources for causality mining.\n 2. Treatment effectiveness analysis is usually taken as a subset of causal analysis on observational data. For such real observational data, PSM and RCM are two dominant methods. On one hand, it is usually difficult for PSM to find the matched cases due to the sparsity of symptom. On the other hand, we should check every possible (symptom, treatment) pair by exploiting RCM, leading to make the characteristic of exploding up, especially when we want to check the causal relation between a combination of symptoms and a combination of drugs. Besides, the larger number of symptom or treatment in the combination the less number of patient case retrieved, which lead to the lack of statistical significance. Specifically, patients tend to take tens of herbs as the treatment each time in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Therefore, how to evaluate the effectiveness of herbs separately and jointly is really a big challenge. This is also a very fundamental research topic supporting many downstream applications.\n 3. Both hospitals and on-line forums have accumulated sheer amount of records, such as clinical text data and online diagnosis Q&A pairs. The availability of such data in large volume enables automatic disease prediction. There are some papers on disease prediction with electronic health record (EHR) [2], but the research on disease prediction with raw symptoms is still necessary and challenging. Therefore, we propose a general new idea of using the rich contextual information of diseases and symptoms to bridge the gap of disease candidates and symptoms, and detach it from the specific way of implementing the idea using network embedding.\n 4. Recommendation in medical domain is usually a decision-making issue, which requires the ability of explaining \"why\". The ability of explaining \"why\" are basically from two paths. Consider the recommendation suggest you eat more vegetables. You probably do not believe it if there is nothing attached. But if the recommendation gives the literally reasons why eating more vegetables is good you might like to take this suggestion. Consider another scenario, if the recommendation gives you the data of the contrast which show that people who eat more vegetables are healthier than those eat less, it is certain that you also want to take this recommendation. Based on these two intuitions, we present a recommendation model based on proofs which are either literally reasons or difference from contrast.\n This work was supported by the 973 program (No. 2014CB340503) and the NSFC (No. 61133012 and No. 61472107).","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Mining Medical Causality for Diagnosis Assistance","journalPages":"841","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3022752"],"entities":["Causality","DARPA Grand Challenge","Downstream (software development)","Factor graph","Online and offline","Reliability-centered maintenance","Sparse matrix","Text corpus","Vertex-transitive graph"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c665f4a9b2ca7beb4ad4a7221e8830ea38b8d769","237153ff512c12de424bccc0399c70ef216d1a73","eb1abf686ca1a304aacc995383fd03336e095b9c","e4cc18bdc2009cc140d465c89b0cabb3addd8102"],"id":"9c58bc256a6bbe0a3bdeaeb3fe55b34293b00d6f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9c58bc256a6bbe0a3bdeaeb3fe55b34293b00d6f","authors":[{"name":"Sendong Zhao","ids":["40326824"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3022752"}

Our approach is to identify a set of additional visible seed nodes for each user. The online reachability algorithm explores the graph starting at these nodes. We first formulate the problem as asymmetric k-center with outliers, and then give an efficient and practical algorithm. We prove new theoretical guarantees for this problem and show empirically that it performs very well in practice.","inCitations":["aa24feb152a725bfa51209ca356b96cdf44d4bb6"],"pmid":"","title":"Indexing Public-Private Graphs","journalPages":"1461-1470","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9741/4ebe8af7409630e1223df8b2a651d476b899.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1461.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052683","http://theory.stanford.edu/~sergei/papers/www17-akc.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Directed graph","Metric k-center","Reachability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27cf082c7427782e2a0b3a0a872b60c3927eb63c","c2452563294a72b614a735ff0c8aac83b0e52db4","034df08528d88361c06ecfbd5dd2616b65bd9fc8","13bda7e7a6d3ae153ff1b8c546174d2bfac6c5aa","a81cc416fe1225a004e8f299978b71375e075965","6384234e698f793cfba0cbf890b1c2a2209d06b7","570dcaf3615ea8e3f26853aacaf1edbf7e596cd0","9f0cb06dd970ba981aa5989db44c6db6739204f3","737e43bd36ac3cc785915fa2930997976137ef35","2f9f77ee4fa453cd114665f8b487570c0affe235","6b5400accd647fbc87fd73a87ffddb5f5459337c","56c0a1ce7cca73a7c9be0c242847e66fd74801b3","27bb9a5ddbba4e1d6126c7675de6565fce527032","68e86487d52827bea1def54a20c377a122de531b","c17014959370282e7c3efc96d9d831c1663c919f","d503665b98dc5c5630b39ac53ebee5a9cfa1f084","a71f6d2d49eda16193bf5578662c11d3ed986355","d79f92b4880b6c4e49a02fb84ea1e542a8556822","d63585ecf59daec5858990ef610a69963c4c0787","fec661af02fe4d51c478ac8a5097eb3cb67e0523","79675e526f2b8f67c711e833cb5675b422ebfb4e","189ef562597987ef484b43ff2c9d3fca6b797309","86e6ecc69447820effc71be1d0b012a759931426","96b5f6dc10022ccad5e61a51b20cd0aea7862617","0b15fb38056726feed31b520a06d120b19746733","b503111efb0560aaea70e950a6928116df2862a7","2ba3cc8a869cd2492e36fa48e11af7775af59956","229c3cb87d18538315b18c5ad6796ac367adf45a","2fbeba55935a0fa9597d1ef4cc1cbdac7e41e39e","421241a61dc5332237c84116422043c3503f6577","51d7efedb9a00b411616622e575cdb65f57b9413","eb1cbb14f09e895b1d2c36d75811dec863190376","404d38143b1078fcb4329f6addbd781d2a99f9b0","c2070e3e1fce3c420d4e3c2d310fb63f5aa7ccb6","95eb1efa27358aa89dda77545758bc58b53ede4d","d3a7853dabbd406bb803fbec7de7292e5e65947b","29b3fdcdda43e08534d6cae560b08dd2fbe88427","780a55bf4daf8af8e0211d429f245ecf6393e92f"],"id":"97414ebe8af7409630e1223df8b2a651d476b899","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/97414ebe8af7409630e1223df8b2a651d476b899","authors":[{"name":"Aaron Archer","ids":["1729908"]},{"name":"Silvio Lattanzi","ids":["1895843"]},{"name":"Peter Likarish","ids":["2158840"]},{"name":"Sergei Vassilvitskii","ids":["1749789"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052683"}

Here, we propose the first seasonal influenza forecast framework based on a stochastic, spatially structured mechanistic model (individual level microsimulation) initialized with geo-localized microblogging data. The framework provides for more than 600 census areas in the United States, Italy and Spain, the initial conditions for a stochastic epidemic computational model that generates an ensemble of forecasts for the main indicators of the epidemic season: peak time and intensity. We evaluate the forecasts accuracy and reliability by comparing the results from our framework with the data from the official influenza surveillance systems in the US, Italy and Spain in the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16. In all countries studied, the proposed framework provides reliable results with leads of up to 6 weeks that became more stable and accurate with progression of the season.

A characteristic feature of the mechanistic modeling approach is in the explicit estimate of key epidemiological parameters relevant for public health decision-making that cannot be achieved with statistical models not considering the disease dynamic. Furthermore, the presented framework allows the fusion of multiple data streams in the initialization stage and can be enriched with census, weather and socioeconomic data.","inCitations":["663c7d66e4faab855b34f4e188473fcbe0151860","c1eb02241ad818440bcdbf13dd1d5b41bbb2e067","8fe6558a93742025c1d4340d2b708170ecaea4c6","68bebe9ddd6c77189249a64a425e78941b08dc7b","d0a3a2ba90d1817d6fc2b1b9092457ca09e818e6","3bc91df4b692d986f0b0605ffffc1af11bf05efb","b8a65e6098f5c42bc9df5c54bbb41b510c82d1e5","a4065dac9941328f4f67dc84035965ff67ed6fe7","d8de6199763ec442058950d4a0ff68ce0b992854"],"pmid":"","title":"Forecasting Seasonal Influenza Fusing Digital Indicators and a Mechanistic Disease Model","journalPages":"311-319","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e6e6/9e9f4e476e77dc15e208f4c8db615d64bfb0.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p311.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052678","http://gala.gre.ac.uk/16622/7/16622%20PERRA_Forescasting_Seasonal_Influenza_2017.pdf"],"entities":["Color gradient","Computation","Computational model","Digital data","Incidence matrix","Initial condition","Proxy server","Real-time computing","Real-time transcription","Statistical model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1ce00c09488829d6a386917f17cffb3cd47e30f6","c490ccb194330ad3d6d661339f0ab1c1cde8a13d","42e8308872f46fcb048577dc194bec7719e2ae72","3b80e4f9b896ae8d33e77ab32640dc3dda0c4001","29ae1c0b24ce850d05ea6c30b749c8e242a4f56a","e83cf95afc8dbfd7f4bfe08de6c0ab8624527eca","2a9bf28f1c39ea8b0693f5998743dac9c8ffcd24","3cef40fce27a04a85ab537853330f72f75495a67","c1605dc51ce6eda9de7871fd4b066c2ae2e9184d","0826b4328ec673f6b5b452fa217d35a2bb92eca3","a13e0dbbc26923cccf7b9ec4b49e94ede1ed3b80","e51dcb71eebe45ff3b0556005914a26f759db6f6","d777dba5942bf0f80ed43d01a27e83be791a714d","687a6a77fcfe143198c311f734a0d68e00943ceb","dd731d60cd22629d95f96be1237f0bdc47af6b8a","2fa451a290b3f1a7615daa29b2e6feedf16f4990","9bb58a4465ac0b1d181898a33e2fc890db4fdb27","3b0f3c909e28caef86dc0d33a1e3161e2b7773ed","babe33b9e196e35b7b8f76ad59c0cf8aa74d2910","99e753ff6da785d328fd372c657a08922a8b3e24","c0ad1d5a9ebdd27a8c3fafd7b472c1b2ce5f9ce5","0f28cbfe0674e0af4899d21dd90f6f5d0d5c3f1b","cb5fcb01b7ce1ffb9c0d9b6e6cada57130d91479","8da3131792edd59c1654b7cbc3649cc7b0cef70c","7d9f426165cc10a1ce279136f8c3b3362f7a0bb9","a12a068054488415264eacda4786bfe0b5fec7b5","6687eedf4486e908dbdfa40ee001e12cc83fa2de","33e1d43c3a299d752c18d906c954c6e0fa21e5fe","2b5081abd1c0a606f63c58bfcf47bea6d2075ac5","5b2ee58fb08ad1b8359d2210016f7563ac677b6e","06b50b893dd4b142a4059f3250bb876d61dd205e","da84df262b795adce169cd94d7b4bdd1d51aba57","22d6ba3a04d6814c112861f67d94884177e2fa05","5698dbd8e2b46b6994626018991abb4ff296fd5c","5f47dff76174f0a0cda429e2ed0e733b4026ddea","2425541d73ab641659f31abb400f330b5e48ac36","3c7802c024ad9498832ef4537a6774f3a16ad791","d0b74491b72fbfd747ffa621d59d9e5fc6c33699","ca4b6c4d3e1797c89ad9a338923f4845b423af3a","06b8ec553c0aa6497b19e433c54ae1dd8d9a9fd8","7107f9735e701cc6ac3a3a74ab644ce9c21368b9","2b669a2499083f0488823d8ed664e50fc0c42719","325292fbd89605a78dc3a56e1d97b816731b0dff","bab035bbc719ecdb3ffcb2a14b97f1390939a744","5f245ceddfbeda0b0fa871ad551a205f9fcbc835","4c99b87df6385bd945a00633f829e4a9ec5ce314","ab5de6c13f2ded6eeb366c2f139f6bd462f50b5e","27b5d66b4e113c3262312481e0f0a62f67d30c5d","3f88b98065d5aef44b886d9356c90cc3964c348a","85b1d48a132a0e9c6df4702e99656e1a6133f2bb"],"id":"39c466dd18561692ab3c322f2af10fc1f3c5d08d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/39c466dd18561692ab3c322f2af10fc1f3c5d08d","authors":[{"name":"Qian Zhang","ids":["1737486"]},{"name":"Nicola Perra","ids":["1826736"]},{"name":"Daniela Perrotta","ids":["8306075"]},{"name":"Michele Tizzoni","ids":["2349638"]},{"name":"Daniela Paolotti","ids":["2504674"]},{"name":"Alessandro Vespignani","ids":["1690690"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052678"}

This paper presents an analysis of the reason this problem has been so well explored but persists with no solution widely available. The problem is viewed as a combination of Smart City needs, governance, and increasingly technically difficult decisions. The paper describes the requirements that must be met to develop a framework that can address this seeming intractable and expanding integration concern, identifies the governance processes that can be used to address this problem, and to manage integration in Smart Cities, The solution proposed is a formalized accepted and managed technology regulated environment introduced by governance groups composed of city planners/managers, citizen, stake holders, and technology delivery organizations. The solution requirements dictate the establishment of a standard that would guide the development and usage of automated, autonomous components, integrating dynamically with software agents. All of this working to rapidly optimize shared resources through error handling processes executing largely at no cost except those of processing time, meeting safety guidelines, satisfying operational monitoring needs, and meeting post issue liability guidelines. This technical standard would obligate developers and vendors to meet safety standards and accept liability for malfeasance. As initiating steps, Smart City managers must come together and establish a basic understanding of the goals and regulations, and the methodologies for implementing them.","inCitations":["26932960c412b2bdcf2409e856f9d86643505d48","dcc48ed8ed03fafba97cd096baabdf772ce460d9"],"pmid":"","title":"Establishing Smart City Technical Standards and Guidance: A Way Forward","journalPages":"1161-1166","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e7b2/37a950a62043208fb7a7267a78c74343c360.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1161.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054715"],"entities":["Autonomous robot","Complex systems","Exception handling","Mechatronics","Requirement","Smart city","Software agent","Technical standard"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1ff2844f9bd75e8e89d4cbaddc7e4d4a7fd7fc76","0679ddfebcfd1536d83bdd8305f6dacd99d23fc8","9958aaeb3f4e7fd7088741bd5b0402a632d39e32","05ac93ae8e426a2a039c7510fb002c39d94e677b","35184a6d03c731a20d40107107a6ff4c0969ad7f","740c59120540b15b9e8cf712c17448c1fa3466f7","e1bbfd52e3c96899e6ae9250c3a41985858fae11","31abcf70a3a118269d4b5707a7f06b0ef8cdaab9"],"id":"e7b237a950a62043208fb7a7267a78c74343c360","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e7b237a950a62043208fb7a7267a78c74343c360","authors":[{"name":"Stephen J.

Presently, the mutual kNN graph is the most preferred as it reduces hub nodes which can be a cause of failure during the process of label propagation. However, the mutual kNN graph, which is usually very sparse, suffers from over sparsification problem. That is, although the number of edges connecting nodes that have different labels decreases in the mutual kNN graph, the number of edges connecting nodes that have the same labels also reduces. In addition, over sparsification can produce a disconnected graph, which is not desirable for label propagation. So we present a new graph construction method, the centered kNN graph, which not only reduces hub nodes but also avoids the over sparsification problem.","inCitations":["5785345695e6eddcfbd167a2a039d81d76c9a8a8"],"pmid":"","title":"Centered kNN Graph for Semi-Supervised Learning","journalPages":"857-860","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080662"],"entities":["Connectivity (graph theory)","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Software propagation","Sparse matrix","Supervised learning","USB hub"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["239b7176469d82330052403049b721b620d7faa0","888f9e5df2d0e26d335360e96b6866e5c1e3248e","15b2c44b3868a1055850846161aaca59083e0529","d01157e62da23c3bddd29ca71cc2af1cb39c9f37","775d0e6091be272171ebf40d2f431f1744bdc2ec","ac2262101f469154b133dbeece52318692fec205"],"id":"c724c83ea25c3896ee96f29f1a2f6a232796d060","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c724c83ea25c3896ee96f29f1a2f6a232796d060","authors":[{"name":"Ikumi Suzuki","ids":["2516592"]},{"name":"Kazuo Hara","ids":["34175367"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080662"}

Some EDs usually form a group where they wirelessly communicate with each other. Different ED groups are interconnected by optical fiber cables. Through coordinating the use of ED groups, we can perform a collaborative edge computing in a hybrid network where a cost-efficient opticalwireless convergence is achieved by virtualization. In this paper, we use the virtual network to describe one computingapplication\u2019s requirement for the substrate resource, and we investigate how embed multiple virtual networks onto the common network infrastructure. In our approach, a graphcutting algorithm is firstly utilized to embed as many virtual networks as possible onto the specified EDs within the same group. However, a single ED group cannot handle all computing applications competing for limited wireless and computing resources. To solve this challenging problem, we transform the virtual networks\u2014impossibly embedded onto the same ED group\u2014into new ones processed by ED groups. Simulations results demonstrate the green feature of our solution: 1) the total transmitting power assigned for EDs is effectively reduced using the graph cutting algorithm provided that all of computing applications can be solved by a single ED group; 2) our method accepts more virtual networks with the improvement ratio of 77%, through the coordination of ED groups. In addition, there is a good match between the algorithm result and the optimal number of consumed wavelengths per optical fiber cable.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Green Virtual Network Embedding for Collaborative Edge Computing in Environment-Friendly Optical-Wireless Networks","journalPages":"1531-1536","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1531.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054768"],"entities":["Algorithm","Computer simulation","Cost efficiency","Edge computing","Edge device","Embedded system","Optical fiber cable","Transmitter"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1dc6470ca8d584547024e7f36e3fe915bb87d351","500c38a3dab293b327a4461c7d90b155947d4b65","6282c3783c4dd4d9c2987b7d9122b3216e6cb6d1","3149e65ebd8f3c0bbab410c8c0733a00a842cde4","bf35617e049e37ebf70800e12f8fb54720d3157d","46f5191b14227377b9564c424658af8b59fa6b49","7dec5bfa594cebd5578d4da2b1a7ce1dbc8e6f89"],"id":"0294dabbd6c72a0d661396db8dd11ab2aad35e18","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0294dabbd6c72a0d661396db8dd11ab2aad35e18","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxue Gong","ids":["2912517"]},{"name":"Lei Guo","ids":["40270988"]},{"name":"Zhaolong Ning","ids":["34506974"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054768"}

We study the problem of natural language interface to APIs (NL2APIs), with a focus on web APIs for web services. Such NL2APIs have many potential benefits, for example, facilitating the integration of web services into virtual assistants.\n We propose the first end-to-end framework to build an NL2API for a given web API. A key challenge is to collect training data, i.e., NL command-API call pairs, from which an NL2API can learn the semantic mapping from ambiguous, informal NL commands to formal API calls. We propose a novel approach to collect training data for NL2API via crowdsourcing, where crowd workers are employed to generate diversified NL commands. We optimize the crowdsourcing process to further reduce the cost. More specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical probabilistic model for the crowdsourcing process, which guides us to allocate budget to those API calls that have a high value for training NL2APIs. We apply our framework to real-world APIs, and show that it can collect high-quality training data at a low cost, and build NL2APIs with good performance from scratch. We also show that our modeling of the crowdsourcing process can improve its effectiveness, such that the training data collected via our approach leads to better performance of NL2APIs than a strong baseline.","inCitations":["0ba2b86242e0d04cdf4e88aa5a544357e459288d","206335225e093551e97b297110225b0a6701f13f","3ea850ab5761fe7cb1e3c9c2599e1e5cd2fb2112","dc030c2e55b266c029356a54bb444b7d9b1f2abc","e8475cfc1f72f0c0e4df1556566eb719b27e83cf","8761fe4a7dbdc9fb214b7e25096053507aeb9b69"],"pmid":"","title":"Building Natural Language Interfaces to Web APIs","journalPages":"177-186","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133009","http://cs.ucsb.edu/~ysu/papers/cikm17_nl2api.pdf"],"entities":["Application programming interface","Baseline (configuration management)","Crowdsourcing","Dialog system","End-to-end principle","Language model","Mathematical optimization","NL (complexity)","Natural language user interface","Semantic mapper","Service-oriented architecture","Service-oriented device architecture","Spoken dialog systems","Statistical model","Web API","Web service"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0ed8e3871e427b33dcfb98974af0c76996134004","1b3fe379e9f321c1dfe8a802d73f1a094298f630","24ff26b9cf71d9f9a8e7dedf0cfe56d105363cd3","7a4d676d8e037321db1effaae1f1f88a3f9be07e","47c27cd2c37ba331ced0b24fba43fd917d5f6d19","b0dd99ca21a8eb04f4133cb4c2d057be037a8e32","0d98bb00dfe73bc21bbe906cb3a77764c9138b47","047a000fdd280d1953d230d162374971a32cd6b8","042db0977555fcd7d5eac67b26695cd918ecb44c","112b1448c7b309711bb8a85e282645a704a57f8f","41866f1c6e5b92d1f73749c5de1394447aa72fc5","2518ece8eeb2fecc3ed0f69adaba98ff83c026e7","0e27493639268ecd35356e5e08d45e5d0dcd7fd8","41ab97376fcbd67d05bad648b40d92d96a3f1c1c","837f29be38a14d61caf2c10248ef8d5ef48b468f","6e565308c8081e807709cb4a917443b737e6cdb4","25369f56a933e3bfb1d8e1588cdc6c50df93ecae","55f5e98bd4a32fcb5e597052f15efbea78b02fb0","1d7db886d2af3734634450d134de344f5cf3e742","1d7d7362c1e4b1544fd4ce2af7c65f9f47ffeb82","097665e66a05d316ad0e649fec374db44a485bda","673a851db00c835d17788b8a6cb7b470de493fb8","0286d2f03b29fee6381d5546a6f51df2a2cde379","745c2b01a77e63ad5835db50a0420ce4be6e1d81","0567eeecaadaf19c408a8fb5e941786e36b199ef","40d25c148b7ae32fdf1f33a9a3d7627319ce4f5c","b53686ae41b6fd5ec2ec80a8275f9bd9aac2b41a","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","0041273d39fa57ffefaba21b0a4e491b0d017b79","46a08cb624b2f7be26c1cf69ebd89446f4034ed3","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","818826f356444f3daa3447755bf63f171f39ec47"],"id":"585bf9bf946b4cd4571b2fe6f73f5a7ba9a3d601","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/585bf9bf946b4cd4571b2fe6f73f5a7ba9a3d601","authors":[{"name":"Yu Su","ids":["50087337"]},{"name":"Ahmed Hassan Awadallah","ids":["1977489"]},{"name":"Madian Khabsa","ids":["2072010"]},{"name":"Patrick Pantel","ids":["1990190"]},{"name":"Michael Gamon","ids":["2417334"]},{"name":"Mark J.

Recently, several papers explored very simple and natural approaches based on Monte Carlo sampling of Markov Chains (MC), and reported encouraging results. We show, perhaps surprisingly, that this approach is outperformed by a carefully engineered version of color coding (CC) [1], a sophisticated algorithmic technique that we extend to the case of graphlet sampling and for which we prove strong statistical guarantees. Our computational experiments on graphs with millions of nodes show CC to be more accurate than MC. Furthermore, we formally show that the mixing time of the MC approach is too high in general, even when the input graph has high conductance. All this comes at a price however. While MC is very efficient in terms of space, CC's memory requirements become demanding when the size of the input graph and that of the graphlets grow. And yet, our experiments show that a careful implementation of CC can push the limits of the state of the art, both in terms of the size of the input graph and of that of the graphlets.","inCitations":["a1b9c738687b0a6c03e04f421cd739969ea5ec28","59b96dcfe7a19cb98ce00506ec474e3b2330784a","b1f7440456c21c51363b08793c4c78c86c20e320","54d8b5eed9ca1fadd0e77c641388050febf7ed6e","733f49039d1ce077a116d03633e3338125f33196","cc2101c1368c528a7def9bf9ae711d3725933ac8","282671f4eef6191115d5468472bff5465b4f0f14","b396d5614f8864a21b7c2bfd1e7abab5d2e01a39","5e327925b770897267b23fe37896db45b1379e39","0649ec40a153c6c31ec6005e927908ace747a2a0","1216bc7fb8a9ebe66f48286b61eca226c68ca2f8","feeece1276e3ff6abedd286747a2ebe5de7619c8","184234a97a5a1459f5c72be1480e17e7b350f534"],"pmid":"","title":"Counting Graphlets: Space vs Time","journalPages":"557-566","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/6886-s18/papers/BCKLP17.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018732"],"entities":["Algorithm","Conductance (graph)","Experiment","Graph (discrete mathematics)","Markov chain","Monte Carlo method","Requirement","Sampling (signal processing)","Social network analysis","Structure mining"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3746511ef9ba685f34ceec9a3e94795be5836953","0f3fd2233b51ec5cbbb46451f1f76996d7493450","2891da32932a45f8b14bb95f7e26b5ae9677f430","05dbe031b635ab9572eed4ef88d8b0311a48b48e","9a5cd07c1ece281edd93b242e8ebbf22404d2ee4","15b4d6c0661795a30165aeaeec31dc213559e57a","141004dee9e799b40bfaf50b4a72618613137250","949df342078a0cac0110ddedac59dfbd8b2ea286","fc3601286a0c40f8b254ff5fc5db58502aea232f","0d565ac2fcd83ad1753d576850aed03ebb3e35c0","246dc6e35eef61bcc61b8051b42372d058ceb2b6","23279ca0b7f63ede92762c6d31d40472f63b15e2","018a67893088fe4885fabd7c739472c220341ea3","1091923685d6b3462a6a1cd3ecdcf7d115816234","3c3034fcead0f3a56475c0217be1e3d10fbf0db9","3246e9e2056ff7330c61f5fb368db002b0fbe129","d1c0d344d2050c316e73c2c2d1915872973a44d0","288067bb816005d100efc4d88c1a452e5eabc618","f9c34a244435e05fb13180b35f8091dbd05e5916","1c5ac31fce0e186b1ab1eb3a3a13138f20e8e09e","3e615ef61863110fcfc1a4c97dff923df66d3476","e238cc17ac8a56e720b961c0de6f623792a71985","4587d4722317acd4e2a90b12f58ccc9de1ecc6ee","225f47cb143bf7bd2316844ad964a06557c5b5cd"],"id":"b117e3ab62ce5a405428bd3b9f76afd1293e0c85","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b117e3ab62ce5a405428bd3b9f76afd1293e0c85","authors":[{"name":"Marco Bressan","ids":["1828920"]},{"name":"Flavio Chierichetti","ids":["34996452"]},{"name":"Ravi Kumar","ids":["1683442"]},{"name":"Stefano Leucci","ids":["2407396"]},{"name":"Alessandro Panconesi","ids":["1773845"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018732"}

An important type of TS analysis is classification, which can, for instance, improve energy load forecasting in smart grids by detecting the types of electronic devices based on their energy consumption profiles recorded by automatic sensors. Such sensor-driven applications are very often characterized by (a) very long TS and (b) very large TS datasets needing classification. However, current methods to time series classification (TSC) cannot cope with such data volumes at acceptable accuracy; they are either scalable but offer only inferior classification quality, or they achieve state-of-the-art classification quality but cannot scale to large data volumes. In this paper, we present WEASEL (Word ExtrAction for time SEries cLassification), a novel TSC method which is both fast and accurate. Like other state-of-the-art TSC methods, WEASEL transforms time series into feature vectors, using a sliding-window approach, which are then analyzed through a machine learning classifier. The novelty of WEASEL lies in its specific method for deriving features, resulting in a much smaller yet much more discriminative feature set. On the popular UCR benchmark of 85 TS datasets, WEASEL is more accurate than the best current non-ensemble algorithms at orders-of-magnitude lower classification and training times, and it is almost as accurate as ensemble classifiers, whose computational complexity makes them inapplicable even for mid-size datasets. The outstanding robustness of WEASEL is also confirmed by experiments on two real smart grid datasets, where it out-of-the-box achieves almost the same accuracy as highly tuned, domain-specific methods.","inCitations":["2422028e6092eea7e5a900d0bfb7b78ad55c7222","b7690891e401126faeefb010a861d2401be4608b","3665bec103533566d7580441227f35a000c9b5ff","272e3ba29e49480b499994635d567c143581c5ad","9ae6344b631769e9b6f53434cd06fc0d61e18492","da8d418c0850c40667bffc47ed09e98532e9689b","a75da5376b48c0cc1c307561d14e0f177341afc0","6f66ba8b25b93dee2340e8db196f126e124f5fe5","fb4268e5d66c54005f24b93dd15a143d51deeeea"],"pmid":"","title":"Fast and Accurate Time Series Classification with WEASEL","journalPages":"637-646","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07681v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07681","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132980","https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~schaefpa/weasel.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Benchmark (computing)","Computational complexity theory","Emoticon","Ensemble learning","Experiment","Fastest","Feature selection","Feature vector","Machine learning","Out of the box (feature)","Remote Desktop Services","Scalability","Sensor","Time series"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f056431d4411677491290c1a12e3ed7e441ce4da","38b8469376f2d504191f03ec1d36e2d69933250c","244e27bf8c5a5277a733c5271fdeb306f98115d5","ae254ff2a3523f5e38fd810aac58c63d13569513","75cd6fbce9a6bdc38e502e1effae80eed16035c9","037b3d3ddfded992dd068730f4b5d7e7793a780d","2666bfb6787da71ee1ab7170668097a3b05c1c65","c50510c8ccf2a24e98db1ca3b1d34e41a759d286","22d3574f5923086edf72c5840b048959fc2b46ad","27cfb0a893063bf6c84246f90cdec1d8350d0720","d6a31b9769e67e68b2f5fd3cf2d910e8353929f1","a3e196bca65680e27062e201e63fd2cabd51aca5","afe277b66a11992443b6be83cceba17ddf688689","b436b033856bc873ea8378666e764174722824f3","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","7c1c7899fdf5f0ef87cd80b0df3b7e43c44ca4e1","32f400bb002bc72d53f1fd6ce41b957019626dc7","2ace11d00f638bc6c7cba39c0ba63401e0e53eb0","b2dbc7898c3284da363b41a270b82abf0b16ee80","6b17827b6e2563f10b53b8b37c95f5af5415c556","5ac5fbae8a7faf2e9bd49ad01106cec4a2d8f20a","56b4c3f416af26fc3a97df8ea12ef726f9894063","259c54fb0244e44f97d4218871f62deb64fa66f3","89c936454534cb83bfa3d706008542ac49c807de","5d712877c649aa92cb030eba85c11c099270806a","01c15f043b61728054f4da5a97d907417fc2f44b","6aad7940023151500673b45689d9e4a14349873c","2261c3f6f12df277d2d6546d9702a12fac42261d","0b62b8d22cc201ef7bf08012893d1fcdc6426c11","58d97fc5834835d70c659d3f29611b7053ae5d95","27db63ab642d9c27601a9311d65b63e2d2d26744","5ed965000e6692f9c8a214c0d76e59e674e4e8ae","9c13e54760455a50482cda070c70448ecf30d68c","09e6e69aa09ad20ef196140049b7a5e0dfc9b86f","23f8df14bb665e74134bdbe29441069eaaefbb0e","b829d53befb725877381a81edfc7c9ae33b385bd"],"id":"f0fbd013eebe694c820cc98b451b658cf67cacf9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f0fbd013eebe694c820cc98b451b658cf67cacf9","authors":[{"name":"Patrick Schäfer","ids":["1781284"]},{"name":"Ulf Leser","ids":["1693022"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132980"}

The analysis surprisingly reveals that both blogs and Twitter datasets agree that the dominant source of smoking cessation is related to weight loss (shape body appearance), or body-look, while the support group, which includes any clinician supports, plays little impact on the smokers\u2019 quit motivation, a result that maybe precious for health authorities.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Smoking Cessation Causes: Contrasting Evidence from Social Media and Online Forums","journalPages":"34-40","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0342/d7fcb6798fb48e3efe0fd65afecfc2f7f7a4.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1840/paper_5.pdf"],"entities":["Blog","SQLite","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["df91d120affcfb68de7eea286dc9f85d78882360","e01210bc1771a263f7673e49d6c4b61640ceb44e","74feeb26daa4d1fe4b7ac85b17efda55d277b41b","b7cb37b86e84c4e7bb9ea104a5b24e5f3267109d","b16314a67e3894c16b72fe9067a73cf275647cba","c71e9a235bdd63af02f4fcd46c5fc78400ca8828","bf9a45f5204a5421f3b47fd7d1e74501b282914a","75af87fa3e7d87b922643ac8209f490d9a82ccba"],"id":"0342d7fcb6798fb48e3efe0fd65afecfc2f7f7a4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0342d7fcb6798fb48e3efe0fd65afecfc2f7f7a4","authors":[{"name":"Foaad Farooghian","ids":["16784671"]},{"name":"Mourad Oussalah","ids":["39385994"]}],"doi":""}

However, finding ground truths especially for developing and rural areas is quite hard and manually labeling a large set of training data is costly. In this work, we propose an ongoing research named DeepVGI which aims at deeply learning from satellite imageries with the supervision of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). VGI data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and a crowdsourcing mobile application named MapSwipe which allows volunteers to label images with buildings or roads for humanitarian aids are utilized. Meanwhile, an active learning framework with deep neural networks is developed by incorporating both VGI data with more complete supervision knowledge. Our experiments show that DeepVGI can achieve high building detection performance for humanitarian mapping in rural African areas.","inCitations":["b1c5708fb3dbdb3aa1d91c0cc4aa32660196b0e0","49d4cb2e1788552a04c7f8fec33fbfabb3882995","db8d6040a0013fe05e316dc41b72717bfdfd88e2","c94e2413316aedc260ece9ba6f0f2ebe82407555","0726a5febc6b3d9b9fe128a437e6da1589b19388"],"pmid":"","title":"DeepVGI: Deep Learning with Volunteered Geographic Information","journalPages":"771-772","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9c6c/1c132512960988743f5e62b1b93898311e3d.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p771.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054250"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Crowdsourcing","Deep learning","Experiment","Mobile app","OpenStreetMap","Volunteered geographic information"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4bf034ec0f546ab28c0961fbe7a2ed7705af6579","cdfdaccd946dc2fe4863aed048b12b5d2282f285"],"id":"9c6c1c132512960988743f5e62b1b93898311e3d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9c6c1c132512960988743f5e62b1b93898311e3d","authors":[{"name":"Jiaoyan Chen","ids":["1731892"]},{"name":"Alexander Zipf","ids":["2924672"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054250"}

Unfortunately, this process is not straightforward. First, patient-specific variations are typically large and population-based models derived or learned from many different patients are often unable to support accurate predictions for each individual patient. Moreover, time series observed for one patient at any point in time may be too short and insufficient to learn a high-quality patient-specific model just from the patient's own data. To address these problems we propose, develop and experiment with a new adaptive forecasting framework for building multivariate clinical time series models for a patient and for supporting patient-specific predictions. The framework relies on the adaptive model switching approach that at any point in time selects the most promising time series model out of the pool of many possible models, and consequently, combines advantages of the population, patient-specific and short-term individualized predictive models. We demonstrate that the adaptive model switching framework is very promising approach to support personalized time series prediction, and that it is able to outperform predictions based on pure population and patient-specific models, as well as, other patient-specific model adaptation strategies.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"29296289v1","title":"A Personalized Predictive Framework for Multivariate Clinical Time Series via Adaptive Model Selection","journalPages":"\n          1169-1177\n        ","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.zitaoliu.com/download/cikm2017_slides.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47217340","http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/research/2017/Liu_Hauskrecht_cikm2017_PubMed.pdf","http://www.zitaoliu.com/download/cikm2017.pdf"],"entities":["Acclimatization","Genetic Selection","Heart rate variability","MALL gene","Model selection","PRAME gene","Patients","Personalization","Population","Predictive modelling","Projections and Predictions","Spatial variability","Time series"],"journalVolume":"2017","outCitations":["0624b46f9d1addbff15cadc3529480642e4e9216","03ec9a68104e97e6962e586c5be023467c59d1f7","20faa2ef4bb4e84b1d68750cda28d0a45fb16075","121d9c737a887f7f6a03ffbc5be87b26bdad17f8","8dacee828c4adcc8d72dea37d1bfd3c19a31b9ea","52a070802cc1af0f44d82d6c3b6e95509b83c522","10d10df314c1b58f5c83629e73a35185876cd4e2","47598c6267a065ad0f9226c0a130728fedf18b81","c57d983ebc509104057fb3f5c447fc1fd95cd590","f9707f0dd6ff04899d7a3323668ee9ed1b9ad28e","38620d4cad3db4bdb19675f44ab85488ab952e46","aa74e96737fbab4745e813265eaab5b0990eb968","4fe152d692a4a0c4a7e604e840d83d134d084d51","84e92c573b4cf5bd7e9dde5a436ec8fdeac244b4","757dc51464407c1c999e9de05c4c4b40f8447ba1","568afeb1de772be7d9f661a0a51c00052f4c70fd","00af4fba4bc85262d381881848c3ad67536fcb6b","28c2f17bc9e4300d4eecf4901d3475e00d4a8012","9c55282dc2f59a8b28142ff2c9abaca021c52758","49c00fca17df83e1cdeb56c348328995636059cc","25ba7db2735bae4b0f77f5cc48c6a982085d72b5","e306e0b1702faed407753697a4be36355b881e93","38e96fe3c3fe2d8b106e2ccd0faa476546003029","033caef62392ec0f91849cf0746a5fe6cc801799","1c7ba2bec9209cb49b647becccbe4d2e7334438d","ac498bc49bc9ec706f0e48819138f4927b5d9395","cffb82776ccd5281c2693d9994fffe9fd8068cc6","45b764d927b39261d4ea008bc183b4a6c0265688","9534a6ed62dad35285895face782b493130a7789"],"id":"2d2fe1c724e550d3e0e1c23c3ca7c6be545d0ca5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2d2fe1c724e550d3e0e1c23c3ca7c6be545d0ca5","authors":[{"name":"Zitao Liu","ids":["3195628"]},{"name":"Milos Hauskrecht","ids":["1731761"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132859"}

SmartMTD models and quantifies two types of source relations to estimate source reliability precisely and to detect malicious agreement among sources for multi-truth discovery. Two graphs are constructed based on the modeled source relations, which are further used to derive two aspects of source reliability via random walk computation.","inCitations":["a167bfd52d17baca47f6431cb6621cb93ae93e21","29a1406a840e43bb5e8a47191be0b6cdc26b7a31"],"pmid":"","title":"Value Veracity Estimation for Multi-Truth Objects via a Graph-Based Approach","journalPages":"777-778","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a240/e76d7552960f0a48c37f11c8f948327aa20a.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p777.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054212"],"entities":["Computation","Veracity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["579e1e9217cfed6d563cedf8f8fdcd1604fc0917","61dc7b3bcdff4e0fec03880ee079ae06f8fe32f9","f94350a59508ce0175e33b3427ff0dd92ccc9abf"],"id":"a240e76d7552960f0a48c37f11c8f948327aa20a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a240e76d7552960f0a48c37f11c8f948327aa20a","authors":[{"name":"Xiu Susie Fang","ids":["35060091"]},{"name":"Quan Z.

The public cloud offers three main benefits to firms: 1) utilization can be scaled up or down easily; 2) capital expenditure (on-premises servers) can be converted to operating expenses, with the capital incurred by a specialist; 3) software can be \u201cpay-as-you-go.\u201d These benefits increase with the firm\u2019s ability to dynamically scale resource utilization and thus point to the need for dynamic prices to shape demand to the (short-run) fixed datacenter supply. Detailed utilization analysis reveals the large swings in utilization at the hourly, daily or weekly level are very rare at the customer level and non-existent at the datacenter level. Furthermore, few customers show volatility patterns that are excessively correlated with the market. These results explain why fixed prices currently prevail despite the seeming need for timevarying dynamics. Examining the actual CPU utilization provides a lens into the future. Here utilization varies by order half the datacenter capacity, but most firms are not dynamically scaling their assigned resources at-present to take advantage of these changes. If these gains are realized, demand fluctuations would be on par with the three classic industries where dynamic pricing is important (hotels, electricity, airlines) and dynamic prices would be essential for efficiency.","inCitations":["04661bfc04701afad01a9b78ea6d88a9883ad31d","ef0779a53a485ad2097e24572fa006258b92a135","628b71711457f1a615f57ec179e278a8d01f837a","dc36c0334e1bcbc204381036fcbcda08027900bb","383a87da83ac202b5ea6ca4e043ca7049300153d","aef4f9a704832d654d776b79797b1219e8473377"],"pmid":"","title":"Usage Patterns and the Economics of the Public Cloud","journalPages":"83-91","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8a86/f143b8bb22b6fea93c8c70c35cfb5b490a17.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p83.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052707"],"entities":["Central processing unit","Cloud computing","Data center","Image scaling","On-premises software","Volatility"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d3c4876dfaf703bfcbc77184ba0cefe8caff10df","664098394c5cf28fed5fee1a09af57cec50bc895","610f5e505a94544edf774d28f89558670bcc2318","c078af02c5faf117e87c8509129706879ec9d449","47b0d6c0c40d6ec07cc63794df13bfcae47668d6","61093ca3afcc72f04bebbbad7b9fd98d09438122","dba46ff18ed8e96497ebe197611536a8128e7386","3d3a43d163ca201dceeccadc14991dad350b03a7","067c7857753e21e7317b556c86e30be60aa7cac0","5047f4eb460037988de612857814fe476bdf5c72","52da80c95cbdd05fdd8dd7246997c0aea2c24aff"],"id":"8a86f143b8bb22b6fea93c8c70c35cfb5b490a17","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8a86f143b8bb22b6fea93c8c70c35cfb5b490a17","authors":[{"name":"Cinar Kilcioglu","ids":["2645113"]},{"name":"Justin M.

We can predict the convergence of the two directions in the future.","inCitations":["cb9f1c9f80df0434df82a956a3c0817ff3416780","1ca12cb033866f065b77655f635d5b7c3a9db365","32462ddeb54392b42d497255edf4af9c4c19d624"],"pmid":"","title":"Digital City, Smart City and Beyond","journalPages":"1151-1152","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7a4/fc7958f2f2fa7f05933b59fe793ec18a5f35.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054710","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1151.pdf"],"entities":["Cyberspace","Networked Society","Smart city","Socialization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5bc255158609f61aa603e0445742b800cbc72d18","28307c06e1bfb0a393a66c6f6cd08bb3d839fdde","13e24a51fe8a706e731f2f83c581786032399044","e872c2f1c38a408061170d6536062cea5cd14579","342fd9e7e9c54851f5976c8dbc9e05627b3d3968","bccf79aca81fa54a7419bf57ad3bfcc82f6ef526","3575373a7b27eeccac7580b93d775fcda58aa17b","cbecec2c904a7743bc8ed78dc0adeb492d397712"],"id":"d7a4fc7958f2f2fa7f05933b59fe793ec18a5f35","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d7a4fc7958f2f2fa7f05933b59fe793ec18a5f35","authors":[{"name":"Toru Ishida","ids":["1709883"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054710"}

Understanding the quality of Wikidata is key to its widespread adoption as a knowledge resource. We analyse one aspect of Wikidata quality, provenance, in terms of relevance and authoritativeness of its external references. We follow a two-staged approach. First, we perform a crowdsourced evaluation of references. Second, we use the judgements collected in the first stage to train a machine learning model to predict reference quality on a large-scale. The features chosen for the models were related to reference editing and the semantics of the triples they referred to. 61% of the references evaluated were relevant and authoritative. Bad references were often links that changed and either stopped working or pointed to other pages. The machine learning models outperformed the baseline and were able to accurately predict non-relevant and nonauthoritative references. Further work should focus on implementing our approach in Wikidata to help editors find bad references.","inCitations":["29b6ae174ed9c0447a0ca05b6186a46b8ff8f863"],"pmid":"","title":"Provenance Information in a Collaborative Knowledge Graph: An Evaluation of Wikidata External References","journalPages":"542-558","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0b48/ae4f5a0a28a7273278edf5607f1ce1000cd1.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://videolectures.net/site/normal_dl/tag=1145396/iswc2017_piscopo_external_references_01.pdf","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/412923/1/WD_sources_iswc_7_.pdf","https://iswc2017.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/MainProceedings/71.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_32"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Crowdsourcing","Knowledge Graph","Machine learning","Relevance","The Machine","Wikidata"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"834b9ebf1fb47481434f91febee13f29716d8b04","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/834b9ebf1fb47481434f91febee13f29716d8b04","authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Piscopo","ids":["5677562"]},{"name":"Lucie-Aimée Kaffee","ids":["23319388"]},{"name":"Chris Phethean","ids":["2296797"]},{"name":"Elena Paslaru Bontas Simperl","ids":["2927032"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_32"}

While many of these applications require a reasonably quick response and may operate on data that is constantly changing, existing methods often lack speed and adaptability to cope with these requirements. This is aggravated by the fact that knowledge graphs are often extremely large and may easily contain millions of entities rendering many of these methods impractical. In this paper, we address the weaknesses of current methods by proposing Random Semantic Tensor Ensemble (RSTE), a scalable ensemble-enabled framework based on tensor factorization. Our proposed approach samples a knowledge graph tensor in its graph representation and performs link prediction via ensembles of tensor factorization. Our experiments on both publicly available datasets and real world enterprise/sales knowledge bases have shown that our approach is not only highly scalable, parallelizable and memory efficient, but also able to increase the prediction accuracy significantly across all datasets.","inCitations":["03489091c66fb77fd619af48af5ed5a521e2fdb5","729fbc6664890c4e78cbcb2686a9b5e895255485"],"pmid":"","title":"Random Semantic Tensor Ensemble for Scalable Knowledge Graph Link Prediction","journalPages":"751-760","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018695"],"entities":["Decision support system","Entity Bean","Experiment","Graph (abstract data type)","Knowledge Graph","Knowledge base","Question answering","Recommender system","Requirement","Scalability","Semantic search","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["04cc04457e09e17897f9256c86b45b92d70a401f","16840a46b3980eb39382814adfe2270bd5bbdbc7","68a33a3afac65eb6e0fb3726c1f9c8b727f32a42","498ca0a1f8c980586408addf7ab2919ecdb7dd3d","01b369ccb8932b932a13b618dfa99f890c3ddcfd","50d53cc562225549457cbc782546bfbe1ac6f0cf","5fcd0bddeae261726d3c5552966857e89c59b97a","2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05","13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986","3dd5b127b18fd1e7e36b2d8b4c97b06f9bf38999","07ed71b436b9adf23f0f93c8e4533461b82e769a","e925b965e5eac3b6a414bad051990f2f57875845","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","c5b28cae82b14417f1250e58bb241367248e827d","a77cf5d0d0b8fa64890e66152c5f7f6fe75c9b7c","bb75de5280ff9b0bbdd74633b9887d10fbe0ae10","8eae36cabdce7cba7c1fc316596002cd84ed5e95","994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726"],"id":"df4e257b5d763193d81e466a351728ff6d335fd3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/df4e257b5d763193d81e466a351728ff6d335fd3","authors":[{"name":"Yi Tay","ids":["3665875"]},{"name":"Anh Tuan Luu","ids":["1755919"]},{"name":"Siu Cheung Hui","ids":["1716044"]},{"name":"Falk Brauer","ids":["2723200"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018695"}

Predicting the future dynamics of an event at a very early stage is significantly valuable, e.g, helping company anticipate marketing trends before the event becomes mature. However, this prediction is non-trivial because a) social events always stay with \"noise'' under the same topic and b) the information obtained at its early stage is too sparse and limited to support an accurate prediction. In order to overcome these two problems, in this paper, we design an event early embedding model (EEEM) that can 1) extract social events from noise, 2) find the previous similar events, and 3) predict future dynamics of a new event. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale dataset of Twitter data demonstrate the capacity of our model on extract events and the promising performance of prediction by considering both volume information as well as content information.","inCitations":["c538d717dab54b2e9bc8e4bdbf6138a26a24460d","de2c63754f420df0f1a43fa57f7cb6168561080f"],"pmid":"","title":"Event Early Embedding: Predicting Event Volume Dynamics at Early Stage","journalPages":"997-1000","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080700"],"entities":["Emoticon","Experiment","Regular expression","Social media","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["16a651ad4a558d428c18fa92094433de89dbd7fc","04994c7784b915764668b546d60643114f5fc580","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","119a67a62b0e9351e4348d234d9eae4c84f366a3","2abac12c9a4a088475dc6f63bb249ecb539624ec","a47b9bac81a5a4cbee82309edb3333bc7cf2f4e7","e7a7d04463c04b4bc1f472b3d36ff164e9fd92c8","093acf67883f50d5c9c8b1d9b3ef58029218287c","14eb2c5cf9641e431c6715c8abf5e594c2bcc792","0046e28e9e9f973ebeda2c399f5169d2c177db79","0f74ff9c9cd94ee2c874b9e3a979665c1cb4c0ac","a9f45938eb74c293fc78b824993d73a0c3daca69"],"id":"93ca05adf3f644f300621f920c363447bbe56887","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/93ca05adf3f644f300621f920c363447bbe56887","authors":[{"name":"Zhiwei Liu","ids":["40448513"]},{"name":"Yang Yang","ids":["6897666"]},{"name":"Zi Xuan Huang","ids":["2484050"]},{"name":"Fumin Shen","ids":["2731972"]},{"name":"Dongxiang Zhang","ids":["2712862"]},{"name":"Heng Tao Shen","ids":["1724393"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080700"}

In order to understand the prevalence and scope of this threat, we obtain access to over a hundred-thousand business listings on Google Maps that were suspended for abuse. We categorize the types of abuse affecting Google Maps; analyze how miscreants circumvented the protections against fraudulent business registration such as postcard mail verification; identify the volume of search queries affected; and ultimately explore how miscreants generated a profit from traffic that necessitates physical proximity to the victim.

The needs of a large global corporate lead us to model a frequently asked question (FAQ) to be an equivalence class of actually asked questions, for which there is a common answer (certified as being consistent with the organization's policy). When a new question is posed to our system, it finds the class of question, and responds with the answer for the class. At this point, the system is either correct (gives correct answer); or incorrect (gives wrong answer); or incomplete (says \"I don't know''). We employ a hybrid deep-learning architecture in which a BiLSTM-based classifier is combined with second BiLSTM-based Siamese network in an iterative manner: Questions for which the classifier makes an error during training are used to generate a set of misclassified question-question pairs. These, along with correct pairs, are used to train the Siamese network to drive apart the (hidden) representations of the misclassified pairs. We present experimental results from our deployment showing that our iteratively trained hybrid network: (a) results in better performance than using just a classifier network, or just a Siamese network; (b) performs better than state-of-the art sentence classifiers in the two areas in which it has been deployed, in terms of both accuracy as well as precision-recall tradeoff; and (c) also performs well on a benchmark public dataset. We also observe that using question-question pairs in our hybrid network, results in marginally better performance than using question-to-answer pairs. Finally, estimates of precision and recall from the deployment of our automated assistant suggest that we can expect the burden on our HR department to drop from answering about 6000 queries a day to about 1000.","inCitations":["74d3eae6802abe20c4cd1baa61ad1602bc01d3c4","68ea32b55b233cb34f9199679ef3fef676f79be2","189a3c9843aff5e9f17764babb85e65e66efc485"],"pmid":"","title":"Hybrid BiLSTM-Siamese network for FAQ Assistance","journalPages":"537-545","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132861"],"entities":["Algorithm","Applications of artificial intelligence","Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Benchmark (computing)","Categorization","Deep learning","Emoticon","Iterative method","Loss function","Natural language","Precision and recall","Real life","Softmax function","Software deployment","Turing completeness"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["71d3ed17c0642234a921bb45fcadd86520794941","cf2137aa921067af5711583288ed71b6cf7a0cdd","2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","711fdbbda67ad19c2f5ca8a5fc34395a38c68f54","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","10f62af29c3fc5e2572baddca559ffbfd6be8787","3208b5abafa1146e7df1073090523c822909275e","1827de6fa9c9c1b3d647a9d707042e89cf94abf0","25534dbae461e383f4900d268e81306eac3398dc","2e10643c3759f97b673ff8c297778c0b6c20032b","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","62a97ac04e742ad1513cf164760e4d6a25d93203","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","6d5e12ee5d75d5f8c04a196dd94173f96dc8603f","df6f365d504907a537609b49bfc4f4392b68c40d","eba36ac75bf22edf9a1bfd33244d459c75b98305","84f134f0472b43f998cba05162ff6b41c12659c3","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","ced76a7bf4c90b7dce83a44e99eb2d3947da48a8","8e54dd2b426b8d656a77c155818a87dd34c40754","6812fb9ef1c2dad497684a9020d8292041a639ff","3228bb307685af9aba1bc5b3e71ea81255467a82","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","58c45859350b7e9fc2dc6676e318e8f526073f5f","24b4746688c15c8580d1000d4f4ac63f5eb79561"],"id":"878b1379e32ff6f3397a4013921ba11fa31d9039","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/878b1379e32ff6f3397a4013921ba11fa31d9039","authors":[{"name":"Prerna Khurana","ids":["2919584"]},{"name":"Puneet Agarwal","ids":["4431988"]},{"name":"Gautam Shroff","ids":["2393804"]},{"name":"Lovekesh Vig","ids":["3213990"]},{"name":"Ashwin Srinivasan","ids":["34340386"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132861"}

Such characteristics favor sequence modeling tasks. However, it still remains a huge challenge to model sequences with DGMs. Unlike real-valued data that can be directly fed into models, sequence data consist of discrete elements and require being transformed into certain representations first. This leads to the following two challenges. First, high-level features are sensitive to small variations of inputs as well as the way of representing data. Second, the models are more likely to lose long-term information during multiple transformations. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Generative Model With Dual Memory to address the two challenges. Furthermore, we provide a method to efficiently perform inference and learning on the model. The proposed model extends basic DGMs with an improved hierarchically organized multi-layer architecture. Besides, our model incorporates memories along dual directions, respectively denoted as broad memory and deep memory. The model is trained end-to-end by optimizing a variational lower bound on data log-likelihood using the improved stochastic variational method. We perform experiments on several tasks with various datasets and obtain excellent results. The results of language modeling show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art results in terms of generative performance. Extended experiments including document modeling and sentiment analysis, prove the high-effectiveness of dual memory mechanism and latent representations. Text random generation provides a straightforward perception for advantages of our model.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Sequence Modeling with Hierarchical Deep Generative Models with Dual Memory","journalPages":"1369-1378","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132952"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Bayesian network","Benchmark (computing)","Calculus of variations","Data logger","End-to-end principle","Experiment","Generative model","High- and low-level","Lagrange multiplier","Language model","Layer (electronics)","Normalization property (abstract rewriting)","Procedural generation","Scalability","Sentiment analysis","Time complexity","Variational method (quantum mechanics)","Variational principle","Well-formed formula"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["17f5c7411eeeeedf25b0db99a9130aa353aee4ba","866d0caefa1132de04ec02c740430c5888be8093","58513e5043c8a8fb61dbe83ab58225e7f60575af","1e6945968a810d9c4a8726bab1f29ef15e924e56","100c730003033151c0f78ed1aab23df3e9bd5283","44b43b52ae5ee54d0b441579c9b57ddd09af8025","018300f5f0e679cee5241d9c69c8d88e00e8bf31","42ab3412e8a85c32929c2dbdc970c35df89bf5b3","10ebd5c40277ecba4ed45d3dc12f9f1226720523","9a296c206ef66031684152cbd3764a0f642cb688","0808bb50993547a533ea5254e0454024d98c5e2f","2abe6b9ea1b13653b7384e9c8ef14b0d87e20cfc","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","39f7830cfb2436ff215892fafb6899c7d937042a","c61d139a2382760f560164e25e4be264de5dd59f","02aca8223525caa99efc4b0e2810e450ee6776ba","052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769","30801beeb4436ce1f15e641b74a3daae836b0a0d","bff8252c3d7a2557e8a4bbbc94079d23c7c8d9fd","0bfc175fd64558505d708dfdc2aeb70b468b4823","04e0fefb859f4b02b017818915a2645427bfbdb2","9703efad5e36e1ef3ab2292144c1a796515e5f6a","1c61f9ef06fe74505775a833ff849185757199e7","7d8dd723b8cce81e8b345fba4e04a896ec76a22d","0f899b92b7fb03b609fee887e4b6f3b633eaf30d","468b9055950c428b17f0bf2ff63fe48a6cb6c998","364c1a3df58d87cb40ab33fdf3831cf2862f3570","f264e8b33c0d49a692a6ce2c4bcb28588aeb7d97","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","0c32edc991f7d2bde8a5c208e79f09c0c3a0ed65","436c3119d16ce2e3c243ffe7a4a1a5dc40b128aa","3d1427961edccf8940a360d203e44539db58a60f","245414e768c3b8c8288ac0651604a36b1a44a446","a560e5b66765e70325b11d29a0b01a2401344c5f","652d159bf64a70194127722d19841daa99a69b64","b63a6c455a24b347f6e5513b454592cc16565d6e"],"id":"454a1624891563d461b0a84250e053082b8d4a5c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/454a1624891563d461b0a84250e053082b8d4a5c","authors":[{"name":"Yanan Zheng","ids":["5446468"]},{"name":"Lijie Wen","ids":["40650846"]},{"name":"Jianmin Wang","ids":["1751179"]},{"name":"Jun Yan","ids":["8247516"]},{"name":"Lei Ji","ids":["1766637"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132952"}

International Conference on Web Search & Data Mining","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"year":2017,"paperAbstract":"Many of today's most widely used computing applications utilize social networking features and allow users to connect, follow each other, share content, and comment on others' posts. However, despite the widespread adoption of these features, there is little understanding of the consequences that social networking has on user retention, engagement, and online as well as offline behavior.\n Here, we study how social networks influence user behavior in a physical activity tracking application. We analyze 791 million online and offline actions of 6 million users over the course of 5 years, and show that social networking leads to a significant increase in users' online as well as offline activities. Specifically, we establish a causal effect of how social networks influence user behavior. We show that the creation of new social connections increases user online in-application activity by 30%, user retention by 17%, and user offline real-world physical activity by 7% (about 400 steps per day). By exploiting a natural experiment we distinguish the effect of social influence of new social connections from the simultaneous increase in user's motivation to use the app and take more steps. We show that social influence accounts for 55% of the observed changes in user behavior, while the remaining 45% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to use the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in the social network lead to significant increases in daily steps. These effects diminish with each additional edge and vary based on edge attributes and user demographics. Finally, we utilize these insights to develop a model that accurately predicts which users will be most influenced by the creation of new social network connections.","inCitations":["226146b6e35cbd16a653ed00cab4b0fa8c70e564","89b73458dcff07099db29f9435c82ca469a25b53","303a4622b9ad74f3a9a2b9dd4a63119153c56f5f","418331c61a5186314580d2d871f9859c61c2042e","7785559fccddd0f54d47f3131cf16417fb7f658c","aac1b8e1b9ee3f7f5f447520c64a649cba6cbb7a","069313181e7cd7c76cc6f0254fb03b7d119bfff2","087846516fdf387d6ec07a59f477e43d9f853e56","52b3b351dcaf8d41cbe7682ae0574a35429f5adf","490fd3e8259e93d15c289e3f806c2bc93456df15","464fc754881f6ca2cdfd679a52f472566198cb30","bdf8283eb3ee9f58e56b92300717ce4084128d1f","4bdd6090c2a6786a7e299842443ae31ff47a857d","327aff96f48dbfb95b728e84b108c04e95067f65","d0b8a5207ab63148af861c7f2c9b59be72e299e0","4c361f5b425f1092b7778f948b0ca2779c331830","13db7eed1e89caceaa7788d6cf16fc758cc7b55f","b274d91d49231849b6bde4f1af536b3282711de9","35adc17fec5f0bc5fdab254b952a504a6246d5e4","465348392a3bee4acfac41709dfd10877633960b","09f021684924ff7cce5c08329c4d9df2240ff60d","4dcbfe41682fce6aa275f20d93cc268fa8d4e49c","262a5a784eedb127490f44736844a33123b30fe0","c07b2b4f9352164bbdc268b9c4cdc64257f5f721","63587eb4a26220c7909fafb73836556f90edced1","c06e980a91c8b1b900bbd1f7b9c9ac443720cd6b"],"pmid":"28345078v1","title":"Online Actions with Offline Impact: How Online Social Networks Influence Online and Offline User Behavior","journalPages":"\n          537-546\n        ","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018672","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03053v2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03053v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03053","http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/social-influence-wsdm17.pdf"],"entities":["Causal filter","Demography","Exercise","Online and offline","REM Sleep Behavior Disorder","Social network"],"journalVolume":"2017","outCitations":["24d3f6c7d46a351919a845b2bf62da1b10c05e19","087846516fdf387d6ec07a59f477e43d9f853e56","1a48cfe2da6f5f0b79b332525e9df699c07a2ec4","1e54e8c5ed809b2b50da37a4c9b93a4aa87f5805","1068facb3bb9db48c6ff841647d5030c43e4e0c7","315a061bf865e25e27c245f1b1db2ce75b740d57","09031aa6d6743bebebc695955cd77c032cd9192f","2691890e9181740ebaef8cdc3e4badde7469227c","0e1ebbf27b303b8ccf62176e6e9370261963e2c0","471e9d18671d713528bf2255eba68476d5acdf2f","b10b6f4349bb1d70654aeb2d26d6f1128aed437c","d2744804056664257e4097ce60f5560e62797b39","3b090460441b8eb0700675ec7672035ef51bc23f","1002b31ed19a0e7373908fb620859a00bcdb1c90","f3c8b3acb61b2e13ed1140469195758b48d97592","7945aa5d69fd0a516c321f005a89a2d0b9a72fa8","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","7d6901658c53e40165c5a3a966c9eb2ab9d004fe","36d3641ca326b053625478affa405148aeda6fef","5e30bba6ff2bdf63814bf581ad1e82f6fc627af9","67739eab6289ca65f05a0747433c25b892962cb9","8aff130073bff584f63785f23f80583a32b6733d","a71f6d2d49eda16193bf5578662c11d3ed986355","46132b59a8031452455260acb8348779b0cf1375","0a6057b716fd225f9fb8e902d7c12f50b7ec4aed","1ea41b79140d9e6a5956d1302feb4a8c76c29a3d","1558a06fb4f0473f76792e830b0b07c79f7decc0","fca783b1228407c4ec9ae0b7d9c65d5d3f1e67d0","939e62c549525607e2906c571650f6496067d2bf","4587d4722317acd4e2a90b12f58ccc9de1ecc6ee","00f1ee4a4264480edc8355a26b8dfbbdfc2b33aa","1a7a1bdbebb97c839554419211fd942618a8bc06","3a33073e111f690c0fc6e1fad90b6018fa84e793","6053788472fc36ecce57e2a72e3d84987765fa81","83eec57453afd8774aaf9b9007a961a9d378bb02","216e92be827a9774130263754f2036aab0808484","72b992cd5b0461d3922d61aba4e13fd71fd9bb79","05d63702a8034f2bce76a2db4ddeb94be87f0009","04c989763bdcba7534001333b4abcf0542270f84","0ff9c0c8426fe8508f8356dfd4af3bfc6fde76c8","1073c29baf6d9cfc7b7b028024b58ed070696da3","206caa3a3ec1a15ae6280707c05c750fa100300f","076ddb6d7b62ed5d4600dae6422184c1bc61e395","370b71fa394789e2d2fb424d76ccad16975cc34d","1765178cfbf8c1052daa726da87e0034738d2193"],"id":"129d75bbcfb5da706adbdd90ce87262e99e537a2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/129d75bbcfb5da706adbdd90ce87262e99e537a2","authors":[{"name":"Tim Althoff","ids":["1745524"]},{"name":"Pranav Jindal","ids":["50435146"]},{"name":"Jure Leskovec","ids":["1702139"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018672"}

Existing methods for sentence-level sentiment classification are mainly based on supervised learning. However, it is difficult to obtain sentiment labels of sentences since manual annotation is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an approach for sentence-level sentiment classification without the need of sentence labels. More specifically, we propose a unified framework to incorporate two types of weak supervision, i.e., document-level and word-level sentiment labels, to learn the sentence-level sentiment classifier. In addition, the contextual information of sentences and words extracted from unlabeled sentences is incorporated into our approach to enhance the learning of sentiment classifier. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment classification.","inCitations":["6d5fe2873be7e2b86d35ac180de5f7cd08c3bd3b"],"pmid":"","title":"Sentence-level Sentiment Classification with Weak Supervision","journalPages":"973-976","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080693"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Naive Bayes classifier","Sentiment analysis","Supervised learning","Unified Framework"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b0aca3e7877c3c20958b0fae5cbf2dd602104859","04ba531c6a51effc0af5f115bbd14f2b2f269fe6","919c73019cc6d9814679a848fa1aae353f848170","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","0d52f84a6ce865540936de1f1dd8155274717e7a","3405c26e87ce1c5bb277da7ccec971431e15c2fd","86c75de847ff50b4d6a6c7e83719f336e9daeaf0","bfa8775282a25dcb2b5127b87fa6bd67e007d81a","b59abcfd7dbed8e284c4237c405f912adb1ad4ea","13e5f0c40c85ca8e01b3756963d5352358de7c29","1fd185dc6966a3a62459a96291700dbb236bd65f","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","58e00cde75cf11589ca53e7d2e62179a80cad19a","02acc46ccd36ce4fccbdc594d3e8992874e69178"],"id":"62f890b6038f6d007cb31df37f2f176d8cf360b9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/62f890b6038f6d007cb31df37f2f176d8cf360b9","authors":[{"name":"Fangzhao Wu","ids":["2397264"]},{"name":"Jia Zhang","ids":["50561695"]},{"name":"Zhigang Yuan","ids":["34179005"]},{"name":"Sixing Wu","ids":["8175335"]},{"name":"Yongfeng Huang","ids":["1731776"]},{"name":"Jun Yan","ids":["48270296"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080693"}

Terrorist attacks in Europe and an incoming stream of refugees in the south of the continent are some of the reasons Europe is getting socially involved in the Middle-Eastern war. It might seem that the Netherlands could become a target of the organization too. But are Dutch citizens concerned about this? In this paper, we describe the reaction of the Dutch on ISIS by analyzing what they say on Twitter about the organization. With the use of text classification, topic modeling and visualization tools, we were able to retrieve Tweets about ISIS and create a network graph displaying the ten main topics about ISIS which Dutch people tweeted about, in addition to a word cloud, displaying the words which were most used in the Tweets. The visualizations are used to analyze what topics people discussed most regarding ISIS on Twitter and how they felt about these topics. Understanding the social network responses to ISIS\u2019 attacks can give us some clues to understand its impact on the society.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"ISIS in the Eyes of the Dutch","journalPages":"28-33","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d1c/164b6c3b294a786227099700d8ed13568d34.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://eprints.eemcs.utwente.nl/27890/01/Bas_Hendrikse-SoMePeAS_2017_paper_2.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1840/paper_4.pdf","http://doc.utwente.nl/104512/5/Bas_Hendrikse-SoMePeAS_2017_paper_2.pdf"],"entities":["Document classification","ISIS","Social network","Tag cloud","Topic model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["030f6132f6b6b3336ce9b0b29c5ac4c1e368b7dc"],"id":"5d1c164b6c3b294a786227099700d8ed13568d34","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5d1c164b6c3b294a786227099700d8ed13568d34","authors":[{"name":"Bas Hendrikse","ids":["16718196"]},{"name":"Mena B.

Previous work has introduced a set of constraints (axioms) that should be satisfied by any PRF model. In this paper, we propose three additional constraints based on the proximity of feedback terms to the query terms in the feedback documents. As a case study, we consider the log-logistic model, a state-of-the-art PRF model that has been proven to be a successful method in satisfying the existing PRF constraints, and show that it does not satisfy the proposed constraints. We further modify the log-logistic model based on the proposed proximity-based constraints. Experiments on four TREC collections demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed constraints. Our modification the log-logistic model leads to significant and substantial (up to 15%) improvements. Furthermore, we show that the proposed proximity-based function outperforms the well-known Gaussian kernel which does not satisfy all the proposed constraints.","inCitations":["65cdce9211fdc76fe4ef236f8f8bb6ed5459a288"],"pmid":"","title":"Term Proximity Constraints for Pseudo-Relevance Feedback","journalPages":"1085-1088","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080728","https://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1239"],"entities":["Experiment","Exponential time hypothesis","Information retrieval","Linux","Logistic regression","Primitive recursive function","Query expansion","Relevance feedback","Text Retrieval Conference","Time complexity","Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["22add44f5c69f266a57b13a20321a1c3b9767e55","511e040ba116ced7517475dd21d7ebd0ac96bf8d","158f9e4e385645d2db3949483789cc84ceb41c3c","238ffd009affe0e67b915b5c9d9ca50549ecdccd","3f37c545a53f806e5df10998c01156c57bba5c28","d743b61fbdb8fb6397fd2cec20c261dff9e4a180","87a458977ae41f5069de1f8db347383e7693ece3","0496b636c5304ccd37321b5e04c13aadb9a5fbc0","39487bfa4482bafba996a92055b901f0cdc018a8","9b2acd4e8ea6f5fbb68fdcaef4e1c7a11b4e04fb","8101b548f5b2eae2591dfdd989f6c15b9a4cdefb","22d1e8ecaf4b42cd761aecbaf736190a6e680470","3c253331f4cf0535c7d517a05c7851b9c7544a4d"],"id":"324cfb619d94a3bb9857c8df44996d93e41852b3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/324cfb619d94a3bb9857c8df44996d93e41852b3","authors":[{"name":"Ali Montazeralghaem","ids":["3375353"]},{"name":"Hamed Zamani","ids":["2499986"]},{"name":"Azadeh Shakery","ids":["2887988"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080728"}

BioNex takes biomedical queries such as \"Ebola virus disease\" and retrieves the k most relevant news events for them. To achieve this we first mine the generic news events by clustering them on a daily basis using general named entities and textual features. These clusters are also tagged with disambiguated biomedical entities which aid in biomedical news event exploration.

Recommender systems automatically suggest items to users that might be interesting for them. Recent studies illustrate that incorporating social trust in Matrix Factorization methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust Metrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their interactions. In this paper, first we present how social relation can be extracted from users\u2019 ratings to items by describing Hellinger distance between users in recommender systems. Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted trust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social relation extraction from three wellknown real-world datasets, which both: trust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit social relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same performance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users. Hence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the state-ofthe-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the extracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the prediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information. The experimental results support the idea of employing implicit trust into matrix factorization whenever explicit trust is not available, can perform much better than the state-of-the-art approaches in user rating prediction. c © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.

For example, when does a tourist become a migrant? As a result, harmonizing across different kinds of estimates or data sources can be difficult. Moreover in countries like the United States, that do not have a national registry system, estimates of internal migration typically rely on survey data that can require over a year from data collection to publication. In addition, each survey can ask only a limited set questions about migration (e.g., where did you live a year ago? where did you live five years ago?). We leverage a sample of geo-referenced Twitter tweets for about 62,000 users, spanning the period between 2010 and 2016, to estimate a series of US internal migration flows under varying time intervals and durations. Our findings, expressed in terms of 'migration curves', document, for the first time, the relationships between short-term mobility and long-term migration. The results open new avenues for demographic research. More specifically, future directions include the use of migration curves to produce probabilistic estimates of long-term migration from short-term (and vice versa) and to nowcast mobility rates at different levels of spatial and temporal granularity using a combination of previously published American Community Survey data and up-to-date data from a panel of Twitter users.","inCitations":["97e6772ea02022990f474569207857dc585801dc","3a0f79cf4e08a44931243c10eaac50c610781f4d"],"pmid":"","title":"Using Twitter Data to Estimate the Relationship between Short-term Mobility and Long-term Migration","journalPages":"103-110","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://ingmarweber.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Using_Twitter_Data_to_Estimate_the_Relationship_between_Short-term_Mobility_and_Long-term_Migration.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091496"],"entities":["File spanning","System migration"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1ce00c09488829d6a386917f17cffb3cd47e30f6","5929b467d9c7136b2361b686a728a3cab4f7fcc1","9f1492af0dcdadfbdf4cf49b47df74ada63f7ad5","1db98c71324efa517cd0107d08e81195d4419629","42bb118724c902ffe90d6a565deb7def60096112","4bf034ec0f546ab28c0961fbe7a2ed7705af6579","848a994ef3062d6dec9015a2a779d3c070de486c","3ab6967b62554807bf65d7fc9af006763b9741d5","6ea1c802e09a7053409cc34d92d2f54b94a1f4b6","9ad1200bfbb4df99228fea6f7651a885c369a9b7","54da271835833a6860c0f5935160daefa30fdb55","246d1ec848c0e6879e0cdf2993eeefe48ca48029"],"id":"732bf8133a6bdea0c31fd36a7c7c74ab929af970","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/732bf8133a6bdea0c31fd36a7c7c74ab929af970","authors":[{"name":"Lee Fiorio","ids":["19277930"]},{"name":"Guy Abel","ids":["4207823"]},{"name":"Jixuan Cai","ids":["20647876"]},{"name":"Emilio Zagheni","ids":["2140221"]},{"name":"Ingmar Weber","ids":["1684687"]},{"name":"Guillermo Vinué","ids":["2293655"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091496"}

Usually there are many (not integrated) data sources, originating from different government bodies, in distinct formats and variable properties (e.g. reliability, completeness). The effort to handle these data, integrate and analyze them is high, taking to much time for the information to be available to help decision making. We argue that data from location-based social networks (LBSN) could be used to provide useful information in reasonable time, despite several limitations they have. To asses this, as a case study, we used data from different LBSN to calculate the Local Availability Index (IOL) for a Brazilian city. This index is part of a methodology to estimate quality of urban life inside cities and is used to support urban planning. The results suggest that data from LBSN are useful and could be used to provide insights for local governments.","inCitations":["0385ce7e5548b9d85121bedfb17e99e467be2d6b","fafffa56d097614c1e913c645cd68937ab6f72bc","7280a725a276fdf7505132f2be4d74599a6ed127"],"pmid":"","title":"Could Data from Location-Based Social Networks Be Used to Support Urban Planning?","journalPages":"1463-1468","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c9f2/908346cd208b0118432cefb09c8396fe96e9.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3051700","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1463.pdf"],"entities":["Location-based service","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c11d0ba3e581e691f1bee0022dc0807ff4c428f2","12e04dad4c983662d21ec499ef45fc5761c4ea75","6ba34f9ee0614a7f28a5e00adfd646ebfa526645","3444334c22b86abe13d19671955e48c161fd6c1d","351c9d86add9be9b8938fdf259373bf7751f17d8","713830bba983140b727f52ecd850d7f33ac28c03","e80c1f6b15b168b59676f43b6aa7dea7c5234673","13ca7d7278d187e2c6a55620d84d50f25b457931","1e02e76cc719733984868e75b9d8cf8ddb6e5291","0ef757c4bb4def6b4ea0ed1b4d2a9a53f2cac2c6","e1b26f4200dcaf98c16183613b07f2c1184fa549","1ecc43b139987e48cb9ee30013a954fd79382e8e","045f2e1e47f937dc12e2c646d1b4df0bc3f3bf10","78785a96d62e3503b791f7c5c6f62ba022772c0f","0d38443073e7d12c7f25e57e713181420c74bc76"],"id":"c9f2908346cd208b0118432cefb09c8396fe96e9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9f2908346cd208b0118432cefb09c8396fe96e9","authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Smarzaro","ids":["10304496"]},{"name":"Tiago França Melo de Lima","ids":["40569749"]},{"name":"Clodoveu A.

Here we study the problem of metric score adjustment, with the goal of accurately estimating system performance when using deep metrics and limited judgment sets, assuming that dynamic score adjustment is required per topic due to the variability in the number of relevant documents. We seek to induce system orderings that are as close as is possible to the orderings that would arise if full judgments were available. Starting with depth-based pooling, and no prior knowledge of sampling probabilities, the first phase of our two-stage process computes a background gain for each document based on rank-level statistics. The second stage then accounts for the distributional variance of relevant documents. We also exploit the frequency statistics of pooled relevant documents in order to determine a threshold for dynamically determining the set of topics to be adjusted. Taken together, our results show that: (i) better score estimates can be achieved when compared to previous work; (ii) by setting a global threshold, we are able to adapt our methods to different collections; and (iii) the proposed estimation methods reliably approximate the system orderings achieved when many more relevance judgments are available. We also consider pools generated by a two-strata sampling approach.","inCitations":["1f04c648d684c0af8b8289002189ec1f6c3d3cab","61a9d991413e112ee95ccdac177ec684738103bd","f7db53b60694ed860bd5a269606c72aa44e7e0ea"],"pmid":"","title":"Can Deep Effectiveness Metrics Be Evaluated Using Shallow Judgment Pools?","journalPages":"35-44","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080793","http://www.culpepper.io/publications/lmc17-sigir.pdf"],"entities":["Agent-based model","Approximation algorithm","Mathematical optimization","Relevance","Sampling (signal processing)","Spatial variability","Strati (automobile)","The Australian","The Good Judgment Project"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1260e6de04361b76d751d3a1049dea3f3f54dac8","355146c49d983f5c35c6033374a7252ac0141fd8","0e59a828d3abb342922e2e275e4dc39470af0712","580c9f1d9836b13164316fd832792d8bf59ed964","67526725638bbb8f389cbaef106756f40cc073b6","f82989fb843e58cd98569552c700eb07deabd3eb","bacff358bfd85a4673782c1f56f030283bdaa4e5","21529b32a59c213109b9704b7fbceb4197abb3b0","54d477a9f652000812e8f6b9f8c9096525d07b05","007165fe06a9ffcc67263dfe70f06b0ec0f09e2b","150a31a1d38d90acefb560c2a42efed1ae67f7f7","08badaad9669b69b16ce9437d0b2d52b5f33c8dd","f2928bc2fe1953fbe1e40621456d2ac57a70d729","0ddb8af211f2af018e8adf5affe8fc497f056e67","618ee0a69b0955509fb78f2a2263c33386a804cf","e7584e203f7811ae285f28eab8d1e81d72411227","99cb96ea60e27a1485b5a1d563e9181cf815136f","1150351d79e64f8768b5cbde00215478c7474aa8","405381203d858a4313f2b51efac69f0787f824d9","88fbf478fd5d0baa2c1d5cc6d0b7daea38893a89","e06ceef1cabae1c01f4f4bd1fcdb9ba7487d7977","e72e5664cdfd67bce833e0675f72a0f9daf6334f","dafc464a515d0fd81bc1c65728a39d1c957a9964","1b50c8353d9e4a241a5f4a9c0088eb9c5f593e1f","a71896950a2c3bd5c4d30b93f64c6d13cbcf408b","471cb4c2e5039bdaacb0274fee70c7fe2e93493e","5416ab359f9d024f582af3544a7b4baf877a625a"],"id":"b032c52507ecc9138ee795f4eb953690b1ef0599","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b032c52507ecc9138ee795f4eb953690b1ef0599","authors":[{"name":"Xiaolu Lu","ids":["40505029"]},{"name":"Alistair Moffat","ids":["1751760"]},{"name":"J.

Compared with the extensive study of user behavior in general Web search scenarios, there exists no thorough investigation how the different interaction mechanism of image search engines affects users' examination behavior. To shed light on this research question, we conducted an eye-tracking study to investigate users' examination behavior in image searches. We focus on the impacts of factors in examination including position, visual saliency, edge density, the existence of textual information, and human faces in result images. Three interesting findings indicate users' behavior biases: (1) instead of the traditional \"Golden Triangle'' phenomena in the user examination patterns of general Web search, we observe a middle-position bias, (2) besides the position factor, the content of image results (e.g., visual saliency) affects examination behavior, and (3) some popular behavior assumptions in general Web search (e.g., examination hypothesis) do not hold in image search scenarios. We predict users' examination behavior with different impact factors. Results show that combining position and visual content features can improve prediction in image searches.","inCitations":["54fef296e9c4d77906fbe9debe4e303276b69d92","dc69f55ab2d2f2ce57ff84f2006baf442089d95c","6b0ebbaea9e91d904b1923b470fbf9a49314f620","b21999ed0fa901eb79bd1bfc42dd8e3e1e69112f","e4d9ee8acba167ba761efceabf58543cbd3562f5","f8c64245541a6a8a2befd94a148ac17f12170652"],"pmid":"","title":"Investigating Examination Behavior of Image Search Users","journalPages":"275-284","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080799","http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/publications/sigir2017Xie.pdf"],"entities":["Eye tracking","Image retrieval","Landing page","Lazy evaluation","Mixed model","Mobile device","Relevance","Search engine results page","Time of arrival","Usability testing","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f591c9d0210a0ecfd98b8ae4bce943d42f636cb1","317654370830d9b20e1d78ea0489514a98ef3c56","0b3a95245d9cde45ffcce46b7280e9d12f175568","611f091db2785f855f181d22886f2c7f4c4afeba","0020f7b5ff3bd39c322ae8f8f7927d116e77d322","6d74c216d8246c2a356b00426af715102af2a172","857e7fce2e2f88ddb38935fa809aefa196689286","36f27559d12bd86d32fbe34f4b4ce7540f1686c0","4752e8858dd67002b16b281e115655307ec3c974","0b2d5a748db9f16e36375db6b1eb97a3c16d8c80","13d72ef522b405c18f7d228c5744687609b4c3a4","050f2c5ecdd39d261582b3e4aec8cf13c5d14ed0","7a43cdd0e8e4b628af6619812c73b2f2d524d0bb","17f3de3c51a323e081c384504a54d33d8ceb57c7","275b987cef19041cdfeecc89e509454329d2873e","9780b60c459d118ceed53cb8809958aa98434e58","7432e012c196a63fc4e21d66b7f16db7fed2a3b1","7a205e81af4547fa907bc3071b1e27e58a93828b","27ae5272e7d4c260b1af931c225b5b92cbc7e26d","70e896d590d58fe78d49038b20ce32b4c176ae6e","d237072bae2bb7ab3c0e3ea10959c05df5384311","79755ffd1d4a352029db8cd803858b336de3ddd4","31864e13a9b3473ebb07b4f991f0ae3363517244","a6d8e7592353729e5e1a5e5613e120379cb09053","8302d0746edee8b7d81648861395b565589f4ec7","63add5b09e70e5f2abf970f9d315421a67379cde","c23e9c620bc7bdb940d5458d2b7e53d36b8e3e7a","4cc5fb6cf48b2c58b283460b19f3beeb7e5b6a22","2d772cbd092d2b0869dcbfecadf70594a6d129e0","1772143a707f02685e3445485b89c888b2535e7a","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","6fb6ac49a9d3a4980c02504c3550ed52726ce61c"],"id":"749d0d639c133bd329d43cb8be47f9aba2063679","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/749d0d639c133bd329d43cb8be47f9aba2063679","authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Xie","ids":["2834988"]},{"name":"Yiqun Liu","ids":["1783406"]},{"name":"Xiaochuan Wang","ids":["50142626"]},{"name":"Meng Wang","ids":["48958393"]},{"name":"Zhijing Wu","ids":["47039225"]},{"name":"Yingying Wu","ids":["4942149"]},{"name":"Min Zhang","ids":["38898636"]},{"name":"Shaoping Ma","ids":["8093158"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080799"}

Together these create a very useful standard for reviewers, program committees, and journal editors; work in information retrieval (IR) increasingly cannot be published unless it has been evaluated using a well-constructed test collection and shown to produce a statistically significant improvement over a good baseline. But, as the saying goes, any tool sharp enough to be useful is also sharp enough to be dangerous. Statistical tests of significance are widely misunderstood. Most researchers and developers treat them as a \"black box\": evaluation results go in and a p-value comes out. But because significance is such an important factor in determining what research directions to explore and what is published, using p-values obtained without thought can have consequences for everyone doing research in IR. Ioannidis has argued that the main consequence in the biomedical sciences is that most published research findings are false; could that be the case in IR as well?","inCitations":["d26431d79555b5769c38abe9ca440fc221061b4d","82d484c392f8a6a183584bdaa512548ee9a57dde","a403f1eaf5677fa1000ba57448311f03675969a2","70408d4048685b03d2cbf0ec3f177ccaab5be051","1fb0f3742d809a5dcba653af0a323b6d233b2494","abf910540ebaae553402d584db296c00e436e0a4","9bf9d3a0c2e6ffb41b145d7f277f7a0d750eb478"],"pmid":"","title":"Statistical Significance Testing in Information Retrieval: Theory and Practice","journalPages":"1387-1389","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3082065"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Black box","Information retrieval","Randomness","Text Retrieval Conference"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a7f7d48eab5d33df15caa0f2ce891a5477292524","d08f38f004cc02f3184a4743fdf4e5ed6669ac05","162c68e07814704109122d61771c1ce067e95b86","0eff8ad003a87b5e62fe02eaecb20b0bc853078f","a2c7e4f81ba626646d1a1bb73b1f500976a26b53","caffca6fed87623b75924b521047318dcb5dedf0","8f9ca2393da66340489ec5a909a6afebe227c16d","213225e01a07a8fab60a67e1605186babc328c0c","37c35b41bfcfbc85d0509b085b2d103c64e2af41","9e5c8edc5e1a66a92b74dc87a976bfcd0824b611","150a31a1d38d90acefb560c2a42efed1ae67f7f7","790d1886c36d56f4c8a14473a01c0a607c612c4c","c300d60e26ef5413310e2fe8dab2b96e37bd9e4a","7635e691d173387ee90c89e88c6c40b0d2a81cda","10a94694e197ae7bb718451df199d2a1b5246cc9","11ec8ea58b5386cf3b54f5bf5a19d8b2fbdec903","7c2b0044fb08a19d2eedce2ba8949cda22d888b0","329f32eade62a1814ab53769056241d388f5b39f","3ee1ecb2d8d6f2f2cf0343752a71755b37ea9875","1bbb160a886b61113f3ce494af055d1568e30594","185c71cbca46aa1c811198e46e53692cbcec8a52","2dce110085044c913d6c3bf70aaf27345ffb23d1","bc235a9276abf1235e2c67af73d3eb536fea6f45","376df6d148a4c549f95f2f252c8a3819c36eb491","4314bbc2a62c37a9b66d759fc35ae6f7607344e0","343d34eec23377d6745bde10759cbfecf7a22c84","755a046d695c25277f00fa4337864768bca3f19c"],"id":"5393d969d3c2ed372bcc67cc15668a94c73bade4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5393d969d3c2ed372bcc67cc15668a94c73bade4","authors":[{"name":"Ben Carterette","ids":["1750995"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3082065"}

An ethnographic approach is taken through the use of observation, interviews and documentary sources over the course of several weeks in collaboration with web archivists, engineers and managers at the Internet Archive - a private, non-profit digital library that has been archiving the Web since 1996. The concept of web archival labour is proposed to encompass and highlight the ways in which web archivists (as both networked human and non-human agents) shape and maintain the preserved Web through work that is often embedded in and obscured by the complex technical arrangements of collection and access. As a result, this engagement positions web archives as places of knowledge and cultural production in their own right, revealing new insights into the performative nature of web archiving that have implications for how these data are used and understood.1","inCitations":["9f01a3a02f69fe2021a8c4390bd3211f0d762e19"],"pmid":"","title":"Observing Web Archives: The Case for an Ethnographic Study of Web Archiving","journalPages":"299-308","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/410123/1/Ogdenetal_WebSci17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091506"],"entities":["Archive","Complex system","Data point","Digital curation","Digital library","Embedded system","File archiver","Gamification","Hyperlink","Logic programming","Online and offline","Pattern matching","Wayback Machine","Web archiving","Web resource","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["fcef42ec55707402fdc880c39be0709b63150551","f51f3d24b3f52a2290a36cf79a5e738bf6afa9c3","ae5e232f4c89712d707765eb5a653c6f352aba31","9cfcd2dfe7927451f2c39617e6ac0aa499fd2edb","3881fd5b74ac35205a4735fde98c134ee47796d4","e786d3ea67e3234e9e66832ff187a735b779faf8","a48419e179b4958f0c175cfe6077e4061b743419","1798bfe4a3a81b86fb4e68c26415ec5ac632a6db","5a1f0f0609323d0e6967e602f718dd4edfd57f61","914f2f4f5d700d85e4b0481226b4f06dbb28a647","5f051b4f97a10a25b6a9e6a36a09ea95c9207449","9e9c9e96cb16727fc6cd938ab1035ce08b1c8368","1e7b3c87ab21b57da33bf2403adc049cfed63cbd","96ee3e5aaf535370a39c16fcf38af95907d5ab8f","7f23e86082befcdfe88d9b173c00d05a35ea5de3","38462c1ed106c55ac6f4a2729ef639d9b4e83537","9f49dee4fd3ddb63cb774c62f7cb7c82eb7560fd","7019858e13c231b428d3e3509929f491ba08d1e7","a8151123996be099b699dc22e1ae82bce33e6874","3ad05b1efe437c4000ff0d27699a8f3be6ae4956","1dacf55b73bb9dd0f96f887cdfc543fc91ec887a","3936d0a1734f6635203dad2d84a4a9f1dca4c610","2d6c813a9220a93e0e1f34b3c61bfa87e0b60b4e","7b4a919766f5064f40cc9fbeadedd326d75e3d38","fdca9c0df5735f76f06587e1c720c07b79636e30","8e11123f36617a294e62ed0bafe6f5aee26d1244","062d39f182d94545c60394c98bc8abde80764d7a","3e3ef622a58123a69a9ab80c8dbadf12dc710a5f"],"id":"a8d13bfa289734fe57de133ca0f082f5c74c58d9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a8d13bfa289734fe57de133ca0f082f5c74c58d9","authors":[{"name":"Jessica Ogden","ids":["31919943"]},{"name":"Susan Halford","ids":["2020931"]},{"name":"Les Carr","ids":["1727183"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091506"}

This could be an end of story, especially if we were not computer scientists Who are making those advertisements and why? As we know that the television networks make money by broadcasting tv commercial to their viewers. They use the money to create contents and make profit. Therefore, it is obvious that we watch commercial to watch their shows. Of course, some ad-free television networks make funds from monthly subscription fee. But why do we feel that we see more ads online than before? Are we right about it? The answer is Yes. We are seeing more ads than before and it is not only because we spend more time online but also because more marketing money has shifted from offline to online marketing. The increase in digital marketing is due to several reasons; 1) increase of time spent online 2) descent of publishers' offline business 3) innovations in digital advertising technology and creatives. In this talk, I will talk about the history of digital advertising and the recent innovations in advertising technologies to make ads more relevant to individual viewer.

This source of information has been ignored by most of the current recommender systems while it can potentially alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN significantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of

In this paper, we learn sentence representations by means of a siamese network, which: (i) uses encoders that share parameters; and (ii) enables the comparison between two sentences in terms of their euclidean distance, by minimizing a contrastive loss. Moreover, we add a multilayer perceptron in the architecture to simultaneously optimize the contrastive and the logistic losses. This way, our network can exploit a more informative feedback, given by the logistic loss, which is also quantified by the distance that the two sentences have according to their representation in the euclidean space. We show that jointly minimizing the two losses yields higher accuracy than minimizing them independently. We verify this finding by evaluating several baseline architectures in two sentence matching tasks: question paraphrasing and textual entailment recognition. Our network approaches the state of the art, while being much simpler and faster to train, and with less parameters than its competitors.","inCitations":["73edd8f4a310c1738be1bc95b0df79ce1ffdd5d7","b51b31ceda442405fd37533ab83c9f920ebb3f4f","d4e8dc10b82dff22ed26564d19fde7095336069a","ed0157421edf02b1a59ba714c8b84187651a188e"],"pmid":"","title":"Accurate Sentence Matching with Hybrid Siamese Networks","journalPages":"2235-2238","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133156"],"entities":["Analysis of algorithms","Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Encoder","Euclidean distance","Information","Loss functions for classification","Memory-level parallelism","Multilayer perceptron","Textual entailment"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1a1f388942a84ea9f2fbf54672428b6d2488ce65","07a9478e87a8304fc3267fa16e83e9f3bbd98b27","10006e256a25b331bdf1011da325c5ed8362cef2","b9d220520a5da7d302107aacfe875b8e2977fdbe","0c133f79b23e8c680891d2e49a66f0e3d37f1466","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","35b11ac652646c70a559f7ae29295e1d5de09a80","0dab72129b4458d9e3dbf1f109848c2d6d7af8a8","6d5e12ee5d75d5f8c04a196dd94173f96dc8603f","62a97ac04e742ad1513cf164760e4d6a25d93203","0af737eae02032e66e035dfed7f853ccb095d6f5","6f1b6007638724124e2763f818ee4ebf2da3ae86","7525a935870ea47979e4539edf88da865669bc2e","6812fb9ef1c2dad497684a9020d8292041a639ff","3e555b6054aa6fd4b46f87cd632668aaf8a91db6","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","1f94734847c15fa1da68d4222973950d6b683c9e","515a554d001a53ba58fe5f83c6fb73556b396191","68e4aedc69518d8db2f143bd3952668aa41c762c","0f32cd9cf29ec55b9a54dd5a4adf80b03e0ac08d","4b8089bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2","e1969f3b5ae3e7d92f64cbcbe2a01a1d07e099c5","29c19276b8fff231717c3e342cb24144d2b77726"],"id":"1236520cdd3f6d8a6e623d7a34daa4327149cbea","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1236520cdd3f6d8a6e623d7a34daa4327149cbea","authors":[{"name":"Massimo Nicosia","ids":["1735421"]},{"name":"Alessandro Moschitti","ids":["1719404"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133156"}

However, classical methods for inferring topic models do not scale up to the massive size of today's publicly available Web-scale data sets. The state-of-the-art approaches rely on custom strategies, implementations and hardware to facilitate their asynchronous, communication-intensive workloads. We present APS-LDA, which integrates state-of-the-art topic modeling with cluster computing frameworks such as Spark using a novel asynchronous parameter server. Advantages of this integration include convenient usage of existing data processing pipelines and eliminating the need for disk writes as data can be kept in memory from start to finish. Our goal is not to outperform highly customized implementations, but to propose a general high-performance topic modeling framework that can easily be used in today's data processing pipelines. We compare APS-LDA to the existing Spark LDA implementations and show that our system can, on a 480-core cluster, process up to 135× more data and 10× more topics without sacricing model quality.","inCitations":["d79a9757a506cf69f4fd4ea9b92d55e739ede3bd"],"pmid":"","title":"Computing Web-scale Topic Models using an Asynchronous Parameter Server","journalPages":"1337-1340","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07422v3.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07422","http://cake.da.inf.ethz.ch/clueweb-topicmodels/sigir2017.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3084135","https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/jagerman-computing-2017.pdf"],"entities":["Asynchronous I/O","Computer cluster","Exploratory search","Information retrieval","Latent Dirichlet allocation","Local-density approximation","Pipeline (computing)","Server (computing)","Smoothing","Topic model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0de0c3240bda7972bd0a3c8369ebc4b4f2e4f9c2","2466407dddb5b1a15f1885721390ac24953fa39a","8221960b3475409830a33ccb0f7760de8514028d","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","32192d744d86e7cde73f0c9aa773214f88619a9e","0122e063ca5f0f9fb9d144d44d41421503252010","239243dfa44e14b4fca15675d25cb655fb91a7b7","0558c94a094158ecd64f0d5014d3d9668054fb97","07713a3daa1a0d8431b8997f677634f7e84b05a8","157aef34d39c85d6576028f29df1ea4c6480a979","30e94e24d67994c5a8e2f20f852a51d28a720de2","61202eb74184c0d75276954c93ce774c72f8035d","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1"],"id":"a21a323532c4e32acd455d2c6345ee5ec54a200f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a21a323532c4e32acd455d2c6345ee5ec54a200f","authors":[{"name":"Rolf Jagerman","ids":["1886219"]},{"name":"Carsten Eickhoff","ids":["1764160"]},{"name":"Maarten de Rijke","ids":["1696030"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3084135"}

To speed up subgraph query answering on graph databases, indexes are commonly used. State-of-the-art graph database indexes do not adapt or scale well to dynamic graph database use; they are static, and their ability to prune possible search responses to meet user needs worsens over time as databases change and grow. Users can re-mine indexes to gain some improvement, but it is time consuming. Users must also tune numerous parameters on an ongoing basis to optimize performance and can inadvertently worsen the query response time if they do not choose parameters wisely. Recently, a one-pass algorithm has been developed to enhance the performance of frequent subgraphs based indexes by using the algorithm to update them regularly. However, there are some drawbacks, most notably the need to make updates as the query workload changes.\n In this paper, we propose a new index based on graph-coarsening to speed up subgraph query answering time in dynamic graph databases. Our index is parameter-free, query-independent, scalable,small enough to store in the main memory, and is simpler and less costly to maintain for database updates. Experimental results show that our index outperforms hybrid-indexes (i.e. indexes updated with one-pass) for query answering time in the case of social network databases, and is comparable with these indexes for frequent and infrequent queries on chemical databases. Our index can be updated up to 60 times faster in comparison to one-pass on dynamic graph databases. Moreover, our index is independent of the query workload for index update and is up to 15 times faster after hybrid-indexes are attuned to query workload.","inCitations":["436fbc3d9bae32389f207366d070ca8d176ce6c4"],"pmid":"","title":"A Scalable Graph-Coarsening Based Index for Dynamic Graph Databases","journalPages":"207-216","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3133003"],"entities":["Chemical database","Computer data storage","Graph (discrete mathematics)","Graph database","One-pass algorithm","Response time (technology)","Scalability","Social network","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["bf149231ec7c2864223ef2ba01203872ad6bd92b","1db18e3c8395e24bbba5a8dafd64101319754152","4cdcd362871985d8ae659f45cefeb744baed7972","0fd8b558eb2251d6f8da7f44bdb28bd12a76c95a","6439e8c8d7f1a11c50d66dca1c2fd5afc655488b","09ec01dee0c158a7bd0174d28d28d61af52d82c2","021abd34e933f03f6ba5a832e484ff0d57946732","a63da7a39752c2632908fbc648e83a19f2310191","1c3fc5358131fc02e8f8bf6b14dbe88a255da4cb","c162829cd2c6c7bdb55bbd2b67b83dc643ad7602","87507a498558ed6ed23115a42f42376c0884f7f2","2baeba7ab9582c922c0a6b34417d6286b2b44870","1de3c8ddf30b9d6389aebc3bfa8a02a169a7368b","5e736041fda5433b5f671b6f340d917d6213a334","38ea65db88ee93c19a7a1bccaf0065cea4d90a81","b8a5d2ab3a1f57ac55cbc3b9f9dee3b809c71fea","065768efd97490012f2bc22fea80bf68aa2dad02","92529b82fe5ed16bcde024f647e230af8e1847e5","077b10bfd8602db4ef440783a9131ba0674d8260","e52c061e94c610424fb8639d754c8d18276403e7","53799b9b42c8fe3a5126687ab013689db58bd929","da355c6cfe2499108ee6a1b228f7396eaec91a11"],"id":"cdadc2aa758d3abc1f77add07232f21df9287162","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cdadc2aa758d3abc1f77add07232f21df9287162","authors":[{"name":"Akshay Kansal","ids":["31435894"]},{"name":"Francesca Spezzano","ids":["1794160"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133003"}

In particular, we regard each user as a training instance, and heuristically choose a subset of accurate and diverse items as groundtruth for each user. We then represent each user or item as a vector resulted from the factorization of the user-item rating matrix. In our paper, we try to discover a factorization for matching the following supervised learning task. In doing this, we define two coupled optimization problems, parameterized matrix factorization and structural learning, to formulate our task. And we propose a diversified collaborative filtering algorithm (DCF) to solve the coupled problems. We also introduce a new pairwise accuracy metric and a normalized topic coverage diversity metric to measure the performance of accuracy and diversity respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the performance gains of DCF in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.","inCitations":["0477823fd5536e11e37638a46d4212de145eb3da","7c126e8f0115d8a7f5b53d526cdd2ca2c4feb198","aa39e845a8dc4af95d16f93f3cd904a91f4564a4","11b0993e09d767818ea9cd40f18439fed9fa10e9","b764d0070d07957d4b9621988ea3d020e9ecbe36","aee9357d655c5854e9a1efecfa960735a12f98f1","66dd92ea7281b696221bf044a999649a6732cd01"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning to Recommend Accurate and Diverse Items","journalPages":"183-192","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cbfc/dad2b0c58443113acf80b1830e60164b8016.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p183.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052585"],"entities":["Algorithm","Benchmark (computing)","Collaborative filtering","Design rule for Camera File system","Experiment","Heuristic","Mathematical optimization","Supervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["22bf66441dd0fb73e4d8563ddd56c962bfd38735","23bbea130398331084021cc895a132064219b4b1","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","75cca03b03dc514f03c102ccfdd53a7c0af625fc","e84e9f82f49eb5a21cdf2306e42478773ff9e82a","e3a9b5b2a24307b133578424a636a486a7b1e37f","e84823aba38797f8b6c3cff9e677c4b85296a57e","29671a0b2e8ed39f11d3535340ad59089cd40757","42edd85b1618ccec9577ae286ce2521c62b75a53","a83cb80dd4ed5160c66dbd31c7782b01e7a97170","20aa9c0c17ce85ff2eeac313f02e835e14e7c593","1a932850aa9b155bffef3c52e6b51633cf2f1956","100e6ac4215956869103850dcb078eed638d366f","a72f412d336d69a82424cb7d610bb1bb9d81ef7c","040a872a47ea76127111a1262c8e8685736951e3","87765820abd62577444dc498a15f30e306ea4403","64edd2c5c41e856695e1dcb950c0512c3a87edec","3cd71c991b418d47680e7c5894ef5b1e793f0627","15004aadabd967ac722a28a9c3bb39cf5bc32605","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","333e3e7d801abc8ba6500ebee28ec3d4e7a19842","098c57f75479813c2cdc848ab16ef41d87353702","12d10a13c9ee6e0c8e7478593608880d1a558060","95ed9e883b6321658b95a8db28d0704e90973a9d","e0cf9c51192f63c3a9e3b23aa07ee5654fc97b68","28592229e9e3fe69d18c260b279c2309d1276863","2ba6c04eaef488d5a6d8bb2ff3d19c44facbf1b4","06fd8b6fccf2b71e0e7b69b2bb2b78910e2110ac","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","93ab05bea8836de13c602374c9ba2d41256ad273","900874be4d48f919434a3107d959e57a55bc286c"],"id":"cbfcdad2b0c58443113acf80b1830e60164b8016","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cbfcdad2b0c58443113acf80b1830e60164b8016","authors":[{"name":"Peizhe Cheng","ids":["2423508"]},{"name":"Shuaiqiang Wang","ids":["2386396"]},{"name":"Jun Ma","ids":["35729719"]},{"name":"Jiankai Sun","ids":["2282025"]},{"name":"Hui Xiong","ids":["1707713"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052585"}

We present a distant supervision approach addressing this challenge without using explicitly labeled data. We use plausibly good but imperfect definition sentences from Wikipedia as references to annotate sentences in a target corpus based on text similarity measures such as ROUGE. Experimental results show our approach is highly effective, generating noisy but large, useful, and localized training instances. Definition sentence retrieval models trained using the synthesized training examples are more effective than those learned from manual judgments of a few thousand sentences. We also examine different text similarity measures for annotation, including both unsupervised and supervised ones. We show that our method can significantly benefit from supervised text similarity measures learned from either external training data (from the SemEval Semantic Text Similarity task) or local ones (a few hundred judged sentences on the target corpus). Our method offers a cheap, effective, and flexible solution to this task and can benefit a broad range of applications such as web search engines and QA systems.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Similarity-based Distant Supervision for Definition Retrieval","journalPages":"527-536","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://maroo.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1221","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3133032"],"entities":["Heuristic","ROUGE (metric)","SIM lock","SemEval","Software quality assurance","Supervised learning","Text corpus","Unsupervised learning","Web search engine","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["605fa6d94be36542eadef05a5e3b3cfa1ec37fec","4e60a6056457916eaebf91d90ae53b72d04a6c16","45fc709a2fb8cd3cc71462c65e3d5e1bcb23c444","17e4c300ed70a92b404b2cee297d6a634fbe733d","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","045c633ba4829add9d69b34224cb9347aa1acd6a","67fc461fac073d0669f5a56ec96f9df35e050429","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","8b302ae180547430d9201aae1cbde5e0852a623b","2504669f9c9f79352a83dc554fda61d41c5e0736","09ebe623a28cfef73c06ffdf8eadc6cd9b6f97e9","d333fdfcc56483336f0428e48bc11cd26cac28d8","e0fb3ab6dfdf9c351e2c837e480850b4186aa961","255e97d82f528b613dbe8883727abfd14f3f9f39","1aa88d275eaa0746031dcd567e4c1a6777a13e37","604809686a977df714f76b823d4fce48e67ee3ba","8ff93cfd37dced279134c9d642337a2085b31f59","3946979cb1ac2737c14208958e92f8cd2698d44d","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","45cf7ea736444e2fefc0ccbaf598abd110fabf0d","233d861338cfcd479b1d21897453fcc66418d5e1","1a9f9dadd29466b47dfa3ae4aa9f6b47fce336bd","2c9ade5f79ca1fb68672fcf90716aaeebe160554","2d02141fd8c263d9c9a05d704c2d3e38525a7167","663f992b63e1cbbbea022856c15bcd4453af6d1a","3e555b6054aa6fd4b46f87cd632668aaf8a91db6","8f8139b63a2fc0b3ae8413acaef47acd35a356e0","04d458a49065e9cad46b243d004436a9cede3483","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","a75e912a1712776f33239bef3c432c669f442a62","9a75ef477b09fb868ee80c76602efa9e03696a67","70cb232a6e391bfa49b0441a9956820c52ec32f2","96e3b0e98705143ba0364b82a418025a123a6727","fc8431ac49d63179ab80817e05a8f3de461ce31f","364220e42ab6d60c5e44d4d0d7758bd83c4b82bd","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2","20ad0ba7e187e6f335a08c59a4e53da4e4b027ec"],"id":"2db030d076574c854cbe6252e207a63d48bdb060","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2db030d076574c854cbe6252e207a63d48bdb060","authors":[{"name":"Jiepu Jiang","ids":["1730464"]},{"name":"James Allan","ids":["1722517"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133032"}

Mining big social networks aims to collect and analyze web-scale social data to reveal patterns of individual and group behaviors. It is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from sociology, psychology, statistics, and graph theory. In this article, I briefly survey recent progress on social network mining with an emphasis on understanding the interactions among users in the large dynamic social networks. I will start with some basic knowledge for social network analysis, including methodologies and tools for macro-level, meso-level and microlevel social network analysis. Then I will give an overall roadmap of social network mining. After that, I will describe methodologies for modeling user behavior including state-of-the-art methods for learning user profiles, and introduce recent progress on modeling dynamics of user behaviors using deep learning. Then I will present models and algorithms for quantitative analysis on social interactions including homophily and social influence.Finally, I will introduce network structure model including social group formation, and network topology generation. We will introduce recent developed network embedding algorithms for modeling social networks with the embedding techniques. Finally, I will use several concrete examples from Alibaba, the largest online shopping website in the world, and WeChat, the largest social messaging service in China, to explain how online social networks influence our offline world.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Computational Models for Social Network Analysis: A Brief Survey","journalPages":"921-925","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3ec7/04bc0688b33b248db41d665c12955c552ad8.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p921.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3051101"],"entities":["Algorithm","Computation","Computer simulation","Deep learning","Graph theory","Interaction","Mesoscopic physics","Network topology","Online and offline","Online shopping","Social media","Social messaging","Social network analysis","Time complexity","User profile"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3581ff32946ed9ed07be8e307bffd57d3b8d995e","46225772ac4f68a003a26f053bb248d77c7dbf87","cb107cd268bf4f34760000e4b23b1f08b4fc604d","231d0ecb5a33eae8495f646a985cc14e209fbfb2","14bf5eec662109371eb45b6028a9160a2efb9cad","1339b888fb739b8a1194fa94fbe848e01d93456a","4cd73382dc17561cd276f276c61d5ebf39bf69ad","53a34df7523f41a86aa7078c7c4758361d8c417e","7d2902c17ee53a758a3973e17ca056d69922f44c","29ecb8899c8d8d6a5aedcf2c66d26aac14335584","2b8223081984697d93ec40cd6280f89bc8abc81d","00f1ee4a4264480edc8355a26b8dfbbdfc2b33aa","3c4e5d8773e0897df1767c26a176b5cb43dad5e6","2628a4ab8be64bdc71d6cf9d537586d28053db86","04080a4fc2cb3316d63e9f6e8161873be21f6637","6d70e92a79c18c3e3b28e3b64168d3266abb15a4","0fedb3f3459bb591c3c2e30beb7dd0a9d3af3bcc","70b992c5d563b6fd198997dae32c2bc7cc78fb80","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","bce3a871f856f815e8747254b8015190d171756b","1562d6e590aac6e754ce750190ef17060c4a1e93","858cdf1ad6822e644c53c7751f9b5bda40104262","d18dbfb3f45fa340bddf927a8742752470a0d6c7","19d8f0036e3ea909e5650fe7129225e3d935d6ba","29efbdf3f95cee97405accafdebd3bd374f1f003","1001b274f1d7ab16b26a871745b4918999d6d528","0658a573bea01c3926d44f510c637a8314cc52ed","03587af06fede4b609c3c9b93d1cc8953479e98e","64f5531503102cefa7f15e0d2ab4198ec5c9b94a","2123ed696a89439ec5d274095f3f5e356e22d2b6","559c425ad114a01f0ce52a81a8e5f1304006d07b","b11b021b93cc17e4141d4ad41a9acb66fecc7bed","0c4228375c481194f7521a503c912d1405d9129c","2dc147a786e305958987c2cab59ffb58a64ea97b","188dfb1f7293c2c3ec96f1f0bff2e57e3b08cf54","443db113d1fd18ffd0a06f79bb30f75200c1b857","16bd1fbe3694173eda4ad4338a85f8288d19bf02","0a1590b4cb21c0348822808e73187280941fdb18","85df2962687b45df1552b3929e4069cd24385fa7","67dc9b7c747436f9c8e74813d0ad4098428b2647","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","08a075443b26746bef0feaf4e8562d02164fa3d1","2a005868b79511cf8c924cd5990e2497527a0527","4d0ee5766ab4cdf5c99242ca1b574f7a2078aa4d","aad9c378dc1485957ae8d661596462b2ec16ab24","28bf0df09f97e7ef9108e71b45fe1b9a7aa201e2","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","5c6005ea3753b8a5209b402e2ba1e64f466141c5","327acf1aa52e75136ae9c39895c118190680ae35","0ff9c0c8426fe8508f8356dfd4af3bfc6fde76c8","21968ae000669eb4cf03718a0d97e23a6bf75926","35a908de3148658ed64e05f20d3a0c692b1cb971","45d84d67870fc5de3b0747d05d9971d750604e7e","852bc8cf86fcd0a9e6d1d71246b13ea5e09db8d2","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","2b98beb92b3fd808571d42d3514ff916a0a17366","9b90cb4aea40677494e4a3913878e355c4ae56e8","480b1e3419d38363604016a2746f3f9b3bdc7de6","471e9d18671d713528bf2255eba68476d5acdf2f","cb2d40cf9da942ef6caea22f21378fa4df3a0dc8","159fb65fca4bc9d989b2bfd01166ecbb8025867d"],"id":"3ec704bc0688b33b248db41d665c12955c552ad8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ec704bc0688b33b248db41d665c12955c552ad8","authors":[{"name":"Jie Tang","ids":["13436774"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3051101"}

We found that despite the weak regret-based assumptions, the results were (at least) as accurate as those obtained using classic equilibrium-based assumptions. En route we studied to what extent humans actually minimize regret in our ad auction, and found a significant difference between the \u201chigh types\u201d (players with a high valuation) who indeed rationally minimized regret and the \u201clow types\u201d who significantly overbid. We suggest that correcting for these biases and adjusting the regret-based econometric method may improve the accuracy of estimated values.","inCitations":["a83f686afe5b8d967b69c93c88713d78f69610ee","514c03a1c91e2869bb6f832b15279e4e2a474339","7617b0efc530b933af4fe3957805f1a94706f666"],"pmid":"","title":"An Experimental Evaluation of Regret-Based Econometrics","journalPages":"73-81","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fa2f/bb81ca44a7854c19c572419787f5988b38d8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03838v2.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p73.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03838","http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~gali_n/regret.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03838v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052621","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03838"],"entities":["Regret (decision theory)","Value (ethics)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["00f9c44adc5ac58ba010acda6642e904671b4568","2f83f3a933a964a8e601ac5c4bf7a4a25118cc91","a07f7be8c60e1fee7bd6335fbea315794ebf4488","55bfe5aa4d80da4ca3ceebf03ce97df21c773f73","6fb5142dc60256ad0cea7051be23fb94eb27ccc0","79d3c8b1f7723e3c023c09d909bec0277351a356","6a2e6ceca80ab04a9992aeb044aa25ea2f7a3f46","a4afe0a27f860ffac573c0f2ae9f9a3b8c9ad456","7617b0efc530b933af4fe3957805f1a94706f666"],"id":"082c34cb258c675e65888859d0667b394b00f52e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/082c34cb258c675e65888859d0667b394b00f52e","authors":[{"name":"Noam Nisan","ids":["1689609"]},{"name":"Gali Noti","ids":["3358318"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052621"}

From extraction through internal representation and storage, class labels and facts are treated as if they carved out disconnected slices within the larger space of factual knowledge. This paper argues that class labels and facts pertaining to an instance exist in symbiosis rather than as a dichotomy. A constituent (Costa Rican) within a class label (Costa Rican short story writers) of an instance may be indicative of a fact (nationality: Costa Rica) applicable to the instance and vice-versa. As an illustration of the relationship between class labels and facts, the paper introduces an open-domain method for the better understanding of the semantics of class labels in one of the larger and most widely-used repositories of knowledge, namely the categories in the Wikipedia category network.

In such sites, most of the user-generated content is written informally \u2013 the same word is often spelled differently by different users, and words are shortened arbitrarily due to the length limitations on microblogs. Stemming is a common step for improving retrieval performance by unifying different morphological variants of a word. In this study, we show that rule-based stemming meant for formal text often cannot capture the arbitrary variations of words in microblogs. We propose a context-specific stemming algorithm, based on word embeddings, which can capture many more variations of words than what can be detected by conventional stemmers. Experiments on a large set of English microblogs posted during a recent disaster event shows that, the proposed stemming gives considerably better retrieval performance compared to Porter stemming.","inCitations":["655c5b49d1aba9755acf6b3728dc018f3c2eaf20","a4c34567626b119c3b267c24439a93a439a4dd35","d907f8e42a858c68f147667644d5f5234abc76c7"],"pmid":"","title":"A Novel Word Embedding Based Stemming Approach for Microblog Retrieval During Disasters","journalPages":"589-597","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/413c/8a23d675580b59695e97e38d9e6d822fbbe8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://itra.medialabasia.in/data/Documents/DISARM/publications/2017_03_01_10_38FA1P8I-A%20Novel%20Word%20Embedding%20Based%20Stemming%20Approach.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_53"],"entities":["Academy","Algorithm","Experiment","Logic programming","Real-time data","Stemming","String metric","User-generated content","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ef8ba3144657601c29ef096e35a162bb164f8c0c","03a00248b7d5e2d89f5337e62c39fad277c66102","5dc9c8ff1627a76d7237fe87da027b16d069d4d1","73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","7c8d9a14fe6758aa704d7df6b8cf0637e3e1d66f","22272f8b59ebbac76fb53a71d76b5f1dc113d1fe","c7ba20a46ddefed391655e2c60292d1b4382474a","0826c98d1b1513aa2f45e6654bb5075a58b64649"],"id":"413c8a23d675580b59695e97e38d9e6d822fbbe8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/413c8a23d675580b59695e97e38d9e6d822fbbe8","authors":[{"name":"Moumita Basu","ids":["39954837"]},{"name":"Anurag Roy","ids":["9534640"]},{"name":"Kripabandhu Ghosh","ids":["40655940"]},{"name":"Somprakash Bandyopadhyay","ids":["31897723"]},{"name":"Saptarshi Ghosh","ids":["34062296"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_53"}

These representations could help us better measure the relationship strengths between regions, and the relationships can be used to better model the region properties. Different from existing studies, we propose to consider both temporal dynamics and multi-hop transitions in learning the region representations. We propose to jointly learn the representations from a flow graph and a spatial graph. Such a combined graph could simulate individual movements and also addresses the data sparsity issue. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using three different real datasets.","inCitations":["149f9475116182c74bab66047aca0797f7bb93fc","94d94ac23d94f007f1f2c6ee225c115ea72e04fd","c5deea5b67e332f3bb57fa98dba9587c4824a08a","9ee8d4e332ef3ed01e3ee7f8e3a9f071fb341b11","4eac8a81d0567b0362ad6f7b3c48cfafa2b6dccf","0e5a5a376bb250668b0bda3413db6173dc23ae00"],"pmid":"","title":"Region Representation Learning via Mobility Flow","journalPages":"237-246","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jessieli/Publications/2017-CIKM-region-embedding.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133006"],"entities":["CRIME","Graph embedding","IBM Notes","Machine learning","Simulation","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","0b35eeb1ca1fcaa24ef456242bb90320afdd1cd2","20739c96ed44ccfdc5352ea38e1a2a15137363f4","842b67c187777485bf9427c2f8e4f2398b8cf673","12e04dad4c983662d21ec499ef45fc5761c4ea75","4abc3ace7ba0d108279b1cee7d34677476181d15","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","1908f376b73f9726325300bcd90a6780503d084c","3eaca435527a765572ed04acd06ba512faac89eb","1acd47fc3ce5e66320017ea018d9bd525fe27906","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","1fcfa9be6fb3a444deafcda2824cf6624f2ae6a6","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","e70ea69235165625cc8e973d9a388bf67fb23389","0826c98d1b1513aa2f45e6654bb5075a58b64649","191dee77e470207e34ab5e76602009615016a73e","2414283ed14ebb0eec031bb75cd25fbad000687e"],"id":"a0d42acae9d5d856c8f20f65f417e2c55c6547ef","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a0d42acae9d5d856c8f20f65f417e2c55c6547ef","authors":[{"name":"Hongjian Wang","ids":["24697844"]},{"name":"Zhenhui Li","ids":["1717163"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133006"}

Our proposed method models item content via a topic model, and user communities via an autoencoder model, while bridging a user's community-based preference to her topic-based preference.

In contrast to many search tasks, the objectives of product search are not confined to retrieving relevant products. Instead, it focuses on finding items that satisfy the needs of individuals and lead to a user purchase. The unique characteristics of product search make search personalization essential for both customers and e-shopping companies. Purchase behavior is highly personal in online shopping and users often provide rich feedback about their decisions (e.g. product reviews). However, the severe mismatch found in the language of queries, products and users make traditional retrieval models based on bag-of-words assumptions less suitable for personalization in product search. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical embedding model to learn semantic representations for entities (i.e. words, products, users and queries) from different levels with their associated language data. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) our work is one of the initial studies on personalized product search; (2) our hierarchical embedding model is the first latent space model that jointly learns distributed representations for queries, products and users with a deep neural network; (3) each component of our network is designed as a generative model so that the whole structure is explainable and extendable. Following the methodology of previous studies, we constructed personalized product search benchmarks with Amazon product data. Experiments show that our hierarchical embedding model significantly outperforms existing product search baselines on multiple benchmark datasets.","inCitations":["3ae5bef6b0c8317603a2deab2527383580904fd8","3bb2a5e883bb17563f763055e27837e19ae01761","c1a2a640da8a0a4b026e00611ed8341c161f49fb","c446971a5f2ca9825e97725f7f7d53311c1a1368","43642a638cae87af650f9acf65eb75d6b1f4a733","6a1d1c100ad3ebcace07048876414673c9c07613","02019b7f146cdf81ae899f146731618e3f9f6b9d","1d13f96a076cb0e3590f13209c66ad26aa33792f","1b2084f46e1133624438f87d3c3edba0bfd053fc","8c4eb0cfe00e15b26a41ab366e54acb708e7c1fb","ea92512cb91050fe1cdd55f8ed5c302272303ffc","389acfcf59c39b8a58c0c76afcd159adf0cb62ef","b9015d4f1e591eba7ea21c3566c919f80f7c2afe","9a482b9064eed10ef54d874d08b8a05246b42c9b","14a33be93ed24c5e947556f6b382135abe69fb11","97f1d08c306040401112ff0564f37e6c6a312522"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning a Hierarchical Embedding Model for Personalized Product Search","journalPages":"645-654","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://929153a2-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/qingyaoai/research/SIGIR17_ProductSearch.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crZLvocI2GouvXyPZ55TNtocmnJj3pWX27KDqjQJyAn6JLfyElAUhPi246LPBNohkDwwvfPLk5fxoMvpHSCcUUBIUpBvQv8xRsTsZzBToN4O3HSItDqg8J-79kZVWGE39oOKTm8QQOEomQrhUv4bgBZPVnXN9xshTdyHI7_XitI6jGts5FEPLd__qvh0eoO4fZ0agqz66dnQ34W_uiAO-n1b9rfMMdSVPFH_PYpnZ0UsIPLIks%3D&attredirects=0&d=1","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080813","https://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1260"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Bag-of-words model","Benchmark (computing)","Deep learning","Entity","Extensibility","Generative model","Online shopping","Personalization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","4d4d53a82d105f6d1b5c4a12778dd5667641c387","7a7d290d2feda000027831cbba76b7e38bf18c90","003055c1e7108975f88042f20321add41a7bdee5","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","6ff38efe7537b1f64c9c12c4781fc6f71a7b10ee","2d7f7c9dd68e86ef977a0294a35abb63d9c7bceb","d8b3bafeed46a7b5105a17a6507536c524ed8dcf","36cb4ed29f9f0b6ea37343b3d98154293a374ec2","2bb2ba7c96d40e269fc6a2d5384c739ff9fa16eb","f9dd22e0a3be85c2e721b3a0c4a735268bff0932","2b8859eb4774d2597cd68d5615f2fbaf408a1e6c","9eb67ca57fecc691853636507e2b852de3f56fac","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","22ae02d81c21cb90b0de071550cfb99e6a623e62","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","362d4eec03067fff5a05dd1a450ac7f5d20fbf2f","cca93fbe0534b8eb7bfe1602196aba78ad1bc184","73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","e912e59930acd9f63c9e0c0613620f28468eca0e","1944fda0d2aad86fdfac5f3c0d5c3b4055fa1336","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","0dc505b3d140d9349a2f4dd87cebfa97687f0c08","4ae093d626e17670ede21200f9cf1790e8c23dc8","8b40b159c2316dbea297a301a9c561b1d9873c4a","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","0ece9e2827d0af7f47bef2e14e3d8986556e1bad","17ce7734904a6162caa24e13a9454c1239924744","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e"],"id":"24d31924b294ee9e6c41425b43cb382c535a486d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24d31924b294ee9e6c41425b43cb382c535a486d","authors":[{"name":"Qingyao Ai","ids":["35531065"]},{"name":"Yongfeng Zhang","ids":["1739818"]},{"name":"Keping Bi","ids":["2112104"]},{"name":"Xu Chen","ids":["48282714"]},{"name":"W.

One of the tasks that we address in this paper is to reveal previously unknown effects of drugs on laboratory test results. We propose a method that leverages drug information to find a meaningful list of drugs that have an effect on the laboratory result. We formulate the problem as a convex non smooth function and develop a proximal gradient method to optimize it. The model has been evaluated on two important use cases: lowering low-density lipoproteins and glycated hemoglobin test results. The experimental results provide evidence that the proposed method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art method, rediscover drugs that are known to lower the levels of laboratory test results, and most importantly, discover additional potential drugs that may also lower these levels.","inCitations":["1f468d020bab1a717583ce5ee6ea6cabd3a788dc"],"pmid":"","title":"Exploiting Electronic Health Records to Mine Drug Effects on Laboratory Test Results","journalPages":"1837-1846","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132986","https://astro.temple.edu/~tua87106/cikm17.pdf"],"entities":["Data mining","Proximal gradient method","Proximal gradient methods for learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["074f3e9f973e6127dfe2eb74a51c15594ce15e25","0a34862e37fee68ce275303ac0ed83606af5f1a6","c665f4a9b2ca7beb4ad4a7221e8830ea38b8d769","2d9bb28841d2d5d83efdd1eae87809fe6375fec3","0c2aea1b3b7ccd49f7f7b37416e3cb089554593f","1891576e0fe8521d731bc29b8992838fde43ac0a","3e83ccf41cee2a9d2a4078747f4c5ae03900592c","67c07be3444333aa03098fcc6344ffc82346a41c","2280be7364e8d2b257f5f1476a332e3df1221011","febea3041642cbc787af643858c7254daf9751b0","7ade8e646003c89dd7e81e61cf6ff836721d67ec","75d4215306e82bb2e286dbd472bc78ffd2c8251b","e7a75a379a515197e058102d985cd80f4f047c04","0167272b957bd16b98033f20475b6205f0ac72c5","228dbcb7c998ace5b7732af307642ab48c586176","93501e13ab66610730b5870a21307d2d7187ecf0","9e4291de6cdce8e6f247effa308d72e2ec3f6122","2050bf40b23499b89cbf3b66cc35d44e30ec17bc","546d294b0b85ad5dc3d389433d0e329ad298244f","6bfd537fd4d273da8be818f3df42b7d32f9dd322","4aa00fec49069c8e3e4814b99be1d99d654c84bb","1b65af0b2847cf6edb1461eda659f08be27bc76d","9f6a3844158c36ab9f8cd9be4429da52ec404573","b403a69ea46a59e338def7f6584e1edf4891788d","9ddbc139e26f402f2917fd270e4f478352a80f4c","8696d5776f306b3f9bbe2f0fc5972108ac134a29","d9204c46eeaa85ab37c4f9ee54235d01764e8bea","06fdc312a24b9887a0f9e55bf14d9c76cfbcb030","72af45375b1a0e29e9b635e4334e9b9ba9d15802","d897b2aafee70e1b52a5f064f8d8c9655a9282a0","303751486582377e7b203083263e1ee8856750a4","0ce8879ea7fc0e96fd0e4e242a46002010f86e18","6e36e2093288a3f0dfa609667ac20e3c4748d3d5","25c84b85b041c5fd0ec3750095553ce37404fec7"],"id":"6c237c3638eefe1eb39212f801cd857bedc004ee","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c237c3638eefe1eb39212f801cd857bedc004ee","authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Ghalwash","ids":["15423080"]},{"name":"Ying Li","ids":["48514816"]},{"name":"Ping Zhang","ids":["40187998"]},{"name":"Jianying Hu","ids":["47756328"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132986"}

For all these mixed types and categories of data there exist even more different analysis approaches, often done in single hand-written solutions. We propose to extend HyPer, a main memory database system to a uniform data agent platform following the one system fits all approach for solving a wide variety of data analysis problems. We achieve this by applying a flexible operator concept to a set of various important data exploration algorithms. With that, HyPer solves analytical questions using clustering, classification, association rule mining and graph mining besides standard HTAP (Hybrid Transaction and Analytical Processing) workloads on the same database state. It enables to approach the full variety and volume of HTAP extended for data exploration (HTAPx), and only needs knowledge of already introduced SQL extensions that are automatically optimized by the database's standard optimizer. In this demo we will focus on the benefits and flexibility we create by using the SQL extensions for several well-known mining workloads. In our interactive webinterface for this project named HyPerInsight we demonstrate how HyPer outperforms the best open source competitor Apache Spark in common use cases in social media, geo-data, recommender systems and several other.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"HyPerInsight: Data Exploration Deep Inside HyPer","journalPages":"2467-2470","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://db.in.tum.de/~schuele/data/p0274-hubig.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3133167","https://db.in.tum.de/~schuele/data/dm_plakat.pdf","http://db.in.tum.de/~passing/publications/dm_in_hyper_demo.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Apache Spark","Association rule learning","Cluster analysis","Existential quantification","FITS","In-memory database","Mathematical optimization","Open-source software","Recommender system","SQL","Social media","Structure mining"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["24281c886cd9339fe2fc5881faf5ed72b731a03e","e75c5d1b7ecd71cd9f1fdc3d07f56290517ef1e5","5288d14f6a3937df5e10109d4e23d79b7ddf080f","335f90a5079fed189abc4417cb0650d45dc087fe","0fd2168e9b8fb845a7abbb45518ab25400f90e0d","7ead08393fa2000ea03bb1cc1e3e6e0ac991aac6","13a375a84a6c414b85477a401541d3e28db1e11a","afda6470dd16dc0a865dbb6fc291e5806132379b","934e5266d6d1d3d467ca7fba76f85658c8ff28bf","9ac34c7040d08a27e7dc75cfa46eb0144de3a284"],"id":"e3886d9a989a9830b98a038da34a84bb10f0f6bc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e3886d9a989a9830b98a038da34a84bb10f0f6bc","authors":[{"name":"Nina Hubig","ids":["1999324"]},{"name":"Linnea Passing","ids":["2389427"]},{"name":"Maximilian E.

Users expect these systems to be fast and provide relevant results to their query and context. With millions of documents to choose from, these systems utilize a multi-pass scoring function to narrow the results and provide the most relevant ones to users. Candidate selection is required to sift through all the documents in the index and select a relevant few to be ranked by subsequent scoring functions. It becomes crucial to narrow down the document set while maintaining relevant ones in resulting set. In this tutorial we survey various candidate selection techniques and deep dive into case studies on a large scale social media platform. In the later half we provide hands-on tutorial where we explore building these candidate selection models on a real world dataset and see how to balance the tradeoff between relevance and latency.","inCitations":["184fb9222ae22d0e0d8ebcfb4ac5043bb39208ef"],"pmid":"","title":"Candidate Selection for Large Scale Personalized Search and Recommender Systems","journalPages":"1391-1393","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3082066"],"entities":["Hands-on computing","Multimedia framework","Personalized search","Recommender system","Relevance","Scoring functions for docking","Social media","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6f96c0890e3caf0a4a5d63215a2ef820aebe641c","aec38cdf52cb3d764d1b2b9b5662ef9097f0a96f","5d06b0b24f42fa7f48b01267458baf5e6e7e9fc0","005c2e03221e16fa7d4a77178aa5b22556b20f26","248709e9bed2c4d2024843eeab16338489ed8c6e","9ac34c7040d08a27e7dc75cfa46eb0144de3a284","89d27fc4c5bf15762d001a39f0a74f84c89d3681","c47a21b58cc4a087cd21182fe040de4d9c8e1ab2","760948698540118031e590fbc884fcea209f9104"],"id":"8f161d643808996e34823c89f6f97e4ebc255f22","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f161d643808996e34823c89f6f97e4ebc255f22","authors":[{"name":"Dhruv Arya","ids":["13938287"]},{"name":"Ganesh Venkataraman","ids":["48925671"]},{"name":"Aman Grover","ids":["22237223"]},{"name":"Krishnaram Kenthapadi","ids":["1769861"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3082066"}

Our approach is based on different factors of bias, with the most important ones being language style, editors, and citations. In this paper we present the approach, methodology and a first analysis.","inCitations":["8075ebf7e65960c6de2e43f02a68272598bfd891"],"pmid":"","title":"Bias in Wikipedia","journalPages":"717-721","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c5c5/f3a4f177af2de8ec61039ebc6e43bb377041.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p717.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3053375"],"entities":["Point of View (computer hardware company)","Sensor","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0733daea978db628062ad49663c69b7b2ae75da0","a8c8eac45f10b89d57247d0ad86629ee9d37230f","22fbef34c4325d0fb6fab76a3f7b6993965b3cf1","23775ed72f35e3b8d2585597b217c306a7996350","2b3d70e3c9ccb360029ecda27319b7ccd1f76600","5abed4d6afd78c66480c999be8285f3debbb3c27","2011feb353fed560b0643dc9db6528317c643957","7e15c4e193b965d31ac1d6d416e337526a2a0553","28f4a410432d1256ad5ef0ad4ea078b350787335","aaeebc9823e3ccb8ffab706e2c3a43f66aa21c90","5fdf20ecb20428020063171ff72b74c9ac13bac6","58edd95b593fe5237e0f0bda2f4d09f94b3f3353","aa6e906a7e58b93acce26bc7864564b9fd0c134b","6cbf0f7aac5486d139b3ecbf452b3702e381a857","2a880386cfbba9b56c4d3710adeb61bebfb65643","526acf565190d843758b89d37acf281639cb90e2","5279d14b75347938971ba0886250cead773bcc9d","55a2aff705c3d9ebf2428012d009a072149a1976","0372848db1dbde7478c81b165e0bc6f0b6378b92","3b46d2a5ac4d26ce7f62c724663b6ee282471764","05e10638aab94ca0d46ddde8083ff69859a0401e","f3dbb0fef826882199fcf641ff10ef9f003a5571","4978a99c5fac5639f2473701198239c09f365727","59eeea8be60e99977b0101336d0ead0c0d8e4061","6fb6ef1caf13f840de39a9a17117f21360da748e"],"id":"c5c5f3a4f177af2de8ec61039ebc6e43bb377041","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c5c5f3a4f177af2de8ec61039ebc6e43bb377041","authors":[{"name":"Christoph Hube","ids":["8798204"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3053375"}

Concurrently with their growing importance in public communication, social media platforms may foster echo chambers and filter bubbles: homophily and content personalization lead users to be increasingly exposed to conforming opinions. There is therefore a need for unbiased systems able to identify and provide access to varied viewpoints. To address this task, we propose in this paper a novel unsupervised topic model, the Social Network Viewpoint Discovery Model (SNVDM). Given a specific issue (e.g., U.S. policy) as well as the text and social interactions from the users discussing this issue on a social networking site, SNVDM jointly identifies the issue's topics, the users' viewpoints, and the discourse pertaining to the different topics and viewpoints. In order to overcome the potential sparsity of the social network (i.e., some users interact with only a few other users), we propose an extension to SNVDM based on the Generalized Pólya Urn sampling scheme (SNVDM-GPU) to leverage \"acquaintances of acquaintances\" relationships. We benchmark the different proposed models against three baselines, namely TAM, SN-LDA, and VODUM, on a viewpoint clustering task using two real-world datasets. We thereby provide evidence that our model SNVDM and its extension SNVDM-GPU significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines, and we show that utilizing social interactions greatly improves viewpoint clustering performance.","inCitations":["c4c7f8040dfcc3c03d677ad69a6250bc8d18a657","47d336cd958409738de9644b0971c0c242aeae36","07f95199b2769b2b3f94bdf4ca1b0959109cfcfb","531d44a78064ae9209d694f390286427119a2b51"],"pmid":"","title":"Users Are Known by the Company They Keep: Topic Models for Viewpoint Discovery in Social Networks","journalPages":"87-96","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://www.irit.fr/publis/IRIS/2017_CIKM_TCBPS.pdf","https://www.irit.fr/publis/IRIS/2017_CIKM_TCBPS_slides.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3132897"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Blog","Cluster analysis","Graphics processing unit","IBM Tivoli Access Manager","Interaction","Local-density approximation","Personalization","Pólya enumeration theorem","Sampling (signal processing)","Social network","Sparse matrix","Topic model","Viewpoint"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b07fdf8db57faafaeea5d7d502cab419dfcfa29a","e580ff68891e9d679a2070a282257dc6196bb7cf","502e30c0d3c6fc7686175d756326474e0e1bd371","0a80c7faa7b2c69a2a667054d433ec91617c502d","4b5c4853542d81f98fdfb821a92bad65c6f8bb5d","f26f91e3e722fc59e6f718876c4f9bd1f77f8b14","0c158a3fcccc3b330f401658e516ac804878c2c2","b3625e35fe7de551d628dd4b3875d2ba847f1097","319764d09e38c9bb3508ca57fe8173ba46e271b3","c8665198592b52ba122e5cf84032a9bc1c61eade","80c437ee5544da7461f16249373bd8823eb09375","8dcc45d6858eea6db2a1b1671d24d44e69cd3f0d","9cc098409b7197748f65c9785d5978b5818211e1","81a809b9b5ac940778fe2c7c9fe6df262fec927a","b6f7a7a743fd0415d9da422ee94afb9709f6f57e","0ec57ff75062a6e557998079578587efc869e105","641ed032fc5b69eb14cdd462410ebe05f9dcbfc7","28d4c4612a33f3320b458b31b74330eef27c33c0","8f998c3387e81b4d7d597212757a1beb5194b168","a31b7e6771a67e643934066017b065cc7eb88e2a","2020d23b1155398f77beb3169275f39646d17158","c4795befdb71728e94651a575ec72ce2e91744b2","62f991612959e6fff29128b1d1a54596f6504029","0a167b5f3ccc2ca5332be49f23b0969a993cdbae","9ece17d2915f65c66c03fa28820447199addec45"],"id":"b3b8ac81208bdf811ac2b53c495eeb0041ad89bc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3b8ac81208bdf811ac2b53c495eeb0041ad89bc","authors":[{"name":"Thibaut Thonet","ids":["2955690"]},{"name":"Guillaume Cabanac","ids":["1805055"]},{"name":"Mohand Boughanem","ids":["1731323"]},{"name":"Karen Pinel-Sauvagnat","ids":["1731504"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132897"}

Each behavioral model results in a different metric used to evaluate search performance. In these models and the user behavior assumptions behind them, when a user ends a search session is one of the prime concerns because it is highly related to both benefit and cost estimation. Existing metric design usually adopts some simplified criteria to decide the stopping time point: (1) upper limit for benefit (e.g. RR, AP); (2) upper limit for cost (e.g. Precision@N, DCG@N). However, in many practical search sessions (e.g. exploratory search), the stopping criterion is more complex than the simplified case. Analyzing benefit and cost of actual users' search sessions, we find that the stopping criteria vary with search tasks and are usually combination effects of both benefit and cost factors. Inspired by a popular computer game named Bejeweled, we propose a Bejeweled Player Model (BPM) to simulate users' search interaction processes and evaluate their search performances. In the BPM, a user stops when he/she either has found sufficient useful information or has no more patience to continue. Given this assumption, a new evaluation framework based on upper limits (either fixed or changeable as search proceeds) for both benefit and cost is proposed. We show how to derive a new metric from the framework and demonstrate that it can be adopted to revise traditional metrics like Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG), Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR) and Average Precision (AP). To show effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare it with a number of existing metrics in terms of correlation between user satisfaction and the metrics based on a dataset that collects users' explicit satisfaction feedbacks and assessors' relevance judgements. Experiment results show that the framework is better correlated with user satisfaction feedbacks.","inCitations":["286027de416ee4a015ca5330286083d9f74e56b6","3461025fc75f5ac4f4442ac2e6bed86481d4b1c8"],"pmid":"","title":"Evaluating Web Search with a Bejeweled Player Model","journalPages":"425-434","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/publications/sigir2017Zhang.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080841"],"entities":["Average-case complexity","Beam propagation method","Behavioral modeling","Definite clause grammar","Exploratory search","Feedback","Information retrieval","Latent variable","PC game","Performance","Rapid Refresh","Relevance","Search engine results page","Session (web analytics)","Simulation","Usability testing","Web search engine","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9533cce453af80638bb2914a929fc5c866b2d2b5","ca4a7f9df973718ef415469434f702745d8be289","e95a1ce95b4f0e7b542b70ef80073b9525646717","182f6739d31915434dc39a4f22bc55b391f225d7","bacff358bfd85a4673782c1f56f030283bdaa4e5","2448fdde993e92c2af2006089f42c485080e4231","860d592c5295888ea2a32e3df44714ec6928ebd7","b34d934baf94081af9010a482d7c96d01a60b8f2","40b42731dbb4c8ed6a03fbee44b945b55c00f19a","a0d2d94b212f94804ec42d9c6d3455a1b7455c02","1f0ba28a4123f71ffa045625d29088f8979945da","4ad4b7a754867f5365c6232e0096e26f486d9b4a","7e73991f0aea34871cddf149a94c4d44b280f5e2","5ba7592fe3310106543cffad644addeffc2ad2b3","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","4678d9bd2eb00ed7b1acbab2909feb281b4e470c","13d72ef522b405c18f7d228c5744687609b4c3a4","a0f96a954ccb478440523ef36e67f01de51e6918","7b845d042a614c15b0412258103009f8c9d042a9","264ef4001db964929792479367c2ba26488674b0","1b50c8353d9e4a241a5f4a9c0088eb9c5f593e1f","0e9f79887d29e5fe8455d7cd815f3c44a78ade5e","bd73ec7bac51a332e5833bb1a02bcd3bf7a79474","cec5beaa8147c2d4054847e458e5607367ea2c8b","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","2de7acf5c655c2e5fdab2e373e9b2fc0f9adb469","471cb4c2e5039bdaacb0274fee70c7fe2e93493e","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7","4047d5efd1683bbd3280500c3244149089412024"],"id":"82e3038e54cb47deb2f56134f5dba57ceb94a458","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/82e3038e54cb47deb2f56134f5dba57ceb94a458","authors":[{"name":"Fan Zhang","ids":["47191084"]},{"name":"Yiqun Liu","ids":["1783406"]},{"name":"Xin Li","ids":["40613610"]},{"name":"Min Zhang","ids":["38898636"]},{"name":"Yinghui Xu","ids":["50125871"]},{"name":"Shaoping Ma","ids":["8093158"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080841"}

Often followed strategies, such as recommending popular items are inadequate for this vertical because of two reasons. Firstly, users have their own personal preference over items, referred to as personal styles, which lead to the long-tail phenomenon. Secondly, each user displays multiple personas, each persona has a preference over items which could be dictated by a particular occasion, e.g. dressing for a party would be different from dressing to go to office. Recommendation in this vertical is crucially dependent on discovering styles for each of the multiple personas. There is no literature which addresses this problem.\n We posit a generative model which describes each user by a Simplex Over PERsona, SOPER, where a persona is described as the individuals preferences over prevailing styles modelled as topics over items. The choice of simplex and the long-tail nature necessitates the use of stick-breaking process. The main technical contribution is an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling based algorithm for solving the attendant inference problem.\n Trained on large-scale interaction logs spanning more than half-a-million sessions collected from an e-commerce portal, SOPER outperforms previous baselines such as [9] by a large margin of 35% in identifying persona. Consequently it outperforms several competitive baselines comprehensively on the task of recommending from a catalogue of roughly 150 thousand lifestyle articles, by improving the recommendation quality as measured by AUC by a staggering 12.23%, in addition to aiding the interpretability of uncovered personal and fashionable styles thus advancing our precise understanding of the underlying phenomena.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"SOPER: Discovering the Influence of Fashion and the Many Faces of User from Session Logs using Stick Breaking Process","journalPages":"1609-1618","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://nmrinl.github.io/cikm17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133007"],"entities":["Algorithm","Competitive learning","E-commerce","File spanning","Generative model","Gibbs sampling","Goto","Long tail","Machine learning","Persona (user experience)","Sampling (signal processing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["45eb843f82c166c7ed1d5c7a94b4f85d441c92e6","22bf66441dd0fb73e4d8563ddd56c962bfd38735","6a94f16627379a7163f39a5b909c41b5167d3889","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","8c5442756d8e7110b3cfec0f366f502d82bfe835","9b7a6c96daf95289fac40c8fd76bb13a7a89bec0","10b2bbbe320b9e4523cf94835e2cb8878541d9fd","b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d","4f0f9085460fd383c9cab2b3f63f962303cd7b01","84dcd5357f0757211a9f3031365d258ebbcd9e60","763caad351b26a0c18cc2a363e67c738ad4071fc","6c0a7b47f223b60e45e7f4cb55412b23edb4e43f","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","5170e44c954179768fce6c7d8b1d5f635dc1d9ba","24dcd4bbfa790ddb96631a8877b373abb388f41d","45db16309fbf7e9fc8907047e7e1a9933c4e1b85"],"id":"d0714578256f548edd8390f4719a210aa8193143","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d0714578256f548edd8390f4719a210aa8193143","authors":[{"name":"Lucky Dhakad","ids":["28115301"]},{"name":"Mrinal Kanti Das","ids":["12417163"]},{"name":"Chiranjib Bhattacharyya","ids":["4084728"]},{"name":"Samik Datta","ids":["1945860"]},{"name":"Mihir Kale","ids":["26688118"]},{"name":"Vivek Mehta","ids":["47550505"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133007"}

As a cultural anthropologist, I approach this study with qualitative historical and ethnographic methodologies, positioning the community of researchers that have been involved in the design and implementation of Semantic Web protocols and technologies as my primary field site. Two concepts from Science and Technology Studies are introduced - thought styles and design logics. The paper demonstrates how diverse thinking about how to approach knowledge representation on the Web is rooted in debates that emerged in artificial intelligence in the 1970s and 1980s. It then goes on to discuss how the diverse approaches to Web semantics that emerged from these legacies have cultural and political implications. The paper concludes with a call for further research that positions Web architectures as objects of social and cultural study.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Turn for the Scruffy: An Ethnographic Study of Semantic Web Architecture","journalPages":"359-367","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091505"],"entities":["Artificial intelligence","Inferential theory of learning","Information architecture","Interaction","Knowledge representation and reasoning","Microformat","Scalability","Schema.org","Semantic Web","Web Ontology Language","Web application","Web science","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a48419e179b4958f0c175cfe6077e4061b743419","31a20e64616684c6c88eed290f1af9a510e8db97","10363c274374f0eb9a44564368deedc06b700548","825419d10eed006797bf3c04124c662269e7990e","5019cbf4f9dc52743f0038b4918b63d50873c2e6","9d49388512688e55ea1a882a210552653e8afd61","55c9ac390fee7d6b7df6096dcdb2c0ba09c93c6e","69863837810a8a1aec8431b5179fd9e57c86a4bc","033ecd544c4e71b14a7d3ee0611a300a20b91232","752c3082598605f34b43dd9df42c3543283d1dbd","afa3270a406f0bd100a671af0321c52575719fb6","512d51da2f127da5dfe2b5741f4c93546614acf4","40dc4e40eb4c36b825f5c8dd73e7c14b5bcd30c0","aaa4bb26cbc56a8ee207bf5b0709336ea8758fbe","b732860b9a7f6b8b1d8b9c045ca30edd46eb044b","821e0eabe9a4ca916399d3f6c00e1f15d649017d","453afc6e82b08d15aaa2f2208d0c41eb03940800","9e9c9e96cb16727fc6cd938ab1035ce08b1c8368","91d9e683b1bfba89abe853038363ddfffe4d1671","8a109cdcb896a6c29773b2bc8fa17838af97517f","2e91086740f228934e05c3de97f01bc58368d313","8bda61d86d93b9e887fdd78fa630cc5f4b6223e1","06a7f44c1a75cd00e770af105967c955327af23b","2aa3668a5b01e1e0986f9352c4bfbd80c078326a","57820e6f974d198bf4bbdf26ae7e1063bac190c3","46d615ef27229e99493b5ea470d26816987afbf1","b37f31ebcb40a777b3ea678fd18480a745bcf57e","011b9672e45842b219c3a570e2212e6624680f49","3d6df17e2542a1dfaf4ade2f29a6ed6c59219f3c"],"id":"ef164d41bdc28839739e2aa83ab69062ffbc2729","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ef164d41bdc28839739e2aa83ab69062ffbc2729","authors":[{"name":"Lindsay Poirier","ids":["47383975"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091505"}

However, in recent times, there is an increasing trend towards false claims in social media, other web-sources, and even in news. Thus, factchecking websites have become increasingly popular to identify such misinformation based on manual analysis. Recent research proposed methods to assess the credibility of claims automatically. However, there are major limitations: most works assume claims to be in a structured form, and a few deal with textual claims but require that sources of evidence or counter-evidence are easily retrieved from the web. None of these works can cope with newly emerging claims, and no prior method can give user-interpretable explanations for its verdict on the claim\u2019s credibility. This paper overcomes these limitations by automatically assessing the credibility of emerging claims, with sparse presence in web-sources, and generating suitable explanations from judiciously selected sources. To this end, we retrieve diverse articles about the claim, and model the mutual interaction between: the stance (i.e., support or refute) of the sources, the language style of the articles, the reliability of the sources, and the claim\u2019s temporal footprint on the web. Extensive experiments demonstrate the viability of our method and its superiority over prior works. We show that our methods work well for early detection of emerging claims, as well as for claims with limited presence on the web and social media.","inCitations":["6d0c0649d51f0245cef1de9d5f27012a1a27d958","1e380f2d4920aab98c1a5bf4edcd440be0dc8ebc","1742c355b5b17f5e147661bbcafcd204f253cf0e","e60f58a4ea68d8f961b5d110329653b398fe5ec2","d07c13de730f0879bf1b42614758c6f2ba7752aa","7eec77b7f8604c2414847b1ced34261579f07c01","a167bfd52d17baca47f6431cb6621cb93ae93e21","40cfc568a2caa261f2896d09db636053c2d118eb","b515631d3050c4b1822147ea2125c5629aec5361","d94228909fadcbb4110c1de574544221f04455ae","7f80ec2656666fc6f7a136aa14dc790798032b30","71c398fb1a524a71511d31fb6605c221ef416729","0a94492593d8124e218f100877e80e3d68c06c1d","700c764203c95438083a0c2e0fd5564d207609a5","47205182a1af0914c9b4c507a93793f746ca34a7","54666443068af3e338ca62e85aa30fb4f1a1c0a5","8087fc06738535431cf637a9078ca461083cff93","29a1406a840e43bb5e8a47191be0b6cdc26b7a31","3c527cd9e2c9602de5276c5890326bdeadb34890","0d9f234a2730cd0702f31d6568cff5d846d2450d","8ed928ee22f6a6f6adb539b8221b46a51cf079bc","f8ba55b623d385f641231bbd8c74beee2779703e","eff57ffb739564a8c2b8996908a481c921d90f29","fb3c6429cb3b52d690d7227636da4dff65d8d596","88f888f0de276302e1140624dd01f89a4b48b76a","3bc2f190fe9e7cae2a53bb5a78d116bdbd415934"],"pmid":"","title":"Where the Truth Lies: Explaining the Credibility of Emerging Claims on the Web and Social Media","journalPages":"1003-1012","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5876/e9af5d2fbb156a17aec4d548b395d67b3a38.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3055133","http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kpopat/publications/slides/WWW2017_Popat_slides.pdf","http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~jstroetge/papers/2017-WWW-PopatEtAl-WhereTheTruthLies.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1003.pdf","http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~smukherjee/www17-popat.pdf"],"entities":["Digital footprint","Experiment","Social media","Sparse matrix","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5489730ce63f4eb65e9d7d3f6af172decebadee2","cd48760a142830b796b8a85a158cd469f3e5feb0","a846ddb05a397d1a2d8e717d23c0fd166604b350","3c95247788654b7b60deca996bd749413d21e781","0194a83bd5ab0ba5e334b65a00171f2dd418ecfe","139f4aad228c43e095808b7b24eeb634c9da58f0","1c2e8d2d63312c18944c9477797e65a0975361da","e0742ab892e5890a4c99f5425727ab53a3cb370e","8cc114ff0b9266bc7166543acd77de22865c89c9","4607f09a348c87f95aedd7711b24d8bf614fe58c","1b763ec4c21c799eef00ca26f6afc6c01b45a82c","579e1e9217cfed6d563cedf8f8fdcd1604fc0917","4f8eea99ad4bc9ee26c360ce3123f6eaf2989faa","28ef385643cfa7728227029b62f712459ede5280","113d893885b9416ecb95a18647f3719bba3b8d4f","55a5cf1040830d52930b5205940f1a3ce8e87f2b","6edb419538db1116ecb2be9ed005e469a3c029f3","44b8c8dd33d06284e267f186a0cf6f6aa16faa9a","96227b819c31e9159963d3e7202acd4f5f85100e","4f84bcbddad1e931b0328be6e0a96ca731c538f8","6c6bf6d6b6f718089cc720ccbb16f7d31f6dad41","0e5ebc2eb31b6c78ee0dee10246efeeaf587f7f4","03a54b9c8267a99632cf85deedd8f69c0b8567d2","57072773d35292802b09591722118fab706c4acf","768b5e0b5be77397e7c7308bdd8f2cb05c6bf019","a3b0b94072c06cd45bffc2e7d61335f695ebe70d","04a5042b55db8f8af4cce4982a191ae9eace1cb2","37c90fcd3016171e9f3ac86f7f88b390fe86ee99","e8ee46df8e2116e425abf0cec9604fbf155d4d39","ca741355f2e5af7807d88101e31d636805b434c2","f94350a59508ce0175e33b3427ff0dd92ccc9abf","96b17f09f3afcc9238c1789208eeb016bc2a84d8","c9cc4712777d2e8d1f385f965b444190a5e4dca1","1eeb12122fcd9e4c68b3e214ca3a002baa721092","ad8266828ca2504cef9e25853727644e73f066e4","af2a807c5e32a35765850c6b6891f471d7bc7aea","5f39e48ea21412da169b847a8a24b6ca61763ae3","5a7e809c725eb00b324813c738836b626566f663","2e29bf4bb6c5ee79f56929c5e752b238548dda60","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","a12cd3d9ae5530a90302a6e4af477e6e24fa0f95","1a0f8261d8384bfefbf2d561d446c3a687a5febe"],"id":"916f0019107a45b59aa568f61a3f52d4ae017033","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/916f0019107a45b59aa568f61a3f52d4ae017033","authors":[{"name":"Kashyap Popat","ids":["34910890"]},{"name":"Subhabrata Mukherjee","ids":["1777140"]},{"name":"Jannik Strötgen","ids":["2013656"]},{"name":"Gerhard Weikum","ids":["1751591"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3055133"}

Scholars have thoroughly analysed samplingbased topic modelling approaches for various text corpora including social media; however, another LDA topic modelling implementation\u2014 Variational Bayesian (VB)\u2014has not been well studied, despite its known e ciency and its adaptability to the volume and dynamics of social media data. In this paper, we examine the performance of the VB-based topic modelling approach for producing coherent topics, and further, we extend the VB approach by proposing a novel time-sensitive Variational Bayesian implementation, denoted as TVB. Our newly proposed TVB approach incorporates time so as to increase the quality of the generated topics. Using a Twitter dataset covering 8 events, our empirical results show that the coherence of the topics in our TVB model is improved by the integration of time. In particular, through a user study, we find that our TVB approach generates less mixed topics than state-of-the-art topic modelling approaches. Moreover, our proposed TVB approach can more accurately estimate topical trends, making it particularly suitable to assist end-users in tracking emerging topics on social media.","inCitations":["8523747818bbf256eaec4e6040e0086271827428","24bcd4c2fc80ab4faaa464ef1b9a2fcf4491e08f","b9e897ab356d745e89a6ec0d60a390e62c5282ba","5d43e4b9c09658404412776b67d6bb288bb71137"],"pmid":"","title":"Exploring Time-Sensitive Variational Bayesian Inference LDA for Social Media Data","journalPages":"252-265","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://anjiefang.github.io/papers/fang2017timevb.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_20","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/135028/7/135028.pdf"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Coherence (physics)","Ground truth","Hashtag","Social media","Text corpus","Topic model","Usability testing","Variational principle"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["920871663e6016e59cac6396311355e723dd499f","4450d6014da2e29429b3234b7540d03e751491bd","2cf379819632deb93b2cd9250da25bf21fa25171","11259931b73feac48633a4976825022e08dc4c15","85bcf9fd7d3a8425e16ab7c474b8f6e753e97452","b3625e35fe7de551d628dd4b3875d2ba847f1097","2d4a80489a86528b3567c3ad1524534a8cccbba0","422a5cce1b7d6c46628d27d27aa4bc0fd6f219c4","7f8abf25ca24b48450b4e535f41e2b8a87df73f5","c964ced85cbbd7dee82107d649afa8b1ed4f2cd0","2d05e3aaea5cfda209294439cfcff85736938eb2","c4cf9211ede0dd617add15a0acae8e1be1fc11e8","1b255cda9c92a5fbaba319aeb4b4ec532693c2a4","157aef34d39c85d6576028f29df1ea4c6480a979","26c23e4af1b6a430abc94e5bf27199d10a0d2cde","215aa495b4c860a1e6d87f2c36f34da464376cc4","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","04c14abbe8d416693a6e6400e166c6fa6a493be5","687e2981d007ec267430fa4346841f0d443d0fb2","42fddb742959e80cefe3932475a3c2cad97cba8d","239243dfa44e14b4fca15675d25cb655fb91a7b7","3531e0eb9ec8a6ac786146c71ead7f8d624fd2ca","36c35d48b8f391a1b5200f6227fb5b123a245e4c"],"id":"1d94b9bec8319c3b15e1a1868175506b9a2104fa","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1d94b9bec8319c3b15e1a1868175506b9a2104fa","authors":[{"name":"Anjie Fang","ids":["31855550"]},{"name":"Craig MacDonald","ids":["2691614"]},{"name":"Iadh Ounis","ids":["1698205"]},{"name":"Philip Habel","ids":["1740582"]},{"name":"Xiao Yang","ids":["50820358"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_20"}

Our real-world system has distinct requirements in contrast to previous studies on topic detection and tracking (TDT) and event timeline or graph generation, in that we 1) need to accurately and quickly extract distinguishable events from massive streams of long text documents that cover diverse topics and contain highly redundant information, and 2) must develop the structures of event stories in an online manner, without repeatedly restructuring previously formed stories, in order to guarantee a consistent user viewing experience. In solving these challenges, we propose Story Forest, a set of online schemes that automatically clusters streaming documents into events, while connecting related events in growing trees to tell evolving stories. We conducted extensive evaluation based on 60 GB of real-world Chinese news data, although our ideas are not language-dependent and can easily be extended to other languages, through detailed pilot user experience studies. The results demonstrate the superior capability of Story Forest to accurately identify events and organize news text into a logical structure that is appealing to human readers, compared to multiple existing algorithm frameworks.","inCitations":["0bd17d682a901ad5d25e1aafbb10b7735f168a7b"],"pmid":"","title":"Growing Story Forest Online from Massive Breaking News","journalPages":"777-785","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00189v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00189","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132852","https://sites.ualberta.ca/~lkong/document/CIKM_gsfo.pdf"],"entities":["Cluster analysis","Off topic","Online algorithm","Performance Evaluation","Random forest","Requirement","Time-domain reflectometry","Timeline","Tree (data structure)","User experience","World-system"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1966f5a5b0279bea1298707d6f21258b50f625b4","00c35b117b9aab849ce0a29bcf7692cbd3d2d16f","5681bdb617589eca3aa09d3aa703fe6e449ac15e","368633557ebc054bbfb44046a571fa6fc22de43a","7ce6dfdf44243174bb2577e754dd1310e0907882","930498cecfed4b1fcfaf37c7a1543660f424c4c7","280f9cc6ee7679d02a7b8b58d08173628057f3ea","30d6ee97d15d73d83d8a0dfa5b004cd0cfe7a749","7e7f843b9638ee9dc321fcd348ea2185b9126854","3cc91c223b6c292466261fc139295609edd04ca5","141272ab7aaabc3ecf13b9b99d367c871c3ea526","50483361ce7efd955210903538de693e4246eb21","40d05c08e6b6ffe26566e632326dc4a55513a3bf","17495b9acd116bae8703f5ce004aebd2adb920c5","33a3ad9983a4879f00d6ed38c5891bb67ad461e7","2518baca0772011b8ed2e49faefbdce8d194861c","224e457fde0e97a080ce2385496784ee9d193a02","4dac9af0d1f93683d46d71ca77825d73591463ba","125dc6849f752d6b2919f1b2b1479779533b9518","920bba7bf0f51a008a37c312ed595f2e7431c901","6b204e084cfb74d9ef4bb504aa4133807a198613","452d8739165de53ea33dcf4d09ea098eb6201904","48d277cf8e9b50e53bfcacd535bf834199e976f0","373fd1b2149546ff97ea874ae73f8eef989a11b9","7e43ec7ef23547dbb042768de7b77a714fc351ac","9d4694f2a08da8f34133add0c725269084f898ac"],"id":"1b79289c370f1bc6836e92550948f2f9fe1bff63","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1b79289c370f1bc6836e92550948f2f9fe1bff63","authors":[{"name":"Bang Liu","ids":["50677785"]},{"name":"Di Niu","ids":["1714907"]},{"name":"Kunfeng Lai","ids":["2710113"]},{"name":"Linglong Kong","ids":["2515229"]},{"name":"Yu Xu","ids":["47103320"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132852"}

User generated digital data has made it easier to study such patterns at a global scale. Geo coded Twitter data, in particular, has been shown to be a promising source to analyse large scale human migration. But given the scale of these datasets, a lot of manual effort has to be put into processing and getting actionable insights from this data. In this paper, we explore feasibility of using a new tool, tensor decomposition, to understand trends in global human migration. We model human migration as a three mode tensor, consisting of (origin country, destination country, time of migration) and apply CP decomposition to get meaningful low dimensional factors. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset spanning 5 years and over 100M tweets show that we can extract meaningful migration patterns.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Understanding International Migration using Tensor Factorization","journalPages":"829-830","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/34d6/65b5dfa64408d48c29526b9f618793a51e44.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04996v1.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p829.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054222","http://users.ics.aalto.fi/gionis/migration-tf-poster.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04996"],"entities":["Digital data","Experiment","File spanning","System migration"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ac0a0828c17c040c065a9285264094ba2560497d","091c35d8f42ff9a571ef782f19a3290f1ac62d95","8914a147125c4c6b29ea1071de75295d3d7e503a","1d0f25989452abbbc8feaf00a034ff110fc4b350","15f3f17d5102e93d96a9ebc9668c121c26bb8829"],"id":"34d665b5dfa64408d48c29526b9f618793a51e44","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/34d665b5dfa64408d48c29526b9f618793a51e44","authors":[{"name":"Hieu Nguyen","ids":["37142991"]},{"name":"Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella","ids":["1699369"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054222"}

However, collection size growth continues to outpace advances in efficiency improvements in the learning models which achieve the highest effectiveness. In this paper, we re-examine the importance of tightly integrating feature costs into multi-stage learning-to-rank (LTR) IR systems. We present a novel approach to optimizing cascaded ranking models which can directly leverage a variety of different state-of-the-art LTR rankers such as LambdaMART and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. Using our cascade model, we conclusively show that feature costs and the number of documents being re-ranked in each stage of the cascade can be balanced to maximize both efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, we also demonstrate that our cascade model can easily be deployed on commonly used collections to achieve state-of-the-art effectiveness results while only using a subset of the features required by the full model.","inCitations":["6dcab868c9fbc8d34ffceab1912aa359906930c7","490e32d226b279df6207842fb9ad33b41e6b9151","640925112254d3adbbc4b9382160b32707455d61","8046945020be6b64bb643d1e46be90ca37b75340","df6fab9d2bd32afa603b75e16c59749266f034cc","61a9d991413e112ee95ccdac177ec684738103bd","793820444c36038630cc1b5fa8baa9250d791ad4","26bcfffe1740d3fd8c88e60760e139d1f489af99","3941a1189989e75cea45716cbeb63239c79466fb","3bd105221c102d83d7f66affe8382b3c321efc4b","36d9abbbc4735a9dbd75f57f8f5602bd80d6b0b1","76f449e391ba7fe2428ca563dbd2a1f0cdb54710","3e37b7d4b60334ba083f60d69a73a8c251458d03","1490a399d8e9b7e5eb5059b5556909adc04c6b12","8e7958a75fac8e045864e8192ff383ee909f2837","caa8b954566c9a97db0267b281d8a9843ecfac3d","c87a934d55ca746caefeffa91dc281a4eec98608","f7db53b60694ed860bd5a269606c72aa44e7e0ea","e3511072e3cd03592b1209fde804a194c1640cf1","ec39c1e769eda5001576ba23cbff164808d7fb96"],"pmid":"","title":"Efficient Cost-Aware Cascade Ranking in Multi-Stage Retrieval","journalPages":"445-454","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.culpepper.io/publications/cgbc17-sigir.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080819"],"entities":["Algorithm","Experiment","Floor and ceiling functions","Gradient boosting","Learning to rank","Linear model","Machine learning","Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3","The Australian"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7def1736e4fc660f0fc4c9edac0e5f13ef38ec0e","222ab464a094e82dd21b9774ae67132b58075263","9b276173a2ccef1497d1d270503d2603cd467ad0","20a1afa80ba1ecc069e389b1e36904a7017834a5","05bdc58374f15c2077f3e0ba1152b5a150f91027","aab092de89e16b714352ad31c88d332bd6f815af","0be5ae7e65fea9b56d3eed04ea15bb6bd6ed8a89","55da42dd2b5f0a5e8788124ec7a89a0cd93cac33","3eae360c6ee52950f27f577aedd5f9934a04e137","601de5a3cdf6d99947614ce130a16bde2f11aa03","2bb585c4b9d89b095e9938f7d1d3286e4ac2076f","d2071c1e4a6030dc0005dbfeefdd196a8b293e84","1fc4a3db0443527ac78cba218f2263cd36736783","1b65af0b2847cf6edb1461eda659f08be27bc76d","628dd3515c500ab8683639042dd78ff5c8b42ed5","0d959afca677f60199159ed8f627f344d19e130d","c6fad6b317527162aac8703bc8cb405d5661d806","3c24e943f25db78c17f6a6fdee1c833067fb19d8","d6fba8d74309f90a911bd3b3ca6a95822da52bc6","1a4054cfa2001290b50dfe5e4d6a599fb5b04405","2d0d51ea46e7ded379ac029f69b187a7296f344c","23606ec8a507e74f5a8acadb66f253f1d5047718","582ea307db25c5764e7d2ed82c4846757f4e95d7","0e67bac2937f5f53f310564efa547efd82c0371d","247b97d7f79ae149461d43c661246a783441b3a0","f7a34579f122b240707874b6b76dc71af23ddb0f","27a6fcbd4eb931eb828c437ba66f09d829c4870e","15cb35b14344611a1849a7bf9b872d457ffbe15a","40707bd624bc789d26f13734de41fa41c866a332","266e856baab2282b305789c4e5c6ddf2a9106420","639c5d11e675b0287342399e2094dbe47f9e4b44","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","f96bda0053733a8c7c1333227a6df23e55457c33","7c128d2dcf64d18cbbc3abb395a0583ba3e1fbdb"],"id":"9780e394ac883a8580e941e894cd6aec60fd8508","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9780e394ac883a8580e941e894cd6aec60fd8508","authors":[{"name":"Ruey-Cheng Chen","ids":["1788674"]},{"name":"Luke Gallagher","ids":["35154089"]},{"name":"Roi Blanco","ids":["1864328"]},{"name":"J.

Although there has been much progress on understanding the dynamics and semantics of information cascades, little is known about their structural patterns. In this paper, we explore a large-scale dataset including 432 million information cascades with explicit records of spreading traces. We find that the structural complexity of information cascades is far beyond the previous conjectures. We first propose seven-dimensional metrics, which reflect size and spreading orientation aspects, to quantify the structural characteristics of millions of information cascades. Further, we analyze the correlations of these metrics, finding some brand new structure patterns of information cascades, potentially providing insights into intrinsic mechanisms governing information spreading in nature and new models to forecast as well as to impose good control over information cascades in real applications.","inCitations":["4bae5718d7f7517515c46e525f2986b5557103c8","1150b18c6b3ceb03dcd7005f87c60c65f27a1e27","f6a9f9b477bf42e22019840347bec973eabc261d","9f4573ef05cfd788cc69558fd2e2e759df1c5ef2"],"pmid":"","title":"Quantifying Structural Patterns of Information Cascades","journalPages":"867-868","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e57f/2945be3f85014a4fd2f6a7d67c174640f7e3.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p867.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054214"],"entities":["Information cascade","Social media","Structural complexity (applied mathematics)","Structural pattern","Tracing (software)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4a905ca67ea922040d98aaf644121a5ef4eca937","75b0f1e480ff7bf6526983fa6f9faabf83f1e157","70b992c5d563b6fd198997dae32c2bc7cc78fb80","6431df4d98360373ce9de0843450cddaafd1f9d5","10f86f841152d938dca80fb9ee2069a2a7c1e5e2","01d5e4482c4fa7c8c4dd9a40783efc79fa7640af","49637c41f2dace98c897d2c637e75508fc833d9d"],"id":"e57f2945be3f85014a4fd2f6a7d67c174640f7e3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e57f2945be3f85014a4fd2f6a7d67c174640f7e3","authors":[{"name":"Chengxi Zang","ids":["3440038"]},{"name":"Peng Cui","ids":["48417162"]},{"name":"Chaoming Song","ids":["47641458"]},{"name":"Christos Faloutsos","ids":["1702392"]},{"name":"Wenwu Zhu","ids":["9732730"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054214"}

Bayesian Personalised Ranking (BPR) is a popular pairwise recommendation technique that is used to generate the ranked list of venues of interest to a user, by leveraging the user's implicit feedback such as their check-ins as instances of positive feedback, while randomly sampling other venues as negative instances. To alleviate the sparsity that affects the usefulness of recommendations by BPR for users with few check-ins, various approaches have been proposed in the literature to incorporate additional sources of information such as the social links between users, the textual content of comments, as well as the geographical location of the venues. However, such approaches can only readily leverage one source of additional information for negative sampling. Instead, we propose a novel Personalised Ranking Framework with Multiple sampling Criteria (PRFMC) that leverages both geographical influence and social correlation to enhance the effectiveness of BPR. In particular, we apply a multi-centre Gaussian model and a power-law distribution method, to capture geographical influence and social correlation when sampling negative venues, respectively. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three large-scale datasets from the Yelp, Gowalla and Brightkite LBSNs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of fusing both geographical influence and social correlation in our proposed PRFMC framework and its superiority in comparison to BPR-based and other similar ranking approaches. Indeed, our PRFMC approach attains a 37% improvement in MRR over a recently proposed approach that identifies negative venues only from social links.","inCitations":["f0b8476b2fec3aa4b64dc752c53f1e70b1e18cd1"],"pmid":"","title":"A Personalised Ranking Framework with Multiple Sampling Criteria for Venue Recommendation","journalPages":"1469-1478","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/147491/7/147491.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3132985"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Comment (computer programming)","Computational complexity theory","Experiment","Interaction","Location (geography)","Location-based service","Positive feedback","Randomness","Sampling (signal processing)","Sparse matrix","Venue (sound system)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c421bec956c05b52f11af0de6e46323b0ee6abb9","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","579967a676efe3391d01e5141daf0289d336fd1d","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","b0b95b80690a619471ccd7bca20f5dc82afeccd7","01c1795d00e1ad4a69c5dd3498a38715ca898833","10adbab10ea1063c599ce137d9e5e7f9ca33303f","0dfd1181f8b866a7f0b3e5f63574d7998c778be8","823888e601885ea5339ffb1d1898015e67e2d1f6","ac06fa167a82868636110a678da0cfa4ec57d445","236c4613771834d3cfb43c450305ade107813198","cfcad2cfac38ddad009992c6c93e4942eba31705","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","83160bfdc7bc3a9ad779bde4457b8c5fef9afb5a","7728ecfe5f543a0424f11a048c4fc894c46e9402","63aaf7c8af91a249ce1ad6aac2bc1bec0a5ed76c","d2e7d37dac6b9eb313bd7918f162485111608bea","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","2e635989e232816546ef352edc38881580b04c1e","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8","25ad8ad3d1549888a4609659bd55ad825c5df82e","596e0fe7550663727e304c5de32fc041fc5957a4","6a4c500af497a4846c35480b43927cd5812a8486","1f2de093c64679c99437c3031ede4fd4e32c66cc","68db7962b63bb775575403e650870f53e418f062","db965ce386a1fd724d6e2876ce78eccd9bac9af1","1b233b82ba35c913e0ddcf19b11ec50d013a8149","50054b2cafde87fb71cfbfed966a7ddc0feada50","ee8fe93fa8fe18085e1059f855158f9c26ed9836"],"id":"73e3fda9287eda0c8d4e17b365a18d68f1a65bd0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/73e3fda9287eda0c8d4e17b365a18d68f1a65bd0","authors":[{"name":"Jarana Manotumruksa","ids":["2072304"]},{"name":"Craig MacDonald","ids":["2691614"]},{"name":"Iadh Ounis","ids":["1698205"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132985"}

One of the bottlenecks of probabilistic (temporal) query evaluation is finding efficient ways of grounding the query and inference rules, to generate a factor graph that can be used for approximate query evaluation or to retrieve lineages of queries for exact evaluation. In this work, we propose the PRATiQUE (PRobAbilistic Temporal QUery Evaluation) framework for scalable temporal query evaluation. It harnesses the structure of temporal inference rules for efficient in-database grounding, i.e., it uses partitions to store structurally equivalent rules. Besides,PRATiQUE leverages a state-of-the-art Gibbs sampler to compute marginal probabilities of query answers.

The main goal of this task is to gather how well the participant\u2019s system summarizes important tweets which are relevant to a given topic in 300 words. We have anticipated Text summarization as a clustering problem. Our approach is based on extractive summarization. We have submitted runs in both the levels with different methodologies. We have done query expansion on the topics using Wordnet. In the first level, we have calculated the cosine similarity score between tweets and expanded query. In the second level, we have used language model with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing to calculate relevance score between tweets and expanded query. We have selected tweets above a relevance threshold which are the initial candidate tweets for the summarization of each query. To ensure novelty, Jaccard Similarity is used to create a cluster for each topic.

Since data points within the same cluster may be distributed over different workers which result in several disjoint-sets, merging them incurs large communication costs. In our algorithm, we employ a fast global union approach to union the disjoint-sets to alleviate the communication burden. Experiments over the datasets of different scales demonstrate that PS-DBSCAN outperforms the PDSDBSCAN with 2-10 times speedup on communication efficiency.

These industrial knowledge graphs, due to their large scale and heterogeneity, are often constructed using automated information extraction (IE) toolkits. Owing to the diverse nature of the sources, such extractions are often noisy and contain many semantic inaccuracies. High quality, consistent KGs are critical to effective predictive analytics and decision support. For example, many commercial question answering systems rely heavily on accurate and consistent knowledge graphs generated from life sciences content. These systems typically require an extensible, scalable, and generalizable framework. To address these issues, we build on previous work in ontology and instance data evaluation and propose a method for Large-Scale Knowledge Graph Evaluation. The approach leverages domain ontologies to detect possible inconsistencies. We construct an RDF/RDFS knowledge graph from the output of a state-of-the-art biomedical IE system, ODIN, and demonstrate that it is easy to construct general inconsistency rules for quality control. In this paper we present our results after applying these rules to the KG and then discuss how our approach and implementation can generalize to many large scale industrial knowledge graphs.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Leveraging Semantics for Large-Scale Knowledge Graph Evaluation","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://tw.rpi.edu/media/latest/websci-17-kges.pdf"],"entities":["Biological Science Disciplines","Compliance behavior","Contain (action)","Decision Support Systems, Clinical","Decision support system","Fenchel's duality theorem","Field (computer science)","Graph - visual representation","HL7 2.5 Event type","Information extraction","Kasparov's Gambit","Knowledge Graph","Large","List of toolkits","Ontology (information science)","Ontology engineering","Question answering","RDF Schema","Resource Description Framework","Rule (guideline)","SPARQL","Scalability","TOM","Web Ontology Language"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4e2ebc6379c86944dd521ce94f1782aad5af5298","0b549860adc102548358d0ff1bf51ee4c73e5585","3a7c5cd9c24c755aded8a60dc56713a79a119399","c75bc784291700097fa7a98a364626594c326c89","dd2c0dfa2395dd1e9f47638d6e9289e513c46bec","8ad0e78a9619c50bcb3cae4a589ec9a5d38c437c","90d29b83ef5f3f07dadad6431bd95bb1885631b9","11d62742a3fa19a982d00b062fdbf935b8cfb313","a460ea15d0f33e8fec29adc88f1abeb5991a0c3d","cc88d3ea90449023874e7d5c257a3f3644ace023"],"id":"ac98ceb61d74fabd7b2335e3667119363c63f50f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ac98ceb61d74fabd7b2335e3667119363c63f50f","authors":[{"name":"Sabbir M.

It facilitates many analytical tasks such as link prediction and node clustering and thus has attracted increasing attention. The majority of existing embedding algorithms are designed for unsigned social networks. However, many social media networks have both positive and negative links, for which unsigned algorithms have little utility. Recent findings in signed network analysis suggest that negative links have distinct properties and added value over positive links. This brings about both challenges and opportunities for signed network embedding. In addition, user attributes, which encode properties and interests of users, provide complementary information to network structures and have the potential to improve signed network embedding. Therefore, in this paper, we study the novel problem of signed social network embedding with attributes. We propose a novel framework SNEA, which exploits the network structure and user attributes simultaneously for network representation learning. Experimental results on link prediction and node clustering with real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SNEA.","inCitations":["2a2ec58c7813820592cd487d66ed0b249b846eb0","cb40a5e6d4fc0290452345791bb91040aed76961","60718ff912b372afb048e9d93eba450ed6b6d715","8fd1d13e18c5ef8b57296adab6543cb810c36d81","517d194a47440580156ca1fbad2c5f4a822f2d4a","ead806cd66cdf48dc6fc0f336ca7b6715460cd2b","348666d80123c631f7946daa157602a296795d32","b6f28bdd6466de76a575a1a44932732ad92bd61b","a779031c73a09f6cb9466b56cd64dd7090a91e89","df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","ee0fd8f00b3a2cb2505045214cf730704aa3142c","465dbaf36f20061d3031d829729d4fd0238e9d92","36a95f1a9fbe518427bbf33293488c71161313a9","b0e2ff4fe0dc5c58cd20ba875826e5bcb15d5afb"],"pmid":"","title":"Attributed Signed Network Embedding","journalPages":"137-146","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.public.asu.edu/~swang187/publications/SNEA.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132905"],"entities":["Algorithm","Balance theory","Cluster analysis","Data mining","ENCODE","Emoticon","Experiment","Feature learning","Graph drawing","IBM Notes","Machine learning","Slashdot","Social media","Social network analysis"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8f4cbd83f530817cb88bcad3138d2d1469b16518","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","ecf3e2483d2b987ae9e09465569fa7556e054c0f","10d3c0a7dd22780562bd76ef9bf4278ca3d4b0b5","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","a675cef5b434619a71ec2a30ac63d108f3d98a63","0376e04b6e4dd9a98f7fcbca5947d62771a3f799","c34336d3bfb7a3c22caa7958779f40bb2ab70a3d","9b6f9ee2ef50b3831a13e2bc2c662c349b4cd362","3e8509ad80f880cb76a1d1673abfdd54eb16cc35","03c0b635d8871bd8190b5f8039e113da22e5226f","f0951665942dcb80e795cfbe68b65d0dbda59b17","0b35eeb1ca1fcaa24ef456242bb90320afdd1cd2","5467397a91c82312f589703570d53370e56d27b8","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","2744288f090192987e980274999065ad2d6e45d6","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","02dd0af998c3473d85bdd1f77254ebd71e6158c6","f8b345f1203f153087fe23b56afad286dccb8da4","564ac25436ebe8c5491e27502662ee85b4c0a4de","3eaca435527a765572ed04acd06ba512faac89eb","28dd3e75ac352ae448b68a17b78a7e101f50b8fe","09ef6b06bf395b86d54e490ad61bf8a808f5a262","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","b6f82f6f75fa494cba2d8764c789fdd70361094b","04b3e9e7abe8b2d0be8ddfe080750bc4cb9473d9","2b98beb92b3fd808571d42d3514ff916a0a17366","d63c0a6c83133d858a750d6990a454245010863a","d77c29220d04398427c0a7e17d1deba94faa6e9c","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","5d76202ebe37936b4c3796d9cbbe7be5b60f93d0","d0b7c8828f0fca4dd901674e8fb5bd464a187664","53d83615ac84abbdb048a0254c30ec7b2a7d3d37","484469411d778fe4878150e811ba2d10663b0be8","1ea41b79140d9e6a5956d1302feb4a8c76c29a3d","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","4547356cc1e9315a66c7ddffa9362095c3727837","34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","10e1fb949e10d5fe99d5f1b32bb48d625149bce8","414f22dbd210b850fa43bfd9356217deea1b481d","45d84d67870fc5de3b0747d05d9971d750604e7e","23683f944481ee1fb4973be6afa274bc2a2892f4","452553bc282d6b8b508e2ed878c34b55a93b439f","11bb373a47e7399d4068f0488ecae22a3dd141b8"],"id":"2e8cb18e9dc2cec1ef25d08e4567a2840692a5a0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2e8cb18e9dc2cec1ef25d08e4567a2840692a5a0","authors":[{"name":"Suhang Wang","ids":["2893721"]},{"name":"Charu C.

In particular, we expand the query using knowledge information derived from Probase so that the expanded one could better reflect users\u2019 search intent, which allows for microblog retrieval at a concept-level, rather than termlevel. In the proposed feedback concept model: (i) we mine the concept information implicit in short-texts based on the external knowledge bases; (ii) with the relevant concepts associated with short-texts, a mixture model is generated to estimate a concept language model; (iii) finally, we utilize the concept language model for query expansion. Moreover, we incorporate temporal prior into the proposed query expansion method to satisfy real-time information need. Finally, we test the generalization power of the feedback concept model on the TREC Microblog corpora. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the previous methods for microblog retrieval significantly.","inCitations":["d0e7e77d3e12303dd91612e1c76173b125b34d12","2471ff80b7251cd8ab46e267da63aa3cfb2bdb1d","d6ebe66e82669a68018da7341ec96efdf77d7517","87ff464df5627426e3a0cbde8a70f9ecf88e1199","97347192e6f1853391784d299c2df7edb4f51955","ba3c1c7337606c2fb5efce338d0341c785d49acf","fbc9d89325b38f1d55e9558686d359851617e2e2","0e4ca61becae37554f7532342fbe03483a4a429a"],"pmid":"","title":"Query Expansion Based on a Feedback Concept Model for Microblog Retrieval","journalPages":"559-568","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a694/4f6494bab5616430c721fdcfa6229be78866.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p559.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052710"],"entities":["Algorithm","Feedback","Information needs","Language model","Mixture model","Query expansion","Real-time data","Text corpus"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","0436536e6a961f278eced064058d0b4d68b9fc5e","2e36d49444ecb20d0905482a873c9386ef3ec9f6","82eabe8f36a4d7b8bb6fa293af539ad35c537387","e6043a0fc38d78be56ce39f7de04039e4e0573e9","a2bec0c2a8346d36b9b03c7b0d2c8426ed28ff46","040c31cb7b590d9e5d3517a818f6954869de6a43","158f9e4e385645d2db3949483789cc84ceb41c3c","303eef410700063913f9e6ad349a0830dbccefb8","4fe7c499d1dd1ed34f2d70fbfd835d72366b12e8","2b11dd6e1de2e702860c446cb00d48b2bdae1a08","079af7295a47097ed1e7da00a7f518684a4add89","f5fbee4c06709d7a192aad33c6d29a882074f73f","0e456654dddd2f6eaf45e00e6deff71dcfdfaf22","7f5a84a686b580b7b954907f4e52c0079eb0319e","241ec61dff7f9d82f746705071700883fc841a93","882d1450caab82eadc6591b4d650baf252a85740","1971425c8e95d75dca4fec126504d7fa6179c926","3c9ac1876a69b4e35b5f0690ea817de6ac26295d","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","949b8f32d7d39d5b4bd322e449308e6f682c9cac","cbd92fac853bfb56fc1c3752574dc0831d8bc181","a58faf545f6434402ee383bac5766a1d0cfc3182","5d052103c01843bea0124dd60dd6233d7bb77514","e7082909d755f02c32dec49bbfde9bc4518240ba","0a73487b85e6b603c74525b308e848212f6be199","28259083bce75a859134937a2bba78e6d6df2907","f847fd515d19a708d33dfd9e959cc6bbcec82129","f458d2f0dea9ca03e8e004f4b1d2cf9a6e31fd28","669441a336c4fb82dfd08c5b7e50b49f08bf869b","ab12d9fb59ee2d4ad08329e500a01ac15ce30a53","20282a78d7de824dd5567ae78926687fe0bbb061","214adc2dfdc2160cdf5be54001daf2b2304a03b3","2d753756235ceed17d97c26d3bce946b57010178","551de9b970f9a78bb0c486936a9766e0e55a77ae","a0dbdb290a46f5cdc7084cfdf40f7133014e6f88","3129e79d7c32c2802977fa7d0c9d705cd007a66c"],"id":"a6944f6494bab5616430c721fdcfa6229be78866","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a6944f6494bab5616430c721fdcfa6229be78866","authors":[{"name":"Yashen Wang","ids":["3292396"]},{"name":"Heyan Huang","ids":["4590286"]},{"name":"Chong Feng","ids":["2905313"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052710"}

Specifically, the paper presents a method developed to detect student ties based on temporal proximity of their assignment submissions. The paper reports on findings of a study that made use of the proposed method to investigate the presence of close submitters in two different massive open online courses. The results show that most of the students (i.e., student user accounts) were grouped as couples, though some bigger communities were also detected. The study also compared the population detected by the algorithm with the rest of user accounts and found that close submitters needed a statistically significant lower amount of activity with the platform to achieve a certificate of completion in a MOOC. These results confirm that the detected close submitters were performing some collaboration or even engaged in unethical behaviors, which facilitates their way into a certificate. However, more work is required in the future to specify various strategies adopted by close submitters and possible associations between the user accounts.","inCitations":["ec59c62c9accf68d68936eaea176631457e416d2"],"pmid":"","title":"A Data-driven Method for the Detection of Close Submitters in Online Learning Environments","journalPages":"361-368","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c79a/5da34c9cfaa59ec9a3813357fc4b8d71d96f.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/31306442/close_submitters_method.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p361.pdf","http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/31306442/close_submitters_method.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57696274"],"entities":["Algorithm","Massive open online course","Online machine learning","Public key certificate","Sensor","Temporal logic","User (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ceb5ce098cdada4a205ec2d83fc8dd0368f13836","8a4c5265274a748a01e1d6a4805c3383894593c6","1be51ff93442ae6719db2aa3a222691cfcb14afa","30b5b12979f7b12c758c997509ec82e46abfeea5","f67dad4e1fc000cb8ebb2cb6a8c3f7183d0efe86","34073f4020d43cbb8fd7e074a7b79faa3b8b9b8c","3c6eed001a62729a4a3c385e20593037965ebccf","374744d029c72ff90cb87662628e7bc8b8f644d3","08b7a89aafe1703e3b1d628d6e81b0791cfa867b","4feff4cc6681b9bd10fc6176acd7a7ffce8c7607","3274b0ddab42968cb84b6e60e809ab9687ca2592","6bfcf2205c06be8fa89ebf43679c82dd0ed0bad7","7897d3637846cf56e2a3ad59a12fcf5a1dce974a","4e5d284c08cf92edc7d64567574fa6a7287a3b1f"],"id":"c79a5da34c9cfaa59ec9a3813357fc4b8d71d96f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c79a5da34c9cfaa59ec9a3813357fc4b8d71d96f","authors":[{"name":"José A.

To this end, minimal modules (sub-ontologies that preserve all entailments over a given vocabulary) and excerpts (certain, small number of axioms that best capture the knowledge regarding the vocabulary by allowing for a degree of semantic loss) have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce the notion of subsumption justification as an extension of justification (a minimal set of axioms needed to preserve a logical consequence) to capture the subsumption knowledge between a term and all other terms in the vocabulary. We present algorithms for computing subsumption justifications based on a simulation notion developed for the problem of deciding the logical difference between ontologies. We show how subsumption justifications can be used to obtain minimal modules and to compute best excerpts by additionally employing a partial Max-SAT solver. This yields two state-of-the-art methods for computing all minimal modules and all best excerpts, which we evaluate over large biomedical ontologies.","inCitations":["8a023f19187ba2aa99133aa9dcbe855cd5f93f13","96ef44609c6de71c393b8492ed2d9e72e38bcd0e","4d268218485b48a197b63cd379b95a63d5656f39","4dacd20e76921ede0aec038df39363c34ab3a8ab","39aecb8b28a67285a63246c6ab94bafd7b2091ef"],"pmid":"","title":"Zooming in on Ontologies: Minimal Modules and Best Excerpts","journalPages":"173-189","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fab4/6e7780b5e784cbfc120e3db4a05ef4ef94af.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://videolectures.net/site/normal_dl/tag=1145350/iswc2017_walther_ontologies_01.pdf","https://iswc2017.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/MainProceedings/421.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_11"],"entities":["Algorithm","Boolean satisfiability problem","Maximum satisfiability problem","Ontology (information science)","Simulation","Solver","Subsumption architecture","Vocabulary"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["22283dcb5e5e225f564a69ae5fcab55f2c9f85d5","36ada37bede2f0fd3dbab2f8d4d33df8670ff00b","20253ca8dcf0a2d676617e8a1ad32db0d4f363d0","081a9978c0c170afbf3b7c7c1d63fcaaee6960df","6f1d6468460cf52d4d445f051cfadf6ce2ff728b","800d7b9b895bc9bd466a4cec398a8e2f945646d5","037a3faa61f4ea56c33f2325d9a0daf09c304a06","bf24ffe92c6fa7bcafb95d42a7fffde60d7ca607","23cbaa3cc045a04bcf4e33b3784de86be9c3ce2c","0bb7b7cef87d59609f13dc3ba037a2b8c7e72219","36d42edd0fd7ceb12cdc497dbacb5a3bb2b86a77","8ad66c18a03c26ea2471118da7f3b660859c7086","762a52e4121038f737445d7ba4d4f329e53b2ecc","4c8bcbf9229b670e2f9b799b83467423dba17246","493620eb72def9e2b11e9afc6c90ee99c9e7fc31","446e32088196fa8bd872d03aa39e3654259bdd36","3863bb88525943ed4e37efd7ecc0e80cf7fb7fe3","a22d0465cf8243050f15a37b4f7878d72471e60d","18b28d80c94391646dcbb78c37633f4f9d48a00f","437ec028ed09e06683e1899a2f0c54f11257ae50","9f627e9ffccd9f559054b55178e96b80dfac1cb2","237d4affc54085e2eb39581049bfd13c6d273efc","52d914e23963317a7d32794d555619c00b044112","8f040452305252f80432d4b708c1f2ea5e0724a7","96604fd857595f83024dd42769b54664c330c5c2","438e50e6034517c05ceff6cc0879a0b42e728a73","b9cdeb442ae54468f5347f187873e74ceb3a6134","0fdc6b08b429d3d8cff81bde99d6c83a92754060","884e9e1ee39b5fd6efb716a44f1875d20a9d5033","c81d9dcf3f945bf40b703c41e8927c0c8571c434","054105773a76c72a9a222d12e95f52db4ff436fb"],"id":"7244404e64749997ef56a01442e4664ac60cf198","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7244404e64749997ef56a01442e4664ac60cf198","authors":[{"name":"Jieying Chen","ids":["2492087"]},{"name":"Michel Ludwig","ids":["4024584"]},{"name":"Yue Ma","ids":["15470377"]},{"name":"Dirk Walther","ids":["31653411"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_11"}

We conducted a detailed study of Content Censorship (CC) and Content Edit (CE) in Facebook using a detailed longitudinal dataset consisting of 57 public Facebook pages over 3 weeks covering 145,955 posts and 9,379,200 comments. We detected many CC and CE activities between 28% and 56% of these pages (in both Facebook Posts and Comments). Manual judgements on these post/comment removals and edits show that majority of the content censorship is related to negative reports on events and personal grouses, and content edit is mainly performed to improve content quality and correctness.

We show\u2014 theoretically, via simulation, and through experiments on real user data\u2014that de-identified web browsing histories can be linked to social media profiles using only publicly available data. Our approach is based on a simple observation: each person has a distinctive social network, and thus the set of links appearing in one\u2019s feed is unique. Assuming users visit links in their feed with higher probability than a random user, browsing histories contain tell-tale marks of identity. We formalize this intuition by specifying a model of web browsing behavior and then deriving the maximum likelihood estimate of a user\u2019s social profile. We evaluate this strategy on simulated browsing histories, and show that given a history with 30 links originating from Twitter, we can deduce the corresponding Twitter profile more than 50% of the time. To gauge the real-world e↵ectiveness of this approach, we recruited nearly 400 people to donate their web browsing histories, and we were able to correctly identify more than 70% of them. We further show that several online trackers are embedded on su ciently many websites to carry out this attack with high accuracy. Our theoretical contribution applies to any type of transactional data and is robust to noisy observations, generalizing a wide range of previous de-anonymization attacks. Finally, since our attack attempts to find the correct Twitter profile out of over 300 million candidates, it is\u2014to our knowledge\u2014the largestscale demonstrated de-anonymization to date.

It is an intriguing research question to model the interplay between these different modes in attracting user attention and engagement. But in order to pursue this study of multimodal content, we must also account for context: timing effects, community preferences, and social factors (e.g., which authors are already popular) also affect the amount of feedback and reaction that social-media posts receive. In this work, we separate out the influence of these noncontent factors in several ways. First, we focus on ranking pairs of submissions posted to the same community in quick succession, e.g., within 30 seconds; this framing encourages models to focus on time-agnostic and community-specific content features. Within that setting, we determine the relative performance of author vs. content features. We find that victory usually belongs to \u201ccats and captions,\u201d as visual and textual features together tend to outperform identity-based features. Moreover, our experiments show that when considered in isolation, simple unigram text features and deep neural network visual features yield the highest accuracy individually, and that the combination of the two modalities generally leads to the best accuracies overall.","inCitations":["f1300f87951d299dadb491df2e590597effef9e0","96d186f9425fff3388a5ad0acefe2d9f264dc478","a41ccb5d1835ba05221c10e43a640fcac72fa609","98e6461b4d9eab81d17478cd732368c380d1edac","0bf7bd118a3e281972069c1c8de0cf21f1fb4766","0942fec7c41d8a17e928d39bb5c606543456d8d5","0a3583b7d6a8515a589c07c5595b9806d5b56107","338781e5236d5caf6254509bfa0f240ecf820872","2d9395beede0c0f30ba0906812584b9ba0127db4"],"pmid":"","title":"Cats and Captions vs. Creators and the Clock: Comparing Multimodal Content to Context in Predicting Relative Popularity","journalPages":"927-936","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/86ae/69d1f8d5c3b8c57de6ae69d255971e9fad11.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jhessel/files/2017/WWW_2017.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p927.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01725.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052684","http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01725","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01725v1.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Deep learning","Experiment","Framing (World Wide Web)","Multimodal interaction","N-gram","Social media","Succession"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4c0827bd2bf4652a615b0838f9ec7965b9b4b2ea","ccf60d08bdd989ea3595bbbda132dedd71c47acf","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","10d6b12fa07c7c8d6c8c3f42c7f1c061c131d4c5","5ebc4007f2c83ff9ff70f986b2df58f9dcbafaa5","540a8b3f2a8eb6104db0b37d89f3918cb6324815","03c1e67111befacceaa2d875fc4ed17b5d209c36","6c02fb356a092783c165eb462b537633ae0ebd8d","3c26c74777c0d69efd35bb68cfd04da5585d96de","720989c958555bbbb2d0250ed3a13fc486049f64","fa6cbc948677d29ecce76f1a49cea01a75686619","625ef5356b3e8f7a787a805c23ce4c34640ed596","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","54dd77bd7b904a6a69609c9f3af11b42f654ab5d","127316fbe268c78c519ceb23d41100e86639418a","10c0b220a421a38f19f77d3d368b43d6894559c6","65e56e3da30720e61bde8d16df8e7ead407a0c70","b53ae1e21951da384578de27cbddea3b4b69dc20","a772b2d623e90159021d093333c55dbeeac7bd2c","f7f9b187b1a10fcbdc5f353c424740578d7315e5","21aae3d9e624ebda090f7af1410c4ea10476001d","2f83f6e1afadf0963153974968af6b8342775d82","1c9e1d20055b259669be07106ab1ccf9a1b20c60","984d1f4522443f0ad6571d342c1b3088420fb4ec","1ec41770e9f6213a0a9febf64f02350377f5bbb9","6dd7d080f6918108cb2725c5434f96d35586120a","0036c2a84a0b1a39d008c8dee93b6e763323b7da","14af018e67a16b20a12acb311f4881cc2f257ee9","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","80f632dae7169eafcc4bc6435434f28d73bf1177","5ee3da8b1577de0de75e45ba498095c08bc349ff","c5d7763707d3504f0dec73c39424ec688b8692a3","dfef2eea68e1b952e7e67372b064efdf219eb654","fc78001c0ff41b52484095613db8cbd960eb9c73","128da24de37c5e9def90d9a3e4b4bb355432311c","0184c2d0139763e032da854a779f541257da97fc","8e9bb6efaea466986642e928b690b9023a6f6963","9e8d87dc5d8a6dd832716a3f358c1cdbfa97074c","076ddb6d7b62ed5d4600dae6422184c1bc61e395","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","5161289e88b0d8eaef95ab59962aae789f1b8e1e","919000e100bb98c1a2580693be2a33cd60ad429c","e05a29c04fafc67fd5489d23c441f87365ad2399","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","0592c7442b1b0badb1e37d4d0a37dfc33d6aa29f","0f74ff9c9cd94ee2c874b9e3a979665c1cb4c0ac","555fe855d0f7dc6c0aebe88ffcf5cda3a2bada69","7a3f42d68c4054fd593ec3285c7cd03eb18ed502","311fcda76dc7b7cf50b17c705a2aaaaab5ed6a04","426235930457f07ec20fe603b0437e4af9c50017","3d95a08188bbfa55360bb79fa5e6ad25ba96f89b","270753bb8bca13ee1d809f9726ab8c6e1a8f5d8e","0ad0a1293f80c838c843726eeddf5a97f33f0c89","48886ea4ee14f0151f186207e1b9ad1d947e83ef","30593ad852efa6b0f7b21c0413041f9ae9d06e51","b6bbda4a8cd2a7bdeb88ecd7f8a47e866823e32d","5c6892e062308bc08307b8f29ae0baf8e058d82f","7e45f1bc179da7acd5b0e60565f9756a5e83e1f0","67daaff0f9c56fbc12414f10805de784bb954ba7","12f806ec40bc0d4199fe90867195397b7a41a22a","4eaa5d93df54410312912ab619ea4cdc58c202b7","f28bbee52ccd41da02f12cb2c93301056d51278a","6727d29d0e8328bf6dda361a2f5f9cab0643710e","463eb9c11f1b1821c57de27df4d2bd5360140583","6053788472fc36ecce57e2a72e3d84987765fa81"],"id":"3014142323220643997bffc22142bbf5dbf40d92","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3014142323220643997bffc22142bbf5dbf40d92","authors":[{"name":"Jack Hessel","ids":["2689239"]},{"name":"Lillian Lee","ids":["47929715"]},{"name":"David M.

We discover motifs (repeating behavior), discords (anomalous behavior), joins, bursts and dynamic clusters in activities of Twitter bots, and explain the significance of these temporal patterns in gaining competitive advantage over humans. Our analysis identifies a small set of indicators that separates bots from humans with high precision.

{"doiUrl":"","venue":"SMERP@ECIR","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2017,"paperAbstract":"Social media has quickly established itself as an important means that people, NGOs and governments use to spread information during natural or man-made disasters, mass emergencies and crisis situations. Given this important role, real-time analysis of social media contents to locate, organize and use valuable information for disaster management is crucial. In this paper, we propose self-learning algorithms that, with minimal supervision, construct a simple bag-of-words model of information expressed in the news about various natural disasters. Such a model is human-understandable, human-modifiable and usable in a realtime scenario. Since tweets are a diffferent category of documents than news, we next propose a model transfer algorithm, which essentially refines the model learned from news by analyzing a large unlabeled corpus of tweets. We show empirically that model transfer improves the predictive accuracy of the model. We demonstrate empirically that our model learning algorithm is better than several state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms.","inCitations":["7a5079fbef6f496c6f8178f2c3cbae3f70e802ae","bc9c4f0fb38b241a4d198296811be106964e03d1"],"pmid":"","title":"Weakly Supervised Classification of Tweets for Disaster Management","journalPages":"4-13","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cef9/9463bc9416ddcb96cb4498a559eb193c5bf5.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1832/SMERP_2017_peer_review_paper_1.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Bag-of-words model","Hashtag","On the fly","Online machine learning","Real-time computing","Real-time locating system","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Social media","Software deployment","Supervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","86aa2e49291238362a3d5dd58d8eef1a0ca208ac","0cccfd93d76c09d8bd3fbdefd1f8db9de0c7cedf","28a9b3848abcfd1e5b13bc0abb0c6c33b00a625d","665bb05b43dec97c905c387c267302a27599f324","49b2a1b9606c0ccb95a36895760fc91b8b830266","07f33ce4159c1188ad20b864661731e246512239","c7788fe99735eceff2bcc37401fc02d2825f739a","2abac12c9a4a088475dc6f63bb249ecb539624ec","a84f8b5f6fc5af05564353e2fa5d456e34059aa0","779c0713a86e27fbffe999017837a56cbcae09ed","8db9e3f2384b032278ed9e9113021538ef4b9b94","7119012fc5a3b3b8db98a6c05cb6b29b5f4da7d5","17accbdd4aa3f9fad6af322bc3d7f4d5b648d9cd","797b2bcbedc2b650fff4622b88a3d0d13110c19b"],"id":"cef99463bc9416ddcb96cb4498a559eb193c5bf5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cef99463bc9416ddcb96cb4498a559eb193c5bf5","authors":[{"name":"Girish Keshav Palshikar","ids":["1747097"]},{"name":"Manoj Apte","ids":["2515479"]},{"name":"Deepak Pandita","ids":["11001673"]}],"doi":""}

It is based on recent advancements in the area of word embeddings. WISDM combines learned word vectors together with traditional count-based models for document similarity computation, eventually achieving state-of-the-art performance and precision. The novel method first selects from two text documents those words that carry the most information and forms a word set for each document respectively. Then it relies on an existing word embeddings model to get the vector representations of the selected words. In the final step, it computes the closeness of the two sets of word vector representations, fit into a matrix, using a correlation coefficient. The presented metric was evaluated on three tasks, relevant to the analysis of scientific documents, and three data sets of open access scientific research. The results demonstrate that WISDM achieves significant performance speed-up in comparison to state-of-the-art metrics with a very marginal drop in precision.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Word importance-based similarity of documents metric (WISDM): Fast and scalable document similarity metric for analysis of scientific documents","journalPages":"17-23","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3127526.3127530"],"entities":["Centrality","Coefficient","Computation","Marginal model","Scalability","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"442a7c219bb7ac57aec81ec5c2a3962068986bf0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/442a7c219bb7ac57aec81ec5c2a3962068986bf0","authors":[{"name":"Viktor Botev","ids":["8913968"]},{"name":"Kaloyan Marinov","ids":["46208236"]},{"name":"Florian Schäfer","ids":["40542351"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3127526.3127530"}

The primary reason behind this is that analytics on such user data form a core component of many online providers' business models. On the other hand, if the profiles reside in the SP's system in an unchanged form, major privacy violations may occur if the infrastructure is compromised, or the SP is acquired by another organization. In this work, we investigate an alternative solution to standard profile removal, where posts of different users are split and merged into synthetic mediator profiles. The goal of our framework is to preserve the SP's data mining utility as far as possible, while minimizing users' privacy risks. We present several mechanisms of assigning user posts to such mediator accounts and show the effectiveness of our framework using data from StackExchange and various health forums.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Privacy of Hidden Profiles: Utility-Preserving Profile Removal in Online Forums","journalPages":"2063-2066","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133140","http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~rsaharo/cikm17poster_seabrsrgw.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Data mining","Deep learning","Experiment","Fragmentation (computing)","Internet privacy","Machine learning","Parallels Desktop for Mac","Stack Exchange","Synergy","Synthetic data","Synthetic intelligence"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["153dc4d5f2fbd233fec32b8e102f9a7128feed53","9136f0feef9bdb9eae14a52f18032086c5668703","2644e55aaccf6705f1fb79391cba92714421ae6d","ea775c61144a28136239f1edfa09b6fedd571db0"],"id":"5ce0a5b6847e86dbd6f8a4a2467f05902fbbb3a5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5ce0a5b6847e86dbd6f8a4a2467f05902fbbb3a5","authors":[{"name":"Sedigheh Eslami","ids":["49702955"]},{"name":"Asia J.

Here, for the first time, we extensively study this novel phenomenon on Twitter and we provide quantitative evidence that a paradigm-shift exists in spambot design. First, we measure current Twitter\u2019s capabilities of detecting the new social spambots. Later, we assess the human performance in discriminating between genuine accounts, social spambots, and traditional spambots. Then, we benchmark several state-of-the-art techniques proposed by the academic literature. Results show that neither Twitter, nor humans, nor cutting-edge applications are currently capable of accurately detecting the new social spambots. Our results call for new approaches capable of turning the tide in the fight against this raising phenomenon. We conclude by reviewing the latest literature on spambots detection and we highlight an emerging common research trend based on the analysis of collective behaviors. Insights derived from both our extensive experimental campaign and survey shed light on the most promising directions of research and lay the foundations for the arms race against the novel social spambots. Finally, to foster research on this novel phenomenon, we make publicly available to the scientific community all the datasets used in this study.","inCitations":["d68056918752b86517b3b288d075fb0c082af6f0","11124d7c9b422e9639c614c6fbc57b11edc3ae42","60aff219dba8f341f03bbbcbc723ee3a15696a32","bb1696f0e161af6a7269c3074634e7360a4cc199","30c360482be33e9722945660cd74e9b095b798a7","65f5f73e074f6d3471a7a495e35bc2510288e5d5","fe0e7d7baaa072d7061950cb8156b111449da937","52335ca1d1f964633953c0dd490005e34cff9716","d1284145ce1f08dbef18dbc0b3f2f2d8248fee87","7a6823d16a1dc680c9bdfe03dc4caccbe2e944b6","24f0e5dea2c8e017a297117579edd83fd86cf695","a26e46d88f0fd6a8e944758dbf40906345bd89c9","2736b2b6a0120ca2c72b2673f1e3028be547ae16","aa34ebe5547656d44abf4e8b988a92f137bc536a","2accd4f1f173f801130994426827f6c4c615b311","69c214d8b981fee50a2b48925425a6fca4882710","9530999127bb5b01fa61309b0af083dc058212b1","e2196b47133c2191d380098744c13ba77133e625","1a02d1675f926661164d1344c627a53e391d1fca","2b8fdd673696a2f7b51b20c8b98ebfb5b4d04aaf","ca3955b7335545848e261259c4c1e95444413a5b","94ace8298f7ce8b1567e566ed46f8e1b8ea9a089","b31ecc8b5ab6d15d3477442758a420664d7cb36a"],"pmid":"","title":"The Paradigm-Shift of Social Spambots: Evidence, Theories, and Tools for the Arms Race","journalPages":"963-972","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/80a3/6751b21ca288b7490f354f89ddc14531c3bf.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03017v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03017","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p963.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3055135"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Coat of arms","Human reliability","Programming paradigm","Sensor","Social media","Spamming","The Fight: Lights Out","Theory"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7157dda72073ff66cc2de6ec5db056a3e8b326d7","3864116203583e54f4edfcf832cbe8ed3ea55629","2639ea083cf5f076e329aa79fdfa4763ea5dd0c7","420c43d4a2a96910e54465ff20fe6d08a5c008e2","1abf6d997bafe17463b5b1a4f36a38d61a9b6d1b","a5ce1a22c2c824f5151a08c4c0a5e42fe5eb7fab","0088523c4bf74b35c2e7471e740d6758ab36f7b9","0bfee412a7d9c4b8107623341695be7e62442d87","1410b30ae1ac289ef8ae8297acb55551be3be075","53f31f82557d66b6de06ed749f426f49a78d5435","136d0daa5d918dfebe8a26a6991053ef372892ea","2a68bcec7bfd792b8bd45825697c07419469adde","0286a1efab096db135715ee99e6ce122174b9f3e","cc88ed7fee917555f13be25c6e6e60380a15ecee","283b0864062319c567d9f77fbdff66b66aa6e293","5a28d75950960f4d6d9d328f30c7f003ecb28f57","b565f642c5133dfc8c7bd3e2403aef1e7d79cf09","424536ddab83337b6fed7ddebb32a3c4db30c8a8","1a58ba303834253955825fc723207e4d92ffe384","4f6487d61ba6c2afa44be0e870599bb292e27638","cb9355d11aabfac2eac54a7a38219a006a7548b7","91ee82cee43520aea3dcbed52f91d2edf679da30","0f5ab445f40c116d24e14062ccfce98ef9aad791","27efd568fe5968b0953ac651d70c9abfc6e1d5e4","37092f9c79cb6220fd6f01882e9e3c1b41d0750e","d6f9478f68af85b48c44efcea6dc97566a6c82b6","3820c34d714e37acea5e17349f3cd12c5dc4e27c","0a645cbb39ac37929a2e6ba55fc248dc4ca967e4","c0c7f7e4cb004a03f09e985166b6fb25aaa0b428","f1622c3010ec0619ac60a12302cbb271fee5dc2a","c6475417db0be64a34cd18e422af6fd0b1785606","0abe9fda6240ba72e2f76afe10d5f6181e144527","1a4717d09ae6251070b71fd7656de78f700358a0","71e5a6c95ff476c303c3adeae0c1a4387485f733","371db75f3f668317af075767b0630c6c93288212","1dd5355e62b9fc37a355e135d5909ed28128d653","3897a39e4eedf8bfe12b33276b49d4cb79f3f02f","57f2c079dfb005a11be1238e055890943d4db690","78d3b266e1dd981dd7c5eef6371393ea0d0983b2","3f7060aa21f5087cb0a83b4f6576fad5b2bf9055","770b84001e48c829cc8c120acab71fc4e3ee9e0c","12de03e2691c11d29a82f1c3fc7e97121c07cb5b","aac8ca93d72544ad5e94550b01e2a4f477d4c1ff"],"id":"027620c83ce89c951c8d547274003c6a643307fb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/027620c83ce89c951c8d547274003c6a643307fb","authors":[{"name":"Stefano Cresci","ids":["40598011"]},{"name":"Roberto Di Pietro","ids":["1728076"]},{"name":"Marinella Petrocchi","ids":["2485749"]},{"name":"Angelo Spognardi","ids":["2549445"]},{"name":"Maurizio Tesconi","ids":["2704289"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3055135"}

Beneficial Collaborators (BCs), researchers who have a high academic level and relevant topics, can genuinely help researchers to enrich their research. Though many efforts have made to develop collaborator recommendation, most of existing works have mainly focused on recommending most possible collaborators with no intention to recommend specifically the BCs. In this paper, we propose the Beneficial Collaborator Recommendation (BCR) model that considers the dynamic research interest of researcher\u2019s and academic level of collaborators to recommend the BCs. First, we run the LDA model on the abstract of researchers\u2019 publications in each year for topic clustering. Second, we fix generated topic distribution matrix by a time function to fit interest dynamic transformation. Third, we compute the similarity between the collaboration candidate's feature matrix and the target researcher. Finally, we combine the similarity and influence in collaborators network to fix rank score and mine the candidates with high academic level and academic social impact. BCR generates the topN BCs recommendation. Extensive experiments on a dataset with citation network demonstrate that BCR performs better in terms of precision, recall, F1 score and the recommendation quality compared to baseline methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Random Walk-based Beneficial Collaborators Recommendation Exploiting Dynamic Research Interests and Academic Influence","journalPages":"1371-1377","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1ec0/11e59388f234cb35ca023669b6bbfb6afe23.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1371.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3051154"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Binding corporate rules","Bionic Commando: Rearmed","Citation network","Cluster analysis","Experiment","F1 score"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["05bb97e91dde90670aabd19aeea2ad5b8f231119","8cd9aa720a3a2f9dcb52ad9eb1bf258a80ce0648","61f31c1183950b80073ba5a231aec3e8cacb9aa9","44c6915321cd035a85aff5a7433c1de99f0c7659","213060e2c46f959030ea03b5729682b7476d7a80","0c290cb7709cde31df269dacac072e12a34882b0","46b9cd1cc0f44bbe6f2d349f1aa56faf04818edf","719e9fa4f242d6c159e08142490ffb070a679959","1650ffcae990c1179904beaa6e4f809751477305","febc02c83515f4c58a9b1ff772c75404841ba48a","1dd8db60043f51c04eb7200915ebd253d2fabf64","2463e5529e639545975e1359ecc1533ccd97bcc2","58ca8da8e71a832e225cbf5c2d00042e1e90b970","27718ec07d40dd4f0f9138e0bd40e877ac560c01","8d9461e521064f29ee0ae3a94ba6efe5da84da17","0cba3aa5b8702c6eea0f2b435b3368db0888a664","be2beae7c24866b270ea1d583ac8d2daa8e91770","695ade9ca7d69b1133297d2dc62d08a5a1003198","444f4aa49df20291689b954681c40de849d080a5","edf0626200b8e2acfbfd36e29e2ade5ae875cc4d","ac07c411af1041c3682caec5c7c4c808f59535fa","434874f4de4d7dbd3a2abd95ac5685e57054bbae","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef"],"id":"1ec011e59388f234cb35ca023669b6bbfb6afe23","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1ec011e59388f234cb35ca023669b6bbfb6afe23","authors":[{"name":"Xiangjie Kong","ids":["2123270"]},{"name":"Huizhen Jiang","ids":["3078381"]},{"name":"Teshome Megersa Bekele","ids":["40325345"]},{"name":"Wei Wang","ids":["49336891"]},{"name":"Zhenzhen Xu","ids":["50070438"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3051154"}

In this paper, we focus on the expressiveness of this framework by showing how CodeOntology can be used for static code analysis, semantic component search and code reuse.","inCitations":["f63452ded25a5229f8a231f4bbb07330a034a962","f201e1befa48d1cc7a1dab4f41e64cc0fe888cf2","d9a275cffb652179bd51fdcede79945406646761","371a0d39ef2d3c65c7de4a5eeb7c840b4547a224"],"pmid":"","title":"CodeOntology: Querying Source Code in a Semantic Framework","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3edf/672bf3951668543fb907b18530a0659abb1a.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1963/paper543.pdf"],"entities":["Code reuse","DBpedia","Entity linking","Named entity","Open-source software","Relevance","Semantic Web","Software engineering","Software system","Static program analysis","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4fa0d9c4c3d17458085ee255b7a4b7c325d59e32","837b071d4c83e0f90d3e6b6edc1a2d4ca35711fb","ab4c9fc41f6acde475d34787caca8dae9e6a3fa4","0b442bc02e32b4637b5d013b123a64d6d2646e90","335be941f0310344f74c8993dbb935d53fb191be","8fdd5012a5da2da3887d2c8e07c479d55cf5f65b","f63452ded25a5229f8a231f4bbb07330a034a962"],"id":"3edf672bf3951668543fb907b18530a0659abb1a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3edf672bf3951668543fb907b18530a0659abb1a","authors":[{"name":"Mattia Atzeni","ids":["32946276"]},{"name":"Maurizio Atzori","ids":["2413538"]}],"doi":""}

In particular, the model captures the interactions between sentences by computing the similarities of their distributional representations. Further, it can be easily trained in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is evaluated on a standard Sentence Ordering task.

The popularity of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) and location-based Internet services (e.g., Google Maps) facilitates the collection of users\u2019 locations over time. Despite recent efforts to predict users\u2019 attributes (e.g., age and gender) and social networks based on utilizing the rich location context knowledge (e.g., name, type, and description) of places of interest (e.g., restaurants and hotels) they checked-in on location-based online social networks such as Foursqure and Gowalla, little attention has been given to inferring attributes and social networks of mobile device users based on their spatiotemporal trajectories with less/no location context knowledge. In this paper we collect logs of thousands of mobile devices\u2019 network connections to wireless access points (APs) of two campuses, and investigate whether one can infer mobile device users\u2019 demographic attributes and social networks solely from their spatiotemporal AP-trajectories. We develop a tensor factorization based method Dinfer to infer mobile device users\u2019 demographic attributes from their AP-trajectories by leveraging prior knowledge, such as users\u2019 social networks. We also propose a novel method Sinfer to learn social networks between mobile device users by exploring patterns of their AP-trajectories, such as fine-grained cooccurrence events (e.g., co-coming, co-leaving, and co-presenting duration). Experimental results on real-word datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.","inCitations":["70717af3d3f02b9e4006839648a636b6605d4be4","1fff668608b49c7f513b67c006090aaa7c08d29f"],"pmid":"","title":"Inferring Demographics and Social Networks of Mobile Device Users on Campus From AP-Trajectories","journalPages":"139-147","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b101/9a1e8505b024ebe327760511b4e8c16b574f.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054140","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p139.pdf"],"entities":["AP Computer Science","Location-based service","Mobile device","Recommender system","Smartphone","Social network","Web service","Wireless access point"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0409e56956560dba788dfb3adc467f3475606c24","3d0702e5f9cc41768844228a4558344c176e1dc3","aebeceb48b24377cad4ad0b887961b21163af9cd","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","b45575e103ce17c5c15ff2569e2c4ee6253737ce","2e37d6b9a02ec31ea22252c37beae410c6b609a8","69850ad4116d5ba0e41dfe53bccfa581f6371312","ea50741d115b42928a85d46fd1f9954521811524","22a44e0d8f1a6d4ae4801a1ab89d7aa3f2c488c5","0d2b8a5c865ef8cb077d01cf4d448e092349e836","1e1d1c9a3cc9991bf64b075be899bff7440f895a","05fcf7d0f007d5beef631737a96768641b6de517","6a9320fe56989daf8c4bc57613051356f5c427c9","de86c61defbb8c259583074f3cf63afe13571ce1","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","0d8b00bd3ab292680dc0d17f8a23487b939aef63","fbe37d8cde691a27c4afaf07c57fc387b94579ca","774dd71f42cca20aa0eaf93fc337ab48fb123fd1","163358355f85c3da8960b843606e372ded0f2cff","3bb6d5834bfb355553588e382ac5f9fa8a8d831d","29bae9472203546847ec1352a604566d0f602728","2d340c6dfd8a762a618084533d41c1e0048ad967","3fefeab49d4d387eefabe170413748a028a66347","9a11e3b6824dc5b91af866576ba17046b6abdf2e","495731e9e3aeb66a6fcdcf8b87a6061fe5871994","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","57369bfc880ed89c4962d29c0af708cc8a96b10c","1ce7f038403a15c69c167941f112912a0b768b45"],"id":"b1019a1e8505b024ebe327760511b4e8c16b574f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b1019a1e8505b024ebe327760511b4e8c16b574f","authors":[{"name":"Pinghui Wang","ids":["1764969"]},{"name":"Feiyang Sun","ids":["10366903"]},{"name":"Di Wang","ids":["49370659"]},{"name":"Jing Tao","ids":["39415199"]},{"name":"Xiaohong Guan","ids":["1693616"]},{"name":"Albert Bifet","ids":["1762931"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054140"}

{"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132880","venue":"CIKM","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2017,"paperAbstract":"Social recommendation has been an active research topic over the last decade, based on the assumption that social information from friendship networks is beneficial for improving recommendation accuracy, especially when dealing with cold-start users who lack sufficient past behavior information for accurate recommendation. However, it is nontrivial to use such information, since some of a person's friends may share similar preferences in certain aspects, but others may be totally irrelevant for recommendations. Thus one challenge is to explore and exploit the extend to which a user trusts his/her friends when utilizing social information to improve recommendations. On the other hand, most existing social recommendation models are non-interactive in that their algorithmic strategies are based on batch learning methodology, which learns to train the model in an offline manner from a collection of training data which are accumulated from users? historical interactions with the recommender systems. In the real world, new users may leave the systems for the reason of being recommended with boring items before enough data is collected for training a good model, which results in an inefficient customer retention. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method for interactive social recommendation, which not only simultaneously explores user preferences and exploits the effectiveness of personalization in an interactive way, but also adaptively learns different weights for different friends. In addition, we also give analyses on the complexity and regret of the proposed model. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the improvement of our proposed method against the state-of-the-art algorithms.","inCitations":["2f1091ba1d93e4423a301200c80fd0aa0f7a60f6","f5a784a1646c06592e7de9a214f94eb7d02ff0ff"],"pmid":"","title":"Interactive Social Recommendation","journalPages":"357-366","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3132880"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cold start","Experiment","Interaction","Interactivity","Online and offline","Personalization","Recommender system","Regret (decision theory)","Relevance","Social network","User (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["114a6b4220ba12842a3845a2e39cf50a664c5bb0","846b763948bde3622d0a6a5038b98837e5b314ae","c421bec956c05b52f11af0de6e46323b0ee6abb9","fd1142a45c8cdf1d0126a304c4589d48916746eb","26d64d11bc6ae400194936f2cf0c9a5c7d156a0b","dd90dee12840f4e700d8146fb111dbc863a938ad","02d1105bec3877ed8cd2d28f76b67ae8ba3f2331","a5160db2d31d47545fb68a4a17580969e1e02f80","203c80902356a0ab088da8e5154d7097b3a51cf7","f7f72aefdf053df9e7fb2784af66f0e477272b44","d1f4460091422514b590bea1247f0ca197133b76","11465688b3e2ce4ac0208c6f016861973ffaab6e","68b464837c44e909af353f148bc79837ee4e9877","0f21eea1b6c1cfe89a3ef0a120ec62b9f7c3fda7","ac936b3f3952662d6df50553b74ae7a0d174b128","315fa6e960d244a722a42ae5f0bdf48303e2c831","0052029755e1056c8eb85ef20c684b250849b0c3","720e17a617602403d64167fcb3857035b8201373","c73287153c0a50102a40800c1ada626a410c63cc","253254f518631ab21cad201f3448b48e385eff28","6ba413be8ab11b8b052658840661473a0daf495e","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","50b4f48a4c357dab0f167c599cccff6045a4de8f","01a4a4e73c7cec89c36c7430a4ee45e1e6f7d989","336cc6866437a424448db5c358f03e3561274c29","361f5c406f71d56e18450ffe0c095e9d49badfe4","25095966f12711c677ec0322c1c2f1d28c3e7de8","7536e758f07d3dda1f381b70556828c5f15889a5","b09cea95ff23ae0c3d6009863a2633bbc0e552a8","43f296d5fa2101433417b7a0a514eb852893d5af","232c84bcdd6e92379825de06f73bdb506aeb895f","27f43696f2ae19846744b66cd97f0f93897102e7","7ed04e8ca2217ce1906864a6a64e6153afbab132","103f6fe35033f9327611ddafde74a2b544072980","91b3d1f3ca02ad593266fccf5923fc385770807c","d20208d3acbe5c085977f35e2730746860974f12","458dd9078a518a859e9ae1051b28a19f8dfa72de","f066fa9e9f999fb81da2cfbecdee898d21b3413b","5be0ae8724ac03cfc61fe360373083a786d8fef4","32bdae2b1196664abfa5b4b8fbbe87a27e9cbcf0","64c871cd7e0af7e1aeb94d98c6214eb8d8e8b989","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8","1b3c86ad6c149941750d97bd72b6b0122c1d8b5e","18cac5d010d7a1cf684e9f2bf177843fb8cd1893","236c4613771834d3cfb43c450305ade107813198","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20","544b1a65c373f405765db9814b98e54e3b45f55c"],"id":"7f3fec49112d0b0b1117f9bcc383fbb57cb22519","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7f3fec49112d0b0b1117f9bcc383fbb57cb22519","authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","ids":["48631993"]},{"name":"Steven C.

Our main contribution is a method that translates a check-in activity into an information need, which is in turn addressed with an appropriate information card. This task is challenging because of the large number of possible activities and related information needs, which need to be addressed in a mobile dashboard that is limited in size. Our approach considers each possible activity that might follow after the last (and already finished) activity, and selects the top information cards such that they maximize the likelihood of satisfying the user's information needs for all possible future scenarios. The proposed models also incorporate knowledge about the temporal dynamics of information needs. Using a combination of historical check-in data and manual assessments collected via crowdsourcing, we show experimentally the effectiveness of our approach.","inCitations":["08b650099332349637fcc0213eb1dc46d3ac4f2d","c446971a5f2ca9825e97725f7f7d53311c1a1368","2c0d0bff0bbd029034ba8373207d3426b5809b24","aaab3571a1940a2f593f3a3922e1ec1afdfdb2f0","e6d08b5a2abe34d6cfa2554d0e60323df2e3b6ce","e8809f0a51ccd4e14767a3c453457fe2c8394980","796b4c5813c61ff4ae054a1a22a13a0201a94d68","4323a97845917859c5d56d318ddc33da6ceacaa1","1f8b5b8a58bd58c2c094dfdcafa97dbf87eec77e","ea92512cb91050fe1cdd55f8ed5c302272303ffc"],"pmid":"","title":"Anticipating Information Needs Based on Check-in Activity","journalPages":"41-50","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05749","http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~noervaag/papers/WSDM2017.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05749v1.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018679"],"entities":["Crowdsourcing","Experiment","Geosocial networking","Information Card","Information needs","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2a4485189e9f03dcb7f803ef274601059a9d0843","cf1ca261068e990ede62757f758a9e18d595a71e","43a0e75a80b1270d407c442b01ced3c11fe1f02c","11ce5b9116e03bf5bdc8b254b812e05a9c61e923","46cf276bdb27dd12c4c36f35855041e79e4ec981","968dc609150f1d933b1fe222d6ebb0e3823a4522","31ab7c51219327f1b8489c4f3f6fe8f82470957e","6b6f70b7624550ac7f0e31e631bdcbd0f06521ba","50054b2cafde87fb71cfbfed966a7ddc0feada50","9d7149d9d6de520d62279ecb76cef09b3bccf61e","9b1823898a89e2be3a60f5d4b26bd771496ae5c9","9a70986bdb584cbd92f0e9be6c86590b6d77e202","579967a676efe3391d01e5141daf0289d336fd1d","01a0438352146dea1129121a94fe428d97971547","13309bd4abd75d0bbacb7d4b80944c994958237f","0fe761ed96c034c263a31679b1060c26e1be0023","a1bdfa8ec779fbf6aa780d3c63cabac2d5887b4a","4f5cd4dae6e94dc9f56446ef126c9f0f1035c468","b0b95b80690a619471ccd7bca20f5dc82afeccd7","442b0e4df04987d1aa01141b63bcec14cf483b4b","115231c739c50393751dcc3e658a6aff6fa5f5ff","c2ba242a1303a18143bd0ced075235a070084382","a9565f70db3a6b5e4ff1df272238b8d7a84a1337","485ac4ce6e1ae37da22dbc64a93bbbae6ab3ceb3","6ff05febf5beeb158c654117496a324eb0a6c13e","648c687fe50ea6f0a44c9b2e1e8bff8a06f1944c","3c2e42ae9f1f5e8b6fb82db1e1340cdf141093dd","378ccfe2f96626570b501624459ca20f4de4d5aa","b385ed55950456fbaa1d590af5f546a5e671099e","86aa6591b449f4a4caa0b41014a6f36f380398d5","99124b3d87d567fe25b455b1c1a8275073c8ab05","90b20a3359be2dce062885f811fd17ecf7ee4e3f","7326bdd632a3f2e398d01bf72ceb69eef79ae8fd","767b293237276fdbc4aae82e0db79bdbd7e45b39","28be58f9ce55e8b51d5c029987ab3ad7d513491b","160ec59f2eb9def5cca00f6c1bf198d13fb8b6a7","1ce034817e3e7fa61fd404dde4b48d8a11d4f58a","19ff005b68d6bd666347c026eff1d5d4eea1208b","4ba5509597c604f83b263ef4af8c80aed1488811","09c06f0794e49fc9e64b3ce4c31d352a66867f71","f99ca3a9432f6a4beddf822578d1c41100396e84"],"id":"d7a7166cfa3d2e71f761a4424f9b5e9b23ca903f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d7a7166cfa3d2e71f761a4424f9b5e9b23ca903f","authors":[{"name":"Jan R.

Sometimes, our task is not to train a model using those unlabeled/labeled data with missing value but process examples according to the values of some specified features. So, there is an urgent need of developing a method to predict those missing values. In this paper, we focus on learning from the known values to learn missing value as close as possible to the true one. It's difficult for us to predict missing value because we do not know the structure of the data matrix and some missing values may relate to some other missing values. We solve the problem by recovering the complete data matrix under the three reasonable constraints: feature relationship, upper recovery error bound and class relationship. The proposed algorithm can deal with both unlabeled and labeled data and generative adversarial idea will be used in labeled data to transfer knowledge. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Missing Value Learning","journalPages":"2427-2430","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133094"],"entities":["Algorithm","Experiment","Machine learning","Missing data"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"10225407c0bad5d641f4a281572c60c377bf0e33","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10225407c0bad5d641f4a281572c60c377bf0e33","authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Lin Zhao","ids":["4292453"]},{"name":"Chang-Dong Wang","ids":["1825101"]},{"name":"Kun-Yu Lin","ids":["5644670"]},{"name":"Jianhuang Lai","ids":["1750721"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133094"}

Statements can be any arbitrary piece of text, ranging from a sentence up to a paragraph. However, in many cases, citations are either outdated, missing, or link to non-existing references (e.g. dead URL, moved content etc.). In total, 20% of the cases such citations refer to news articles and represent the second most cited source. Even in cases where citations are provided, there are no explicit indicators for the span of a citation for a given piece of text. In addition to issues related with the verifiability principle, many Wikipedia entity pages are incomplete, with relevant information that is already available in online news sources missing. Even for the already existing citations, there is often a delay between the news publication time and the reference time.

Existing methods usually focus on optimizing a specific evaluation measure calculated at a fixed position, e.g., NDCG calculated at a fixed position K. In information retrieval the evaluation measures, including the widely used NDCG and P@K, are usually designed to evaluate the document ranking at all of the ranking positions, which provide much richer information than only measuring the document ranking at a single position. Thus, it is interesting to ask if we can devise an algorithm that has the ability of leveraging the measures calculated at all of the ranking postilions, for learning a better ranking model. In this paper, we propose a novel learning to rank model on the basis of Markov decision process (MDP), referred to as MDPRank. In the learning phase of MDPRank, the construction of a document ranking is considered as a sequential decision making, each corresponds to an action of selecting a document for the corresponding position. The policy gradient algorithm of REINFORCE is adopted to train the model parameters. The evaluation measures calculated at every ranking positions are utilized as the immediate rewards to the corresponding actions, which guide the learning algorithm to adjust the model parameters so that the measure is optimized. Experimental results on LETOR benchmark datasets showed that MDPRank can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.","inCitations":["ef5cb5d49716bcd754b971a9a7303d7da2cd1036","59b51782dcf4287d1f47a42422ad500d14d3cd6c","1a8192f0476084c6033b87fc059e585302145eef","92df4b85574ad6007138c75b3238913dd288ad72","f913bf77404b34abee45ad103c335eb1dde8eb29","6b0ebbaea9e91d904b1923b470fbf9a49314f620","6ef953c580fedb6bdf24fb5ebb5f2210ad77181a","34189d2ffea3bbb2be2f5ca01e66cc2848e835d9"],"pmid":"","title":"Reinforcement Learning to Rank with Markov Decision Process","journalPages":"945-948","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080685"],"entities":["Algorithm","Benchmark (computing)","Gradient","Information retrieval","Learning to rank","Markov chain","Markov decision process","Mathematical optimization","Monte Carlo","Performance","Ranking (information retrieval)","Reinforcement learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["37c415efb77e1d24da9f4350f3a93bb271cdba20","56757c983518b0604d54719df85fcd0adf789044","3d663af94807663c5df519da8792720321efa11f","c3eb86975f7fc0a4aa99b8a19bf3e0cf7a3a6646","2d1cfc9e81fb159967c2be8446a8e3e7b50fe36b","dd90dee12840f4e700d8146fb111dbc863a938ad","80ac6390e471b7159726bea0f0f8645f0eb6e478","96f0c611d68b5dac7e7ba10f66972ccdc563f1d7","361c28521f94c2f45fc1f5d49c0c150bee3778d8","4c1eb952a8799b2c46bf75bf38491af284ff3725","cde59516c81953954b9be9f16fb740ce4666def0","254687c358aff2c633e3007e8fe70f0fa0b163ee","c221cc946425d85f93c86e3be2c31d4feb00faa1","a489d95fb930401c1f4b7d92bb139d271d49abbf","ed5d79e21beccbc3a978ddd2cbd64a9e62df8499","6c37a8d20ed8fbf2f5cb7dcd039b4f45c6f3498a","15004aadabd967ac722a28a9c3bb39cf5bc32605","91b3d1f3ca02ad593266fccf5923fc385770807c"],"id":"6712a40b544683a469c292ab5a8ae087ce217c2f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6712a40b544683a469c292ab5a8ae087ce217c2f","authors":[{"name":"Zheng Wei","ids":["3133930"]},{"name":"Jun Xu","ids":["39474114"]},{"name":"Yanyan Lan","ids":["37510256"]},{"name":"Jiafeng Guo","ids":["1777025"]},{"name":"Xueqi Cheng","ids":["1717004"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080685"}

Smart cities, smart buildings, and e-health are among various application domains which are currently benefiting and will continue to benefit from IoT and Web technologies in a foreseeable future. Similarly, semantic technologies have proven their effectiveness in various domains and a few among multiple challenges which semantic Web technologies are addressing are to (i) mitigate heterogeneity by providing semantic inter-operability, (ii) facilitate easy integration of data application, (iii) deduce and extract new knowledge to build applications providing smart solutions, and (iv) facilitate inter-operability among various data processes including representation, management and storage of data. In this tutorial, our focus will be on the combination of Web technologies, Semantic Web, and IoT technologies and we will present to our audience that how a merger of these technologies is leading towards an evolution from IoT to Web of Things (WoT) to Semantic Web of Things. This tutorial will introduce the basics of Internet of Things, Web of Things and Semantic Web and will demonstrate tools and techniques designed to enable the rapid development of semantics-based Web of Things applications. One key aspect of this tutorial is to familiarize its audience with the open source tools designed by different semantic Web, IoT and WoT based projects and provide the audience a rich hands-on experience to use these tools and build smart applications with minimal efforts. Thus, reducing the learning curve to its maximum. We will showcase real-world use case scenarios which are designed using semantically-enabled WoT frameworks (e.g. CityPulse, FIESTA-IoT and M3).","inCitations":["7f58dc4f911944458b7a9bbc567ac697a5f23374","d91cb3943ce27da6dca7aa97fc54cd603a7f774f","bd94dfa2ebc302f6982b8bd1116cb6a6a56a8f65","1af203985d31bd905dcd1c9623918f81950a9108"],"pmid":"","title":"Semantic Web Meets Internet of Things and Web of Things: [2nd Edition]","journalPages":"917-920","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://hal-emse.ccsd.cnrs.fr/emse-01644361/document","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p917.pdf","http://www.eurecom.fr/en/publication/5130/download/comsys-publi-5130_1.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3041021.3051100"],"entities":["Application domain","Hands-on computing","Internet of things","Interoperability","Open-source software","Operability","Semantic Web","Smart TV","Smart city","Web of Things"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["75373ee7efaca72d4894bb2c86033a2cadeef655","a7dc02de482e6dcd16234e6a66f0848df09b6546","44542ce843ade0243628c7bbc7d83e78e2790ff7","adff42a87874246443ce5e9abc268cd168d85013","5921ee41d46fe16d95115dbaf7af5af6c6b1e1c6","9416be79edfbb072f2cddafff9ae0fe3604f5cc9","53a792ce87a651af77f40827db0bc5aed9e79ea7","f4dd2b73f1445c2e5b0a6ea3709b23403d1cc709","9b5a27f462080b8066641a43e96cfb6275d42e6a","d49bb337ab44d362af29f1cd45f6495c087c6f38","377fce75cdfd2f286c6f03606e4127ba6e4b0342","5d09f748816b0acfb91758e9f618112f542c4bb1"],"id":"f9e1ad4aea9fe7ce375e2b937b3f1b6562eef5e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f9e1ad4aea9fe7ce375e2b937b3f1b6562eef5e1","authors":[{"name":"Amelie Gyrard","ids":["3242683"]},{"name":"Pankesh Patel","ids":["39215185"]},{"name":"Soumya Kanti Datta","ids":["38121650"]},{"name":"Muhammad Intizar Ali","ids":["2529183"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3051100"}

URL rewriting is a problem for archival replay systems, especially for URLs constructed by JavaScript, that frequently results in incorrect URI references. By intercepting requests on the client using SW, we are able to strategically reroute instead of rewrite. Our implementation moves rewriting to clients, saving servers' computing resources and allowing servers to return responses more quickly. In our experiments, retrieving the original instead of rewritten pages from the archive resulted in a one- third reduction in time overhead and a one-fifth reduction in data overhead.

In this work, we study this question in the context of data streams, where elements arrive one at a time, and we want to design low-memory and fast update-time algorithms that maintain a good solution. Specifically, we focus on the sliding window model, where we are asked to maintain a solution that considers only the last W items. In this context, we provide the first non-trivial algorithm that maintains a provable approximation of the optimum using space sublinear in the size of the window. In particular we give a 1/3 − approximation algorithm that uses space polylogarithmic in the spread of the values of the elements, Φ, and linear in the solution size k for any constant > 0 . At the same time, processing each element only requires a polylogarithmic number of evaluations of the function itself. When a better approximation is desired, we show a different algorithm that, at the cost of using more memory, provides a 1/2− approximation and allows a tunable trade-off between average update time and space. This algorithm matches the best known approximation guarantees for submodular optimization in insertion-only streams, a less general formulation of the problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms on a number of real world datasets, showing that their practical performance far exceeds the theoretical bounds. The algorithms preserve high quality solutions in streams with millions of items, while storing a negligible fraction of them.","inCitations":["0b455ddce2b5d70c7d70ce307db2f05e94ebb814","7358ec03a2f0eecc259d716611a2296a724ffd78","d3610afdd69229cfd8a91e89e958caef3806b0d5","4e3f69e782337e6d9c6429473ed4f11769f64cdd","a3d0be57568882d9ee8cdd24edb4271b3686888f","ff49a0d12bf870551bf05f55ef1d1929135af54f","04376a241d021461eb55b6a8a1391679a73cfa6e","025b72a172a043331d152738f8d1c3fe5244100c","b1baf16b5840cfad6771c70ef106c12636a5148a","e1b21974e1266b0e0440b742a2d10d2478f0a897","1369fcb6fa9bf13d98188ab72d4361db30ef7b38","51fd78f60d38974e0db5afe3dfb98f249c78a96d","ed15d8eb27cb3df2374ee6d97900abe9539f2b06"],"pmid":"","title":"Submodular Optimization Over Sliding Windows","journalPages":"421-430","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bed6/5c0c0a54d28508efb64ae79fb2537bb9f6f8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052699","http://www.epasto.org/papers/fp1170-epasto.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09984","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p421.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09984v1.pdf"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Data mining","Display resolution","Diversification (finance)","Machine learning","Mathematical optimization","Microsoft Windows","Polylogarithmic function","Provable prime","Stream (computing)","Submodular set function","Window function","monotone"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a83cb80dd4ed5160c66dbd31c7782b01e7a97170","4cd73382dc17561cd276f276c61d5ebf39bf69ad","21f1c244319db25f87c54df05da5c07d07aafbb7","9dfa905a0752964bed222d9b71e4f473b00cea94","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","e77cd8265efdb21ff0fa5251c4476c7297a90f52","99ba32eb17d05f63297b1fb067a515c2a354cc7b","cc9e2321bd6b1c46fa4847b8b8af60fbd0555c03","72b992cd5b0461d3922d61aba4e13fd71fd9bb79","0f491624578a99e197e2fcfde710371c386ff513","843f186c7f38f5d434f46ca55b6dea7d5f14deef","2f9f77ee4fa453cd114665f8b487570c0affe235","5dacca459e9cc4fec59be31d7a685a46e056cc00","82afdb9f6b3441bbe4e8a5d6e1d0f5a647748d68","047d078f6cfed4cc067643b5e15f4e8f65a97c0b","3d25eb8241345f86101fda145d95d89c27844fd1","04311b15b444a0f75ea2bb74fca26cc1aefbf3c1","f19dbebc5821baead29708e3d1e7b4b70f2c7d48","28dd94325f1fe6a8ea5787abe3bbdf7dfea71259","abbdb6177b4408c5885a569dc24e6361f91cf169","a7ccb9bbdb4fc36a02e1290e7f50bb279dc6bc36","8f63361bd17d8a5a22f0651f7bf013bbfbdde653","379ef18377d803d87859314c0e110cdf64f2ea73","b9e43395663f74c581982e9ca97a0d7057a0008c"],"id":"bed65c0c0a54d28508efb64ae79fb2537bb9f6f8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bed65c0c0a54d28508efb64ae79fb2537bb9f6f8","authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Epasto","ids":["3356743"]},{"name":"Silvio Lattanzi","ids":["1895843"]},{"name":"Sergei Vassilvitskii","ids":["1749789"]},{"name":"Morteza Zadimoghaddam","ids":["1724391"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052699"}

Specifically, we explore methods for using native Arabic script queries to retrieve Arabic tweets written in a Roman script known as Arabizi. For example, a query for \u201cبباتك\u201d would not match \u201ckitab\u201d even though an Arabic reader would see them as the same word. Moreover, because of the lack of Arabic script, automatic language identification methods fail to recognize the Arabizi text as Arabic and label it as English, Polish, or the like. We propose a cross-script retrieval system using automatic rule-based mapping and statistical selection of transliteration keywords. We show that our system can achieve effective cross-script retrieval with minimal knowledge of the target language and without the need to rely on external translation or transliteration tools or lexica. With minimal human annotation, our technique can be applied to other languages such as Hindi and Greek, which are commonly converted to a Roman character set similarly.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"On Cross-Script Information Retrieval","journalPages":"796-802","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8efe/77b4e6598fe8eac936fd95d5bee82f011422.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://maroo.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1180","http://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1180","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_70"],"entities":["Arabic chat alphabet","Character encoding","Compiler","Information retrieval","Language identification","Lexicon","Logic programming"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["53ac234b5c0950bc5240a48fa7077e9f728f9547","ccfdd6f8f83fab4e3d9045352532ae905e931cd1","4fbe1e8f65f4c71565e8e6eb47c0c3a78a182bf3","681ae675c6fe087f5eb29aa89a5a3bcc91c6df4c","c76ebcdb807a40d194c76e18484700d70c59b214","3527e7feaf1445c84ba3396582ed482805a499b2","433b5f1de7f789795febf6e28717104c7b8a3d98","2bc10e008ffb8ab9ae43f032e589109d1ec00287","445ddeb2d786ab4f9a4c6a14a1f14ebd06db481d","bbdadcfc63aad4f11b8a9913f5560df0bf0445c6","138fd63755ea9b6c6f946ed9ca92dc6011df942b","a5902740c0379206d6d198a68a83ed26c4882be3"],"id":"8efe77b4e6598fe8eac936fd95d5bee82f011422","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8efe77b4e6598fe8eac936fd95d5bee82f011422","authors":[{"name":"Nada Naji","ids":["41077617"]},{"name":"James Allan","ids":["1722517"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_70"}

It has been shown that some relevant documents act like \"poison pills,\" i.e. they hurt the performance of feedback systems despite the fact that they are relevant. In this paper, we study the positive counterpart of this by investigating the helpfulness of nonrelevant documents in feedback. In general, we find that although documents that are explicitly judged as non-relevant are normally assumed to be poisonous for feedback systems, sometimes considering high-scored non-relevant documents as a positive feedback helps to improve the performance of retrieval. In our experimental data, we observe a considerable fraction of non-relevant documents in higher ranked positions of the initial retrieval run, for most of the topics. Hence, by ignoring the potential value of non-relevant documents, we may loose a lot of useful information. We investigate the potential contribution of non-relevant documents using existing state-of-the-art feedback methods. Our main findings are the following. First, we find that some of the nonrelevant documents are exclusively helpful, they improve retrieval on their own, and others are complementary helpful, they lead to further improvement when added to a set of relevant documents. Second, we discover that, on average, exclusively helpful non-relevant documents have a higher contribution to the performance improvement, compared to the complementary ones. Third, we show that non-relevant documents in topics with poor average precision in the initial retrieval are more likely to help in the feedback.","inCitations":["e6d3cd1dbc0ed1b98f749f6714f83264d5346d1d","511e040ba116ced7517475dd21d7ebd0ac96bf8d","ee0185185838103059157f91c5e1f8b7d45c0b5e","17a0182ee8d12aa2491a1f4309afe84e6869b2a0"],"pmid":"","title":"The Healing Power of Poison: Helpful Non-relevant Documents in Feedback","journalPages":"2065-2068","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983910"],"entities":["Complement (complexity)","Document","Experiment","Extensibility","Positive feedback","Vocabulary"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e9b928aa2aacfefe2a1eddd864dc34cabdbd1dc7","303eef410700063913f9e6ad349a0830dbccefb8","f971bf00097e90e71dce51c65fc266504dece86a","233a4f0998e37b3997d5fbb6ce0746f063578eaa","d65e8e3ea41a082dab6805fdf7d2763712b04a8b","5334943d02e0af57198abbca1db22b8ac22f3a13","1b24beb21c3dbeb1de9d9df00c54cd80b88c1f22","cc3ad7545f45949d9c4a32f2ceb5b643fb14e514","15563cfc37aa0dac7a586f4d0326a58f0e0caea0","409b889d0d2991a4e9b7bf48bd649ca014752a7d","1cb9f24a4bda0c1722ae72d24e6d4045187471b5","21a204892f21ccf8db43a250db673e287d3479e6","17a0182ee8d12aa2491a1f4309afe84e6869b2a0","2b3e1b56736c3e4081e7d5fc5993d35aaf27fe18","39487bfa4482bafba996a92055b901f0cdc018a8"],"id":"b6f6137e15b3190bf3f6e2a81382bb1aaf3d6e2c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6f6137e15b3190bf3f6e2a81382bb1aaf3d6e2c","authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Dehghani","ids":["3226635"]},{"name":"Samira Abnar","ids":["2786352"]},{"name":"Jaap Kamps","ids":["1753628"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983910"}

InstantEspresso answers questions of the form «Which European politicians are related to politicians in the United States, and how?» or «How can one summarize the relationship between China and countries from the Middle East?» Each question is specified by two sets of query entities. These sets (e. g. European politicians or United States politicians) can be determined by an initial graph query over a knowledge graph capturing relationships between real-world entities. InstantEspresso analyzes the (indirect) relationships that connect entities from both sets and provides a user-friendly explanation of the answer in the form of concise subgraphs. These so-called relatedness cores correspond to important event complexes involving entities from the two sets. Our system provides a user interface for the specification of entity sets and displays a visually appealing visualization of the extracted subgraph to the user. The demonstrated system can be used to provide background information on the current state-of-affairs between realworld entities such as politicians, organizations, and the like, e. g. to a journalist preparing an article involving the entities of interest.

The rapid development of crowdsourcing platforms led to a significant reduction of the cost of manual labeling. This makes it possible to collect very large sets of labeled documents to train a ranking algorithm. However, relevance labels acquired via crowdsourcing are typically coarse and noisy, so certain consensus models are used to measure the quality of labels and to reduce the noise. This noise is likely to affect a ranker trained on such labels, and, since none of the existing consensus models directly optimizes ranking quality, one has to apply some heuristics to utilize the output of a consensus model in a ranking algorithm, e.g., to use majority voting among workers to get consensus labels. The major goal of this paper is to unify existing approaches to consensus modeling and noise reduction within a learning to rank framework. Namely, we present a machine learning algorithm aimed at improving the performance of a ranker trained on a crowdsourced dataset by proper remapping of labels and reweighting of samples. In the experimental part, we use several characteristics of workers/labels extracted via various consensus models in order to learn the remapping and reweighting functions. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that we can significantly improve state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms by incorporating our framework.","inCitations":["a5c6391df70d923dd5f5c2981432eb0382c863c8"],"pmid":"","title":"An Optimization Framework for Remapping and Reweighting Noisy Relevance Labels","journalPages":"105-114","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911501"],"entities":["Algorithm","Crowdsourcing","Experiment","Heuristic (computer science)","Learning to rank","Machine learning","Noise reduction","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2404917609f169ed95208b12c3dc94b677f0400b","316e1466922a7504eb4c0baa2ebb2dca03ba7bf1","168620e40f260cbbf6e681bf4cf63bad2b6b3ad5","04c12fbdd04cf67a965e628d40b9098c8a7114b3","01c1795d00e1ad4a69c5dd3498a38715ca898833","a62aee83789003435a5610c05283cb2c2b85a77a","86d2add9aa90014a6330e3eb59277562adaeeda4","3d663af94807663c5df519da8792720321efa11f","169404f79e4453fbad46a6c24e17e081aa44fefd","48caac2f65bce47f6d27400ae4f60d8395cec2f3","941fa393bd1c5efc14fb4a9934de5b4351b1c7f9","0bda6a2b5ed513048fdfc7d09ff4db67767e1d9d","097ea6ad168ae6729ea0392b541762490b57b473","6953420c593842697dd09bc2cf7ffbbaf67a6e8e","40c6e880da4fa9d3266e2ce60342b20a1eca106e","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","1d81f37488a6c492d5dd2733d485c9b014e9eeb4","451de5fc736bfa3284b1ae5c5d9c0e1fb1c2f0c8","5939cd8180a7139d878a1b2150d9772d29fdecb5","2c8f24f859bbbc4193d4d83645ef467bcf25adc2"],"id":"02c1abca74834eabf18b1b7aa535d770a3cd07b3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/02c1abca74834eabf18b1b7aa535d770a3cd07b3","authors":[{"name":"Yury Ustinovsky","ids":["2361592"]},{"name":"Valentina Fedorova","ids":["48549268"]},{"name":"Gleb Gusev","ids":["40217411"]},{"name":"Pavel Serdyukov","ids":["1708801"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2911501"}

Can we do this for different malware and countries? This is an important question which has numerous implications for cyber security, right from designing better anti-virus software, to designing and implementing targeted patches to more accurately measuring the economic impact of breaches. This problem is compounded by the fact that, as externals, we can only detect a fraction of actual malware infections. In this paper we address this problem using data from Symantec covering more than 1.4 million hosts and 50 malware spread across 2 years and multiple countries. We first carefully design domain-based features from both malware and machine-hosts perspectives. Secondly, inspired by epidemiological and information diffusion models, we design a novel temporal non-linear model for malware spread and detection. Finally we present ESM, an ensemble-based approach which combines both these methods to construct a more accurate algorithm. Using extensive experiments spanning multiple malware and countries, we show that ESM can effectively predict malware infection ratios over time (both the actual number and trend) upto 4 times better compared to several baselines on various metrics. Furthermore, ESM's performance is stable and robust even when the number of detected infections is low.","inCitations":["b4849bb63f829ade3686b2717cc5001d29d96afc","9cef900358e09b42c813d6a157ec115d035ac756","55835dfea70271b5c2d92b8b0b59265b05cff552","1d699373e2e5719d405cdad38af7cfd361c2f572","563381042486f54768c476e8abf76898ef231f6c","bcf80e69c284faf6ce90980b066a100f7a06da1a","9cdde7387542ba238f60cf5ba5e677565ed05dcb","69141060f7d9671d47cd59063bbd078e1efd41ab"],"pmid":"","title":"Ensemble Models for Data-driven Prediction of Malware Infections","journalPages":"583-592","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://people.cs.vt.edu/~badityap/papers/wine-ensemble-wsdm16.pdf","http://ai2-s2-pdf-tmp.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdf63.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2835776.2835834","http://people.cs.vt.edu/badityap/papers/wine-ensemble-wsdm16.pdf","https://www.cs.umd.edu/~vs/pubs/p583-kang.pdf","https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/news_release_pdfs/p583-kang.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Antivirus software","Computer security","Ensemble forecasting","Experiment","File spanning","Linear model","Malware","Nonlinear system"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0ebb041524a751276219a396c634da15742a6e6a","92cbc4c773faab8208f97198e3173c60e459c11f","6a7c311ca3875f54543065f201a16ef1ac606c99","4117f4283eaf8abe19a9133f2d3390bf86afba59","c91800e299d9a04e85e2ae856b0e10ea9df7f9ff","b11b021b93cc17e4141d4ad41a9acb66fecc7bed","19403910710bbb7cff44bece752a4cd171467c10","4d106f6048915a94401fc5ea0870925092aa457e","82d5304042597f7e15ba0d1b77264f5efd0e7895","0d11248c42d5a57bb28b00d64e21a32d31bcd760","35df1dcd036d8720525f95ee9330ed496f3dab42","5880497106a0e3b4a16fe5c0026673f8daade248","3f0cea1a79bed83ef2b41f6642eb8f8979e5f508","0302f692e8abb8575c4706d2fa1146309422c44b","66368ba9b91889872d53639d3d77d7cf9825d734","962858c9324e014adffcc10ea445cd68f9261c35","573f88b583d19719ed212ee2e153044c3dff51cf","2f98cee40a3bf83dc5ab089bbd229e9550c39179","af1734d3f729f4123d1c696d665454993a754eed","35fb2347d62585c2af850d6327ab43e32974a40e","26a82cdfa5d16b1271e46d91adbfb3300b74aa57","5fcee9642349a83ccc561d7e76d4e4418d02bb95","b52a59bc6d724512642dd7331ee8d397ae8eab29"],"id":"03bdc4705bc238cea757a359bb5003b350760933","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03bdc4705bc238cea757a359bb5003b350760933","authors":[{"name":"Chanhyun Kang","ids":["1728619"]},{"name":"Noseong Park","ids":["5166698"]},{"name":"B.

A flurry of recent research has quantified this, highlighting the expansion of its underlying connectivity network. However, improving the infrastructure is not useful without appropriately provisioned services to utilise it. This paper measures the availability of web content infrastructure in Africa. Whereas others have explored web infrastructure in developed regions, we shed light on practices in developing regions. To achieve this, we apply a comprehensive measurement methodology to collect data from a variety of sources. We focus on a large content delivery network to reveal that Africa\u2019s content infrastructure is, indeed, expanding. However, we find much web content is still served from the US and Europe. We discover that many of the problems faced are actually caused by significant inter-AS delays in Africa, which contribute to local ISPs not sharing their cache capacity. We discover that a related problem is the poor DNS configuration used by some ISPs, which confounds the attempts of providers to optimise their delivery. We then explore a number of other websites to show that large web infrastructure deployments are a rarity in Africa and that even regional websites host their services abroad. We conclude by making suggestions for improvements.","inCitations":["ca5ff0e12f50b4d7dee511766ae1e0d395b658e3","2f9a09f06eec629431c495fc3f3f0b9d973b7544","ac50d492c8013c04644154333e279eb67df40f0a","174f6ee1ef6c1ca3eb3259da24da0fdac2f2d2eb","5553ea8b369f87931529439f10aabe3ca5fa65dc","04cd8b630d61e562b2d75d6eecfb8a40eb8b7466","89283ee665da63ec9cf87e4008ead3e8963fa02b","2508187a069379f762f4111f17e87a73df13fc85","15fe335fa8572766bbf2e2f6edfc157351c717d5","e0515650cccbd2e174bc032e0451dd8a9a1222e0","7fde0f6ba124f59a4f4bd93ba00a15112caab6bd","ba99b4391b03a71e23335af0f162b41e941abd23","d813dd66acf9cbe3817583b6d7232736e76a3fa8","a255363a029790abd798c4b6686e828fbe7ee2c9","9a1913d9634c2b35da4d824b267b596851211634","cb10530a86a5d9abd9ab4a7e6deb489189ed387a"],"pmid":"","title":"Pushing the Frontier: Exploring the African Web Ecosystem","journalPages":"435-445","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a834/63d7ace91478a9fa5f302d0b4c2f8819cd43.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~as2330/docs/WWW15.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~as2330/docs/WWW15.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2882997","https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/11241/Tyson%20Pushing%20the%20Frontier%202016%20Accepted.pdf?sequence=1","http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~tysong/files/WWW16.pdf"],"entities":["CPU cache","Content delivery network","Ecosystem","Front and back ends","Hypertext Transfer Protocol","Internet","LIA-UFSCar","Load (computing)","Norm (social)","Peering","Quality of service","RIFE","Software deployment","Victor Animatograph Corporation","Web content","While","ZoneAlarm"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["00b34627fa6cecb3584d0833c4de89686df3a091","2c55cc95b6014bfa3f34307af141d0ddaa771c64","1c7d0f188a8033d8a14ab3ae30662f7e85fa65b6","76e679a60d46f4f4a85a5d893d08a0fcc712a800","78410760a22280ce6413fcc1cc32ed1501541ac6","3ba7b86da88a0119bfd9af9897b7cc3a23e7d417","42f47727d27fedb90289720f81fabf176860ddea","3a0119a905d674b08cda2136009c9b3980863eb8","22cb1b05afddc1a8138c16184fbbaaf7530867ff","32f84721be8c2e6db2ddcde053a7dca50a1d22aa","f258497c8e57a885656ed5125cc4d8c95c57cf57","161d9c0156656cce193b64434c3264ed94445d59","03a141f5445c7cfab3a9c6267b12d06c6e67490d","a097c201e3410cb943eb6a336f4af1516e6a33e2","7bb292ee9450389551ee07dcef0cbce709aa1e9d"],"id":"a83463d7ace91478a9fa5f302d0b4c2f8819cd43","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a83463d7ace91478a9fa5f302d0b4c2f8819cd43","authors":[{"name":"Rodérick Fanou","ids":["2730023"]},{"name":"Gareth Tyson","ids":["1749012"]},{"name":"Pierre François","ids":["38044311"]},{"name":"Arjuna Sathiaseelan","ids":["3205987"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872427.2882997"}

In these applications, one query pattern is especially prominent: a join between a continuous data stream and some background data (BGD). Oftentimes, the target BGD is large, maintained externally, changing slowly, and costly to query (both in terms of time and money). Hence, practical applications usually maintain a local (cached) view of the relevant BGD. Given that these caches are not updated as the original BGD, they should be refreshed under realistic budget constraints (in terms of latency, computation time, and possibly financial cost) to avoid stale data leading to wrong answers. This paper proposes to model the join between streams and the BGD as a bipartite graph. By exploiting the graph structure, we keep the quality of results good enough without refreshing the entire cache for each evaluation. We also introduce two extensions to this method: first, we consider a continuous join between recent portions of a data stream and some BGD to focus on updates that have the longest effect. Second, we consider the future impact of a query to the BGD by proposing to delay some updates to provide fresher answers in future. By extending an existing stream processor with the proposed policies, we empirically show that we can improve result freshness by 93% over baseline algorithms such as Random Selection or Least Recently Updated.","inCitations":["954f73b7c1934d8a5763c56f5b976c8878a95ef1","f0c90e93fe689be11507a9e7ab627a5b72784a6b"],"pmid":"","title":"Planning Ahead: Stream-Driven Linked-Data Access Under Update-Budget Constraints","journalPages":"252-270","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/43bc/8c65a0eeb18912f22a88242023828f4b811a.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://videolectures.net/site/normal_dl/tag=1086383/iswc2016_gao_planning_ahead_01.pdf","http://www.dellaglio.org/preprints/16c4.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_16"],"entities":["Aggregate data","Aggregate function","Algorithm","Approximation algorithm","Baseline (configuration management)","Border Gateway Protocol","Cache (computing)","Computation","Data access","Experiment","Exploit (computer security)","Form-based authentication","Greedy algorithm","Heuristic (computer science)","Knowledge base","Linked data","Mathematical optimization","Money","Optimization problem","Principle of good enough","Quality of results","Replay attack","Response time (technology)","SPARQL","SQL","Scalability","Selectivity (electronic)","Stream processing","Super Bit Mapping","Time complexity","USB On-The-Go"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["82c8129c19b91cbbfdcd41d83c115d06ffe4e81e","2dbe6e8a70c9c4340435cf09231f32fd7f49a1e1","80eab41f4862458192a49114ab175613fe40e292","aa4a247d32217a0c1413f9efeba409d52f83ed11","1afe1057455a7a93aa2c927ad32a7c36275f532a","033ab067affedb485f7a528e54634971132901ca","e1898674e3a81fd9f7983eefcfdd05a5db9fc33c","109999bb9b2e0020298db40c27e190ad8d5e7442","066bc89b014159a911d05b6afef6ea2b8cc9002a","4f353f80c73e6a65988a154a60da8dc88470af43","d241a63b832833c5d0db30a369b9861d006b49cf","c402d44550a712600fd39221241bdef66f43ecdb","66efc5aa3dc973c95234074cf0625979e7ac40a2","11de66b6a20d075274c2d0a65070f369ea2b81e6","a344a7443895bf532e46aa3e4a3a80c11f58f6b9","0ce09c9ffc75f456cb77a5ec6f57fc9262da819d","293130ab45d71e80c2648ed76ea90004221f7c2b","2bdf0f42a66d9976f86813d34255da1a4035b722","07e225064639af4ddc898d40b68021c43f92f012","07aba6ea790f0c2345b9304f4c379d4a74030956","d08df76164d323bea648a4bc0a84203abc8a62a8","3a69b1052baf116d6b49a2d23ec67d29dfd138ce"],"id":"5acb907708c0967bdac4d7cc9db1857094df1d60","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5acb907708c0967bdac4d7cc9db1857094df1d60","authors":[{"name":"Shen Gao","ids":["2345018"]},{"name":"Daniele Dell'Aglio","ids":["2307349"]},{"name":"Soheila Dehghanzadeh","ids":["3123702"]},{"name":"Abraham Bernstein","ids":["1780758"]},{"name":"Emanuele Della Valle","ids":["2539248"]},{"name":"Alessandra Mileo","ids":["1758781"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_16"}

An important aspect of the model is the integration of relevance oriented and support oriented features.","inCitations":["395a558125d6adb4de79d220a0a8ba9810881334","0067eecf8b510612274d9be331f366ad51d9b561","9785f21ac0b33689dc3ae711a94383eda01785e9","2b622e9fa1d5e1a25492280b2e4e5e7ad9970b38","762df408fc532135a7177fc0590dc8663642b892","f6eaa5684c6c792cfd502ef585a805748efb3498","d3cdfc1e05b20a14a00a49aa9e5dba36670862f7","37f54ef89c0744dba373397a34c07e6e4b9e852f","88c5093bc9ee41da842e28051aa41e54ab63769c"],"pmid":"","title":"Supporting Human Answers for Advice-Seeking Questions in CQA Sites","journalPages":"129-141","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7821/20110f696343bb7ab662fe090e7a0194c3c8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://ie.technion.ac.il/~kurland/cqaSupport.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_10"],"entities":["Learning to rank","Question answering","Relevance","Textual entailment","Wikipedia","World Wide Web","Yahoo!

We quantitatively investigate a series of efforts known as the Polymath projects, which tackle mathematical research problems through open online discussion. A key analytical insight is that we can contrast the polymath projects with mini-polymaths \u2014 spinoffs that were conducted in the same manner as the polymaths but aimed at addressing math Olympiad questions, which, while quite difficult, are known to be feasible. Our comparative analysis shifts between three elements of the projects: the roles and relationships of the authors, the temporal dynamics of how the projects evolved, and the linguistic properties of the discussions themselves. We find interesting differences between the two domains through each of these analyses, and present these analyses as a template to facilitate comparison between Polymath and other domains for collaboration and communication. We also develop models that have strong performance in distinguishing research-level comments based on any of our groups of features. Finally, we examine whether comments representing research breakthroughs can be recognized more effectively based on their intrinsic features, or by the (re-)actions of others, and find good predictive power in linguistic features.","inCitations":["66f32e44131b6eab0ed66e91fafa33278fc4bfa4"],"pmid":"","title":"Internet Collaboration on Extremely Difficult Problems: Research versus Olympiad Questions on the Polymath Site","journalPages":"1283-1292","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6354/bb3a2731ff0778fd7e7aea663e142ec05bc2.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883023","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/www16-polymath.pdf","http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/proceedings/p1283.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/kleinber/www16-polymath.pdf","https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/www16-polymath.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/polymath.pdf"],"entities":["Internet","Nonlinear gameplay","Open-source software","Qualitative comparative analysis"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["03f36663f69899238949b75c680f1f32fa5d256c","5161289e88b0d8eaef95ab59962aae789f1b8e1e","4acf4471693ab4be6767915c228fe882b03f583c","26a14cef6fae5a7793d8dbda2c8faf7a89d4ef96","2c1c912d3f52a504211170da758625212d317357","387404b5f5fa7158ab19a466ce925eea72e735c6","30593ad852efa6b0f7b21c0413041f9ae9d06e51","c01c801b0b1f10fc02179ffdc6e7dea8d2604301","a717c0779d452a0176b1253e10eb4784a0d22bfe","9eb8e310f3eafcb5369af3d7ad215b9006d6a220","12f806ec40bc0d4199fe90867195397b7a41a22a","02a3e80e574f86e8d79935d52709168798b1eec2","bd966db0ec07464d882b21bf63a9064528c3e0a8"],"id":"6354bb3a2731ff0778fd7e7aea663e142ec05bc2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6354bb3a2731ff0778fd7e7aea663e142ec05bc2","authors":[{"name":"Isabel M.

The simplest machine learning setup for text classification uses a unigram bag-of-words feature representation of documents, and this has been shown to work well for a number of tasks such as spam detection and topic classification. However, the problem of sentiment analysis is more complex and not as easily captured with unigram (single-word) features. Bigram and trigram features capture certain local context and short distance negations\u2014thus outperforming unigram bag-of-words features for sentiment analysis. But higher order n-gram features are often overly specific and sparse, so they increase model complexity and do not generalize well. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of skip-gram features for large scale sentiment analysis. We demonstrate that skip-grams can be used to improve sentiment analysis performance in a model-efficient and scalable manner via regularized logistic regression. The feature sparsity problem associated with higher order n-grams can be alleviated by grouping similar n-grams into a single skip-gram: For example, \u201cwaste time\u201d could match the n-gram variants \u201cwaste of time\u201d, \u201cwaste my time\u201d, \u201cwaste more time\u201d, \u201cwaste too much time\u201d, \u201cwaste a lot of time\u201d, and so on. To promote model-efficiency and prevent overfitting, we demonstrate the utility of logistic regression incorporating both L1 regularization (for feature selection) and L2 regularization (for weight distribution).","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"An Empirical Study of Skip-Gram Features and Regularization for Learning on Sentiment Analysis","journalPages":"72-87","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://www.chengli.io/publications/li2016empirical.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_6","http://www.chengli.io/publications/li2016empirical_slides.pdf"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["18768ab2db59e14253c71bd75bf8481554620060","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e","a0968b29aa9d4d5aae6456d7c1dbbe62fbfa9b0d","173a36d8bd6141c550894fe01b2a9addb7b38a52","7fd394ecd939d0f3c898d265fc366dd689e88857","5e9fa46f231c59e6573f9a116f77f53703347659","24961554811a6161095c5eaebccf1aebaacd7fd5","8947ca4949fc66eb65f863dfb825ebd90ab01772","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","90d5e149632627e573ef9cf4becbeb2517e89864","4f1fe957a29a2e422d4034f4510644714d33fb20","79ffd2bc4a9d10ef81282da5ecbf5b08922dd46e","458d48e1baa7394a4fa43a745411bfd2982108f9","0a5feab178ddb179a37f3a19b69b4a956ed797d8","1c61f9ef06fe74505775a833ff849185757199e7","2ea31456d9319664bc01d361dfad2fdf1c48e596","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0"],"id":"a47ceb934deb783ae3a109bb71a963fdae2c9b09","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a47ceb934deb783ae3a109bb71a963fdae2c9b09","authors":[{"name":"Cheng Li","ids":["46651787"]},{"name":"Bingyu Wang","ids":["49292097"]},{"name":"Virgil Pavlu","ids":["1682491"]},{"name":"Javed A.

In particular, we introduce AID-FD, an algorithm that approximately discovers FDs within runtimes up to orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art FD discovery algorithms.

This provides a way to query graph databases that neither requires mastery of a query language such as SPARQL, nor a deep knowledge of the database schema. We demonstrate eGraphSearch, a new system for effective keyword search in graph databases. Previous work ranks answer trees using combinations of structural and content-based metrics, such as path length between keywords or relevance of the labels in the answer tree to the query keywords. However, different nodes in the graph might have different importance, which affects the utility of the answer. In the proposed system, we implemented two new ways to rank keyword search results over graphs: the first one takes node importance into account while the second one is a bi-objective optimization of edge weights and node importance. In the demonstration, participants will execute keyword queries against several popular graph datasets.","inCitations":["9d6f766ed22c19e498742ed1babcc0fb9a770f2a"],"pmid":"","title":"eGraphSearch: Effective Keyword Search in Graphs","journalPages":"2461-2464","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983333"],"entities":["Database schema","Graph database","Graph labeling","Mathematical optimization","Objective-C","Query language","Relevance","SPARQL","Search algorithm","Tree (data structure)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1e37906f48df09bab035c25de540f9a089df3cc8","44b9dd30dfc677b50ca67d0c41fc73c5569bb468","3c0b574b98e2fae687f021d77637e24e2d2d641f","10b13d1d7ce00845058a04fea59dc55f1db412d5","33f9d88f0cf532d114173c06598842b89c1361d5"],"id":"e6fbb8081f7805c8dc16936d932523230a8880b2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e6fbb8081f7805c8dc16936d932523230a8880b2","authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Kargar","ids":["36626057"]},{"name":"Lukasz Golab","ids":["1688834"]},{"name":"Jaroslaw Szlichta","ids":["1806938"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983333"}

Currently, subexpressions occurring repeatedly in Pig Latin scripts are executed as many times as they appear, and the current Pig Latin optimizer does not identify reuse opportunities. We present a novel optimization approach aiming at identifying and reusing repeated subexpressions in Pig Latin scripts. Our optimization algorithm, named PigReuse, identifies subexpression merging opportunities, selects the best ones to execute based on a cost function, and reuses their results as needed in order to compute exactly the same output as the original scripts. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","inCitations":["ffa3789f1e00cb394f6aa8efabd31f75d8df802a","96891359741488ab15bb4737c99f7d7dbc7846fa","ab451a84432c1ba1eeb8d696f7df43bcce5d3f37","1603f2ee525226f474853267bf1d5867f17d9dcb"],"pmid":"","title":"Reuse-based Optimization for Pig Latin","journalPages":"2215-2220","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983669"],"entities":["Algorithm","Experiment","Loss function","Mathematical optimization","Parallel computing","Program optimization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b8ff6c465c5d1c5ad5f520c6a7470230178bc1e3","b2c28faec6f88bbfec636cf4cc10e40b04f33284","9b1ad966798f606278684afadc5e6c210169f1ef","3e60ef911adea3dbc771a07d8c388d47a2cf0d8d","291470e5e557ac526f79a59c83e98fbf53406401","6b437acfe29a67ab8c6d6c504831daa1a547b955","04700bcc5abfad47d11b67a2d9901f01c8f0adf5","3ca63ef954e07b65e67c50bdd9f443815c80fc44","ef2a7d0800aa9d959229dbbca5a39d4c77222265","8d1aa2db67f214bf4b396d26240330a2ea00bd9a","5aa579a8b83169a075c01f9e8cff54bd218d466b","0e4338405cbb17659d093062a79fa4ec1e0107ed","645f7926278dfc6eadbe8eb6c2c6fd57d0d7dba3","06fb8f5e59bac8b014e7ab70851b3568ea5a0a46","ad54be29be71e31319235cceef0911b72e06c659","0f288da3454e8d5750dd319962a28cabe07709a6","18e9f339190be7a12223186ca2cab8e07267efc0","d38fe15fb0a37a8200744da7e987580bfd797cd1","4a81486f7f1d03d547e78046fc154a6890d8eabd","70710393392d68dbaac8eae940886df31af2b642"],"id":"67e4ec020d43e2e87a64606f9aa002a515cf7a58","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/67e4ec020d43e2e87a64606f9aa002a515cf7a58","authors":[{"name":"Jesús Camacho-Rodríguez","ids":["2248323"]},{"name":"Dario Colazzo","ids":["1691789"]},{"name":"Melanie Herschel","ids":["46279101"]},{"name":"Ioana Manolescu","ids":["1739309"]},{"name":"Soudip Roy Chowdhury","ids":["37884573"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983669"}

To this end, the TPF proposal trades off an increased client-side query processing effort for a significant reduction of server load. However, an additional aspect of this trade-off is a very high network load. To mitigate this drawback we propose to extend the interface by augmenting TPF requests with an optional VALUES clause as introduced in SPARQL 1.1. This extension enables clients to attach intermediate results to triple pattern requests. The response to such a request is expected to contain triples from the underlying dataset that do not only match the given triple pattern, but that also are guaranteed to contribute in a join with the given intermediate result. Hence, given such an extended interface\u2014which we call BindingsRestricted Triple Pattern Fragments (brTPF)\u2014the execution of joins can be distributed between client and server by using the well-known bind join strategy [1]. In an ongoing research project we study the trade-offs of the brTPF interface and compare it to the pure TPF interface. With a poster in the conference we aim to present initial results of this research. In particular, we would like to present a series of experiments showing that distributed, bind-join-based query executions using the brTPF interface reduce the network load drastically. In the remainder of this extended abstract, we describe these experiments, discuss their results, and elaborate on the open research questions that will drive the next steps of our ongoing work regarding brTPF.

These complicated needs usually require the users to reform different queries and conduct multiple retrievals in a search session. There are a lot of technologies are developed to help session searches. Riccho, pseudo relevance feedback, and etc. can help finding relevant documents. xQuAD, RxQuAD, and etc. can help the user to explore. However none of these approaches alone works well in session searches, because they don't treat a search session as a whole. They can't answer questions like when to explore and when to exploit. In this work, we model session searches as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). We model user's implicit feedbacks, such as query reformulation and user clickthrough data into the POMDP framework. Further we extend the forms of user feedbacks. We implement a new search interface which allows us to capture more explicit feedbacks from users, such as passage level relevance judgments, irrelevant judgments, duplicate judgment, and etc. We propose algorithms to effectively model these feedback signals into the POMDP framework and improve session search performance. Our algorithm is able to automatically balance users' needs of exploration and exploitation.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling User Feedback in Dynamic Search and Browsing","journalPages":"1177","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://cs-class.uis.georgetown.edu/~jl1749/homepage/papers/sigir2016_dc.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911483"],"entities":["Algorithm","Browsing","Exploit (computer security)","Information needs","Markov chain","Partially observable Markov decision process","Relevance feedback","Session (web analytics)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["52b774f80252289f288a4483b6f98b567b615493","ded1fa5432e066c3a9f998bd52c6ed736068c582","5a1906f2129a398d4276cbd9b9ce58da1ef21417","116d7798c1123cf7fad4176e98f58fd49de4f8f1"],"id":"ae15761e8c65225b3780db453105d3c856bfd9d6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ae15761e8c65225b3780db453105d3c856bfd9d6","authors":[{"name":"Jiyun Luo","ids":["39503804"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2911483"}

Questions asking for descriptions or explanations are much more difficult to be solved, e.g., the machine learning models cannot focus on specific answer words or their lexical type. Thus, researchers have started to explore powerful methods for feature engineering. Two of the most promising methods are convolution tree kernels (CTKs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as they have been shown to obtain high performance in the task of answer sentence selection in factoid QA. In this paper, we design state-of-the-art models for non-factoid QA also carried out on noisy data. In particular, we study and compare models for comment selection in a community QA (cQA) scenario, where the majority of questions regard descriptions or explanations. To deal with such complex task, we incorporate relational information holding between questions and comments as well as domain-specific features into both convolutional models above.\n Our experiments on a cQA corpus show that both CTK and CNN achieve the state of the art, also according to a direct comparison with the results obtained by the best systems of the SemEval cQA challenge.","inCitations":["8519097e35e16bfcddd686d551daf08106627d0c","fd26f8069cfa528463fdf8a90864587e997ee86d","0f67b720a20dfa0608e4f6907925367f592cf1f9","768a706fcf632531495c1335eb6c02eb08980b43","b8ad1c73ef41d2f16f4301af8ceec92e0a3c276e","c90851f7bf0c4a54073a4155642622965e6fdb93","045596bd75c301cacde434b9fb54c1c9bbd81c4f"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning to Rank Non-Factoid Answers: Comment Selection in Web Forums","journalPages":"2049-2052","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983906"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Convolution","Convolutional neural network","Corpus linguistics","Display resolution","Experiment","Feature engineering","Learning to rank","Machine learning","Question answering","SemEval","Signal-to-noise ratio","Software quality assurance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ab6a6f4f7dff3c24b498b43a55213ed27458cf21","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","f5016081c97c8a46aa8b1149c6c364d8e5219408","da2cc9087ab1073e4b1251ef0f811921c101f4f5","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","735786a00d50373434d50f8c82889abbcdc8ea12","e5d9bd94a65f3ed497a4d36e089b1393b0e5520d","2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","4004723796a1c51401cdd7feb8c8692b523e7870","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","8e04c039a2ab5ea8bcb4029100b99c9764147dec","4aba54ea82bf99ed4690d45051f1b25d8b9554b5","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","3fab92869cfab684b3ffb1c16a771e9c3b774acd","03ff3f8f4d5a700fbe8f3a3e63a39523c29bb60f","25ac694fa23f733679496a139e9168472e267865","a62b58c267fddfa06545a7fc63a3c62ef7dc9e15","3aedcbf018d0320283c33d087bce7d71c527f5f8","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","4b15a006fa1a15be9cbadeb0558ef76fff52685c"],"id":"071961fc3d61b893c12f07abfa2906859152e3a9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/071961fc3d61b893c12f07abfa2906859152e3a9","authors":[{"name":"Kateryna Tymoshenko","ids":["2138659"]},{"name":"Daniele Bonadiman","ids":["3457102"]},{"name":"Alessandro Moschitti","ids":["1719404"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983906"}

In this sense, many studies point to the strong influence of socioeconomical factors in school performance but it is a challenge to select proper data to perform analyses on this matter. In tandem, it has happening a growth in provision of big quantities of educational indicators data, but in isolate cases, and by different agencies of Brazilian government. For this work, we use both education and economic indicators for analysis. The following socioeconomical indicators were selected: municipal human development index (MHDI), social vulnerability index (SVI), Gini coefficient and variables extracted from DBpedia, as part of the connection of this data to the Web of data: GDP per capita and municipal population. These data were used as independent variables to look into their correlations with Brazilian Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) performances at municipal level, supported by the application of linked open data principles. OpenRefine was used to extract the data from different sources, convert to RDF triples and then the mapping of the variables to existing ontologies and vocabularies in this domain, aiming at the reuse of existing semantics. The correlational analysis of the variables showed coherence with the literature about the theme, with significative magnitude between IDEB performances and the indicators related to income and parent education (SVI and HDI), besides moderate relations with the other varibles, except for the municipal population. Finally, the consolidated dataset, enriched by information extracted DBpedia was made available by a SPARQL endpoint for queries of humans and software agents, allowing other applications and researchers to explore the data from other platforms.","inCitations":["f3800859bc3f24b48d1427a76bcd932247759120","7effeb25a0a9c7b6fe4bd39610baab657a1f8642"],"pmid":"","title":"Correlational Analysis Between School Performance and Municipal Indicators in Brazil Supported by Linked Open Data","journalPages":"507-512","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ae79/06dd11640e4ad38e9c46ecf0f280de821db6.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2890459","http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p507.pdf"],"entities":["Coefficient","Communication endpoint","DBpedia","Linked data","Ontology (information science)","Performance","SPARQL","Software agent","Vocabulary","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8d029ca3dc002cdce23fbf4fa1918d31d38f727c","86654809d33b291a76895513ec82227c76d12df4","cdb578f1e6c5caf340eb214607c7b4cc391c6dfe"],"id":"ae7906dd11640e4ad38e9c46ecf0f280de821db6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ae7906dd11640e4ad38e9c46ecf0f280de821db6","authors":[{"name":"Bruno Elias Penteado","ids":["3066090"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2890459"}

In this paper, we examine the repeatability, reproducibility, and generalizability of TAGME, one of the most popular entity linking systems. By comparing results obtained from its public API with (re)implementations from scratch, we obtain the following findings. The results reported in the TAGME paper cannot be repeated due to the unavailability of data sources. Part of the results are reproducible through the provided API, while the rest are not reproducible. We further show that the TAGME approach is generalizable to the task of entity linking in queries. Finally, we provide insights gained during this process and formulate lessons learned to inform future reducibility efforts.","inCitations":["37f54ef89c0744dba373397a34c07e6e4b9e852f","77908e0588a18c3b8bb04ab10c8726cad5363434","a0bcae2595c2ab9a6cd935362450de9c531fab37","c5216c9a4bc00fa9705b1827bfd54c5abd1f5a5e","beb126da785608cd531c4d178c1b56f7b68fa0b1","0989a1ef1b3e9e663aafb994d0f6641dd5947b20","c3fe330480f2558c79e71a9cf3d78264143de56a","fd87f5f2bc93a44dda03cc73c976b09fbd73b2d0","4988a269e9f61c6fd1da502e34648b93dfd1a54d","5732c9f4500668d4186d50596b5681b4776b6b60","01215c2dacf8abb0bfa2e7fa868863b80069cc87","5450b29dd83a382bc4ac7a575015cdd775e49572"],"pmid":"","title":"On the Reproducibility of the TAGME Entity Linking System","journalPages":"436-449","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3718/8110036d4b88aabc870b9c4199489e519b1b.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://hasibi.com/files/ecir2016-tagme.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_32"],"entities":["Application programming interface","Entity linking","Repeatability","Unavailability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["05a0ee066fac4aebd37d7dd7f0cbce6d05951693","110f729addefa9de072e80cbcf68e034ed3c0116","b43b4f1034ad0e1924412d6c94d655e338ce289c","12f7b71324ee8e1796a9ef07af05b66674fe6af0","837b071d4c83e0f90d3e6b6edc1a2d4ca35711fb","0b9dea9414a3acbd5d00e00541f917f96be68e19","0228df9f05b4a9fb428c4868d69a5546560acd92","08b4efb97d98f4e66d8872899661f31ea58664da","1ccf386465081b6f8cad5a753827de7576dfe436","a99d85e6ff4e018507b6900c1849d94f15e5cf5e","1c909ac1c331c0c246a88da047cbdcca9ec9b7e7","2f9035a5dad6ad989b370d5f347cdac359539db3","10edc125d8e2685d5650034626d3ad4da8129de0","93cbd1f313dad71b355a9743fba64182e63c3b81","bb374cfb67aa44d467faadbe957975cd53255862","96c697be387566a0637941fc7492fcfc25ad56bb","5a30ad418890e57dfd21a6bfc495863695af2343","07abd02f02774d178f26ca99937e5f94001a9ec9"],"id":"37188110036d4b88aabc870b9c4199489e519b1b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/37188110036d4b88aabc870b9c4199489e519b1b","authors":[{"name":"Faegheh Hasibi","ids":["1951737"]},{"name":"Krisztian Balog","ids":["1680484"]},{"name":"Svein Erik Bratsberg","ids":["2895191"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_32"}

Individual performance of advertisers is usually expressed through observed click through rate, which depends on advertiser reputation, ad relevance and position. However, advertiser reputation has not been explicitly modeled in click prediction literature. Using traditional approaches in web page popularity for organic search in this context is not reasonable as the notion of link-structure in web is not directly applicable to sponsored search. In this study, we motivate and propose a pairwise preference relation model to study the advertiser reputation problem. Pairwise comparisons of advertisers give information over and above the information available in their individual historical performances. We relate the notion of preference among the advertisers to the spectral properties of the preference graph. We provide empirical evidence of the existence of reputation bias in click behavior. Consequently, we experiment with this signal to improve click prediction.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Preference Approach to Reputation in Sponsored Search","journalPages":"2041-2044","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983904"],"entities":["Organic search","Performance","Protein structure prediction","Relevance","Reputation management","Search engine marketing","Web page"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3a5066bcd59f81228876b6bf7d5410c63a82f173","0295bf6a59e5c585db427ad4b5fd55e9c13203f6","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","3d84550a70267edffa5694343e0e5c14c6afe608","505253630ab7e8f35e26e27904bd3c8faea3c5ce","3baecc04e1341cbae7999e8f61a3946c76504828","4eac2acf8fd14cb63378b271e0bb0a840e012aed","410ea896ea12e5856ed38f85246783d99729660a","1ff88585ce3fd5fdaab6573722d4874641359951","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","0937a009a56572943c1b20186fe8e292fd1eac38","0dba054f41c8cd3ef761a4dd2b8bb99dc5435ce1"],"id":"81f23b915251b3c5bf2bae6de0e3dfb7665890b0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/81f23b915251b3c5bf2bae6de0e3dfb7665890b0","authors":[{"name":"Aritra Ghosh","ids":["3201314"]},{"name":"Dinesh Gaurav","ids":["8291753"]},{"name":"Rahul Agrawal","ids":["33978635"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983904"}

However, it has so far failed to do the same for payments. Instead of finding the cheapest route for each payment from a competitive network of providers, we rely on a small number of proprietary operators with global reach. The work happening at the Web Payments Working Group at W3C is attempting to remove some of the friction in performing payments on the Web by defining a standard payment API and messaging in browsers. This will make payments on the Web easier but not entirely frictionless or integrated. As active participants in the W3C\u2019s Web Payments Working Group we present a browser polyfill[7] of one of the prosed payment APIs and will walk the audience through the goals of the WG and vision of how payments will work on the Web in the future. Building on this, we will introduce the Interledger Protocol (ILP), a new neutral payments protocol being incubated in the Interledger Payments Community Group, also at the W3C. We will demonstrate how, in the future, the combination of the W3C\u2019s Web Payments APIs and the power of ILP payments will not only be frictionless but fully integrated into how we use the Web.

As a result, most language editions contain only a small fraction of the sum of information that exists across all Wikipedias. In this paper, we present an approach to filling gaps in article coverage across different Wikipedia editions. Our main contribution is an end-to-end system for recommending articles for creation that exist in one language but are missing in another. The system involves identifying missing articles, ranking the missing articles according to their importance, and recommending important missing articles to editors based on their interests. We empirically validate our models in a controlled experiment involving 12,000 French Wikipedia editors. We find that personalizing recommendations increases editor engagement by a factor of two. Moreover, recommending articles increases their chance of being created by a factor of 3.2. Finally, articles created as a result of our recommendations are of comparable quality to organically created articles. Overall, our system leads to more engaged editors and faster growth of Wikipedia with no effect on its quality.","inCitations":["ed5645fed0abeb86c84ca5f610273a9b5849d337","fc417f9bdd5cbbd39a39be82ac9ee4ca12093202","2a5c9141b4a4ec7699a9fa481c275c3fb05be7c7","e8c8555ec9acd967c2cf6d4363ba82a98161cfc4","b8ecb40fa55095f530cc5ff173103584b02b9a89","31fd5cfab170e3c78aea64d651fb32e29777f15f","20a97eb697f44a5b32413d314d4324e69befd89d","0c16c4e40af84f99f6d9fa8dd7b17c2a54a24832","e898fa9e6ac4106bceb9154dbb160b7eac490e56","77e373087f3642feee88faa716beff4f9482d84e","e328414c04d5f715366b72a0e5c5381113db7b44","a1b33648c865a38579d773c629cda10f9ee1d054"],"pmid":"27819073v1","title":"Growing Wikipedia Across Languages via Recommendation","journalPages":"\n          975-985\n        ","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/eb87/2c9b7d56713ba84c5407373d5b6407442ca1.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28381338","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03235v1.pdf","https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/growing-www16.pdf","http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/growing-www16.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03235","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03235v1.pdf","http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/proceedings/p975.pdf","http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/growing-www16.pdf"],"entities":["End system","End-to-end principle","Programming Languages","Wikipedia","edition","interest"],"journalVolume":"2016","outCitations":["a2ee380e15c1f42d69cceec9dfc40c22113aae29","3cf477fcc4e9ba59fedd7fb02c54f54efc35ccef","6049d1e5db61afad835f10be445cf08d91f0dd76","13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986","1be16d8c557b15cdf2db9e7eb4453f2274fd60af","5b4fe3d08b91c8ec8fcd97cfbe2657c10248f769","6810ec5164a66a63b6ccbf474861349401910da0","621c6eb4108031bceaedeb9fe492393a06958c23","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","7bede7efe1560be5afc740efc7d4ae2ab99d6478","8cf39ea9233bf72577d54af0845711288c4118fd","f32b93e9918d7f8474e284b30ade37eaec97f416","83a6cacc126d85c45605797406262677c256a6af","28d0941f9f45e52c483c86cdc804968399cbb09e"],"id":"46fe4a571440a79305c87b77df357e2a163eee24","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/46fe4a571440a79305c87b77df357e2a163eee24","authors":[{"name":"Ellery Wulczyn","ids":["2618745"]},{"name":"Robert West","ids":["46379321"]},{"name":"Leila Zia","ids":["2538277"]},{"name":"Jure Leskovec","ids":["1702139"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872427.2883077"}

This trend is fueled on the one hand by the adoption of the Linked Data principles by a growing number of data providers. On the other hand, large numbers of websites have started to semantically mark up the content of their HTML pages and thus also contribute to the wealth of structured data available on the Web.

Understanding how the users search to learn is essential for making search engines support these learning-related searches more effectively.

We also set up a preliminary research framework, design the experiment protocol of the user study, and discuss about the limitations of this study and the potential implications for improving Web search engines.","inCitations":["9ee257a6d7c221ae82e0d2dffafca8f733a913d9"],"pmid":"","title":"How does Domain Expertise Affect Users' Search Processes in Exploratory Searches?","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b999/c3eb4efde6bd1e6b50d2d71107cf14c7292f.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1647/SAL2016_paper_20.pdf"],"entities":["Categorization","Dichotomic search","Exploratory testing","Faceted classification","Nonlinear gameplay","Usability testing","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9fb9fe4893437fd9c6171a7ecb7d4525bf5706a1","6f4d878378eda3529a7ddbe4d3c16b3b4c826353","f6f8d09cd9d6d11d30f828d170efc143861f4560","8e6d963a9c1115de61e7672c6d4c54c781b3e54d","0638be89d6057afa8585d9b7c6900548acbe5b2f","2c92e8f93be31eb7d82f21b64e5b72fec735c169","edfa3337e9b0d569562d49ad2b522adb835f567d","19c87fd2b04438562959e2bdc488dedcb6aff21f","616f76790ce314ef6c509b486f386b5c4e1e9384","1413a53ecf6950817b5e92d542e536ca418f342f","4047d5efd1683bbd3280500c3244149089412024","ed4cbb28e02b3520252fe8089374deffc15800a6","ca12a4beb8c8c076f9bcdb23525c31b18bb21ec7"],"id":"b999c3eb4efde6bd1e6b50d2d71107cf14c7292f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b999c3eb4efde6bd1e6b50d2d71107cf14c7292f","authors":[{"name":"Jiaxin Mao","ids":["3340223"]},{"name":"Yiqun Liu","ids":["1783406"]},{"name":"Min Zhang","ids":["38898636"]},{"name":"Shaoping Ma","ids":["8093158"]}],"doi":""}

Proper usage of quote can usually make the statement more elegant and convincing. However, the ability of quote usage is usually limited by the amount of quotes one remembers or knows. Quote recommendation is a task of exploiting abundant quote repositories to help people make better use of quotes while writing. The task is different from conventional recommendation tasks due to the characteristic of quote. A pilot study has explored this task by using a learning to rank framework and manually designed features. However, it is still hard to model the meaning of a quote, which is an interesting and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a neural network approach based on LSTMs to the quote recommendation task. We directly learn the distributed meaning representations for the contexts and the quotes, and then measure the relevance based on the meaning representations. In particular, we try to represent the words in quotes with specific embeddings, according to the contexts, topics and even author preferences of the quotes. Experimental results on a large dataset show that our proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance and it outperforms several strong baselines.","inCitations":["302b292d895da562b201d22d55c5764c981a992d","fd6c208591ff45dbf3167f65ad6371bf2e37bcbc","a6297520c05cc80d60786f9380ceae82fa4de856","6a23c20b32d092e978751c038873df7e620c4646","081ad92ce0e71541646218f11061c86414a960c2","30782b41e79c26ddadf8576402bd488885dd120c"],"pmid":"","title":"A Neural Network Approach to Quote Recommendation in Writings","journalPages":"65-74","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983788"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Learning to rank","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["851332942f7cfbd74e3f2799309c1383fa547fb6","05aba481e8a221df5d8775a3bb749001e7f2525e","529abf1f5d7d8d937801f3542fcc616d79bd55d0","22ae02d81c21cb90b0de071550cfb99e6a623e62","d3bbd57899d938e8c4bcafbbda10ceb59638e4db","b44ff5104557fc9b900d48f02605dd42d794927d","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","ce29db10680a9f29413319561f21134557907b9b","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","935bb1c862d35599b902d566999ff6ce9fa5320e","03ff3f8f4d5a700fbe8f3a3e63a39523c29bb60f","04d77c31c62c9afb89dac7107f4a6390bc9ee601","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","7cc382e31f9b263892c7f66023ec441dd1df321d","1deb57a6eb406ef1e15df7c74ee49123262a931e","3a2e446a037240fac23c94bf6a6066e489138a12","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","468b9055950c428b17f0bf2ff63fe48a6cb6c998","3d376896a9aa01a71455880e033a27633d88bd6d","1682b8b395c7d7fa30b3cec961ac81fdda53e72d","091931a01327acbe441be1a2c9f3ae8ba55aea60","0788fb1109b1db8c72776005c9c0af926a278017","167abf2c9eda9ce21907fcc188d2e41da37d9f0b","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","652d159bf64a70194127722d19841daa99a69b64","052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","c81d2f308b80f8a008d329a22b63dc09503ae045","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","fc981c140ae0331b5ea20f48cb92762d8e8316b9"],"id":"432dfc7430a0c2b48b713830982917a0df1fdf90","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/432dfc7430a0c2b48b713830982917a0df1fdf90","authors":[{"name":"Jiwei Tan","ids":["2796928"]},{"name":"Xiaojun Wan","ids":["1773254"]},{"name":"Jianguo Xiao","ids":["2888671"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983788"}

It was the first widely seen demonstration of cognitive computing, and it marked the end of the so-called\u201cAI winter.\u201dWatson\u2019s ability to answer subtle, complex, pun-laden questions made clear that a new era of computing was at hand. An era where computers can start making sense of the vast amount of unstructured data in the world and apply this understanding not only to answer trivia questions, but also to tackle some of the world\u2019s pressing problems and change how people interact with computers. Indeed, since Jeopardy!, Watson has tackled increasingly complex data sets, and developed understanding, reasoning, and learning. Specifically, we have identified five core capabilities of Cognitive Computing: 1. They create deeper human engagement; 2. They scale and elevate expertise; 3. They infuse products and services with cognition; 4. They enable cognitive processes and operations; 5. They enhance exploration and discovery. The true potential of the Cognitive Era will be realized by combining the data analytics, and statistical reasoning of machines with uniquely human qualities, such as self-directed goals, common sense, and ethical values. This is what Watson was built to do, and is in fact already doing. Banks are analyzing customer requests and financial data to surface insights to help them make investment recommendations. Companies in heavily regulated industries are querying the system to keep up with ever-changing legislation and standards of compliance. And oncologists are testing ways in which cognitive systems can help interpret cancer patients\u2019 clinical information and identify individualized, evidence-based treatment options that leverage specialists\u2019 experience and research. Customer and technical support are in particular being re-invented, relying more on cognitive systems for self-help and for agent assist.

These are large-scale experiments that involve research subjects often numbering in the hundreds of thousands and wide-ranging, computer-automated variations in experimental treatment. In some cases, the results of online experiments may be of use internally to optimize system performance (for example, a test may be conducted to help make web page layout decisions). In other cases, the results may be of academic interest (for example, an experiment may be conducted to test a hypothesis about human behavior). Because of their rapid deployment and broad impact, online experimentation systems provide an extremely valuable tool for scientists and engineers. Despite this statistical power, in some situations, an online experiment can raise difficult ethical questions. One only needs to revisit the conversations resulting from the Facebook emotional contagion experiment to understand that some experiments may, at the very least, warrant careful review before being conducted. Since this episode, scholarship published mainly in the qualitative research and information law communities indicates that this may not be an isolated incident. Ethical and legal problems probably arise in other online experiments, published or not. As experimentation platforms and users become easily accessible, scientists and practitioners may increasingly put the well-being and trust of end users at risk. In light of these concerns, organizations often review online experiments before they are actually conducted. In production settings, the review process might vary with respect to formality or standards across companies and even groups within companies. When intended or used for academic publication, experiments or data may have undergone inconsistent review processes, some implementing academic-style institutional review boards and others none at all.

However, with today's online and mobile technologies, bullying is moving beyond the schoolyards via cell phones, social networks, online text, video and images, etc. As bad as fighting and bullying were before the advent of the mobile Internet, the recording and posting of hurtful content online has magnified the harmful reach of bullying, enabling 24/7 bullying. Although cyberbullying may not cause any physical damage initially, it has potentially devastating psychological effects like depression, low self-esteem, suicide ideation, and even suicide. Given the gravity of the consequences cyberbullying has on its victims and its rapid spread among middle and high school students, there is an immediate and pressing need for research to understand how cyber-bullying occurs in OSNs today, so that effective techniques can be developed to accurately detect cyberbullying. Most of the previous research on cyberbullying focused on the psychological component of cyberbullying. Only recently have researchers begun to explore computational methods for detecting cyberbullying. This survey provides insight into the problem of cyberbullying in social networks by investigating existing methods in the research literature. We will first review various computational approaches in analysis, detection and prediction of cyberbullying, harassment and aggressive behavior. Then we discuss the key technical limitations and challenges researchers are facing in this field.","inCitations":["7e4676c4f2d3643c74ca642651f783917a543e06","beb0e2682cb0ac132dc348044d1940669fb7194a"],"pmid":"","title":"Survey of Computational Methods in Cyberbullying Research","journalPages":"4","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3002137.3002140"],"entities":["Computation","Cyberbullying","Internet","Mobile phone","Scientific literature","Sensor","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"7f9898835df4ba048919932aec884d05ed2bfc5d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7f9898835df4ba048919932aec884d05ed2bfc5d","authors":[{"name":"Homa Hosseinmardi","ids":["2378569"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3002137.3002140"}

For many types of records, especially those involving images, such a task can be difficult for machines, but relatively easy for humans. Typical crowd-based ER approaches ask workers for pairwise judgments between records, which quickly becomes prohibitively expensive even for moderate numbers of records. In this paper, we reduce the cost of pairwise crowd ER approaches by soliciting the crowd for attribute labels on records, and then asking for pairwise judgments only between records with similar sets of attribute labels. However, due to errors induced by crowd-based attribute labeling, a naive attribute-based approach becomes extremely inaccurate even with few attributes. To combat these errors, we use error mitigation strategies which allow us to control the accuracy of our results while maintaining significant cost reductions. We develop a probabilistic model which allows us to determine the optimal, lowest-cost combination of error mitigation strategies needed to achieve a minimum desired accuracy. We test our approach with actual crowdworkers on a dataset of celebrity images, and find that our results yield crowd ER strategies which achieve high accuracy yet are significantly lower cost than pairwise-only approaches.","inCitations":["09dcfd29a20858cc11866778afdf53da4cb6459b","6e02f36239b77df32512de331d037afd9bfbdb82","98a565719d39426e9c47e8a07032498502f9d49a","aabe9a4aaf9037e8f864a93995f31d1d92716d57"],"pmid":"","title":"Attribute-based Crowd Entity Resolution","journalPages":"549-558","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/1147/1/AttributeBasedCrowdER_CIKM05162016_cameraready.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983831"],"entities":["Image","Statistical model","Use error"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["422d9b1a05bc33fcca4b9aa9381f46804c6132fd","f5d9c0182d8578f7c0a99ad9bdd4ff62e5f7c68d","121822b16a8b33378929b52506e24ec92cf74f8f","737d7cbf3d03442f5403abb0c6d43a9ec4cd1f7e","3b2697d76f035304bfeb57f6a682224c87645065","79c975638c87d8dcd34d705ef7ffc3acc81c4da3","0a55adc5741b0dc0d2727ca3f7aa88e11cedcd13","1c799eca7983c62f7815ac5f41787b3e552567b6","2e9419adbe5df860e0cc260b0bf30236b356c105","2fa2af72590819d7a4be995baa9809060f9c815a","06be6eb9585d070c979f89ae19fe84fe4ab355a1","289fa221f73c1740df420769d9ad6ac05e7008c9","88cd4becf3587a8378e450a99ded801fbdb264e1","96b8bf94ce88754458e8d23fd24782e72871d93b","08f51a9138458f667f0c00d40b6a820c451c7d36","20d90871bc0dc7956bf2557d91d8d96deb0a4520","5344003d021e666db2972d5435f4e422acf20c2b","45c0b91d24cbdf0eae15f53ff75a11b3a696ed74","060bdc422872e375bbef9b1cd82fbf0f936d4691","151673abe01271dc3fc37725c02e95e7970f3bed","0870c676e5c6a7932a73b7a9f38183ed03193b2c","71b76a4de9b1364be2905278b69e0912c5f70b3a","a32e396a5d5e5b626265e028d5b91d30922d5529","0bace9cf0547417dde5fbca991658241d3c6ef57","22f516acc61967369ec29d4121c7b517d5f60e08"],"id":"83b5d51ab2f0c526dbe640f3b3d9b3b257658dc8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83b5d51ab2f0c526dbe640f3b3d9b3b257658dc8","authors":[{"name":"Asif R.

Traditional methods only depend on the single source data (e.g., taxi trajectories) to design blackhole detection algorithm from one point of view, which is rather incomplete to describe the regional crowd flow. In this paper, we model the urban black holes in each region of New York City (NYC) at different time intervals with a 3-dimensional tensor by fusing cross-domain data sources. Supplementing the missing entries of the tensor through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we leverage the knowledge from geographical features, 311 complaint features and human mobility features to recover the blackhole situation throughout NYC. The information can facilitate local residents and officials' decision making. We evaluate our model with five datasets related to NYC, diagnosing the urban black holes that cannot be identified (or earlier than those detected) by a single dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages beyond four baseline methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Context-aware Collaborative Filtering Approach for Urban Black Holes Detection","journalPages":"2137-2142","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983655"],"entities":["Algorithm","Anomaly detection","Baseline (configuration management)","Black Hole","Catastrophic interference","Collaborative filtering","Single-source data","Source data","The New York Times"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c30f5f1d90e4c26786d8956269340dd743095115","1b1209777b30d4b97e2f99355ec6394e3658d9ba","5cad03354fcf2a8d3887506d748277935e7ee09f","1d0f25989452abbbc8feaf00a034ff110fc4b350","046bf6fb90438335eaee07594855efbf541a8aba","83684a662282c747738faaf67f2b7782e8cabbbe","03329fbf411b3de57c349a341b52b974fc9021f7","0fb5805546d159a1bc425366b3d4d7b16b77872a","51084ccb5eb2b2d9ad41fd91a76ed12f8b892397","e1efb6053e784dd874189f254a17f5d0ccb8b97b","c856c11300e9e682ca26a0bb8fe1fb6907092c1f","5c2ac947d3df82dbf2348246ff6b102cb2585443","bc766374653168623cc5c1c12f31978549bf5e6d","a6bff7b89af697508d23353148530ea43c6c36e1","065cf0031a2a9f72d587165306c82ebd9e41dbbc","2a841a61aa2b041dc71940333698d8905234be4b","aa75bf416be6125d1e8c71642c3a72233184cb2d","aae986112d3b29cd26e290734c9165b395e9afe5"],"id":"bde40c638fd03b685114d8854de2349969f2e091","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bde40c638fd03b685114d8854de2349969f2e091","authors":[{"name":"Li Jin","ids":["37808866"]},{"name":"Zhuonan Feng","ids":["2627518"]},{"name":"Ling Feng","ids":["1750982"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983655"}

To support queries across content modalities, the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing. While hashing methods have shown great potential in achieving this goal, current attempts generally fail to learn isomorphic hash codes in a seamless scheme, that is, they embed multiple modalities in a continuous isomorphic space and separately threshold embeddings into binary codes, which incurs substantial loss of retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically, CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space, and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors, which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time. A comprehensive set of experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CCQ against the state of the art hashing methods for both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval.","inCitations":["6b24792298d47409cdf23012f593d49e2be0d4f3","f43012db4836cf671a2a095413ba5ec6725e4a41","d2421808cfeb7e563bf55952c00bad68d2658cfd","b89574cad348c8c17ae9c650d912b3ac18c24ac3","cba96182e8b1848509d9af0426f6abdb59ae099c","a259dbd49f7cb634a1353c4b6783357a9904f7e6","77dc67a13e533d58029f073aa9735ab94253849e","dedcb5a3cbc3d17553683cf422789aaf0785f60f","5ac70f184dc9766f94e704c149a2d4a6f1635093","f632790471b2bed7ba7c28b12cda9360ec586a63","bf0c632fd2aa24c92ceb2625346c89497d478df2","c65edd9bb3c300c8bf3e93981c51054642db08a4","7d3e6afc5331834f8a77a7e898351e9de52859b9","523419ec5174536586f38c796cff94ac333ef53b","9018d664a9b3909cfad55b1618a7b8fece5cb3e1","69d2dc30472ab94b9e2015b7b4c2e9b4c976f836","fd9070ca4aa06434be03c66deb153cb4d0e5ea72","12d1c3e20456feae5b74536b1cf370005c0ea9d1","1c9312acd39d2fe7fd4b8bfa03337a88ec08fd96","3f933e375edc483a525fa005130a0515f025e985","74baecfb6292271045eb744b46f33b680145cc81","4906d2c1723669219b38116efd418664f682450a","07cbf1f60147fa3196332bc314108fec7d316318","eab4e06148237e66647addd82f75a2ca0b9e215c","abb831ee29f712da542d8f754d4574a87142e3d7","868de519de2adeae9a0ec909d12a79e5cecaa05c","eb55b90aceefeb5745aaa2b146e1effec5d1270a"],"pmid":"","title":"Composite Correlation Quantization for Efficient Multimodal Retrieval","journalPages":"579-588","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.04818v2.pdf","http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/doc/composite-correlation-quantization-sigir16.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911493","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.04818v2.pdf"],"entities":["Binary code","Codebook","Computation","Deep learning","ENCODE","Experiment","Feature vector","Hash function","Latent semantic analysis","Mathematical optimization","Maximal set","Modal logic","Multimodal interaction","Nonlinear system","Pervasive informatics","Seamless3d","Social network","Time complexity","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a9cfe45196f8d88a9fbc23a5799656ad67593edf","3080d3e1e6e4e47a839ee4f3849eeb8233c2eb18","03f3a4a40644258628f2361d848a3bb28b42c1ae","1944fda0d2aad86fdfac5f3c0d5c3b4055fa1336","0d0cee830772c3b2b274bfb5c3ad0ee42d8a0a57","c24495b0c14bf6b563e4b8c9656a4072d6f83995","4748d22348e72e6e06c2476486afddbc76e5eca7","226bab70ecb9e13ef8fdb503a6183615d5c898ed","385b401bf75771b02b5721641ae04ace43d2bbcd","13edf531cf6367c6a994f9a2b3e527f438433cdb","47865b56fee61d9c9ff477f7c79f090cc6663d3a","b7b00080f83e5b65a10bb07c0a7091e746c3a57e","69ec8f0d28eb0cd894af7a5bff81a711c726caa1","8087f878039728a766167b42cc1ea40190dc7fe2","030b67c850dde82ba96514744afd890f0833c01c","5665d6ef693632de35406580d536fe05ed5c2db1","cc83e27cec14e2fccde7d685d36321885df8e8b0","50d6de8dd8f30d34a2c13cc9d3d203d4a978e543","2b726b240fb75e459eacc8a6916a26a93373088f","aab4d69fa53fbbadc072c68b74856d58eaafe511","1379ad7fe27fa07419b7f6956af754bdb6d49558","570689c91d8f663458319a53e4a48759e10263e9","3bde75072df0233b7d8e690eb413b152107f7289","2a869bc7c1488023c6e791e9c9071badfbad749d","7b3f39094a99d037c989ec0a9702f0dd05898d2a","9ca7db8c6ca82fe6436a806fc9b35e5aaa6df02f","37586efdc0d56b1179aee3059bc18c84483e3bb9","0b48fa53d15aebd66a3ea54d2d3cc29c0b4bde96","1d1ed3ee382434cbad4323d539a47dc46f1ee913","339db82712834ee2698c71f481dcf775fbca0d12","0d30860edf7dd5362436e6fd5262c618e33573d5","30a1f82da02441d099bf15ca026751fcd76c8dee","e17529924798975856310a75cb3df3066ac7ccfa"],"id":"6bfd210f319de8aa934097e8a6a0d008ce878bfa","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6bfd210f319de8aa934097e8a6a0d008ce878bfa","authors":[{"name":"Mingsheng Long","ids":["35776445"]},{"name":"Yue Cao","ids":["1696087"]},{"name":"Jianmin Wang","ids":["1751179"]},{"name":"Philip S.

Techniques for identifying and normalizing explicit temporal expressions work well, but are not designed for and cannot cope with textual phrases that denote named events, such as \u201cClinton\u2019s term as secretary of state\u201d. This paper addresses the problem of detecting such temponyms, inferring their temporal scopes, and mapping them to events in a knowledge base if present there. We present methods for this kind of temponym resolution, using an entityand TempEx-oriented document model and the Yago knowledge base for distant supervision. We develop a family of Integer Linear Programs for jointly inferring temponym mappings to the timeline and knowledge base. This enriches the document representation and also extends the knowledge base by obtaining new alias names for events. Experiments with three different corpora demonstrate the viability of our methods.","inCitations":["38ba89cc61a0582b3fdf0f1bd6db4a3b8c53f9f1","772f69b1dd966610edaa4ef2576d36142dc05928","608eb7045f77868a1e219ef5fdf6d13d67d6ed3f","24d0b13f6daf0ec327beed4440d84ea5862383d7","07a9d9bf6af8eb5ac734735b8c2ce4c3de095131","4196a5edff2f9a7511b7173b21edb4a6e72d921f","3a6a0306139155b080bea9a0dd20a287280e45df","0ca6bf02b2a6fa30c8e9970725426a08d077bb47","6d0c0649d51f0245cef1de9d5f27012a1a27d958","16e0488c75bdd9c36450bb9e1c76b6d482500fe4","50d6ab4eb0facf0b87b162ee7515604417a2f857","836003bdb98189a3a56a387439da322df8732c0e"],"pmid":"","title":"As Time Goes By: Comprehensive Tagging of Textual Phrases with Temporal Scopes","journalPages":"915-925","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3910/1b6482e21eccbd77f2dee6a3710037e4ba6f.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883055","http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/d5/evin/publications/WWW16.pdf"],"entities":["Information extraction","Knowledge base","Linear programming","Question answering","Sensor","Temporal expressions","Text corpus","Timeline","YAGO"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6b9a0429c2e6b9fe36c0b6e8874e37d402a647c1","10b6b9d3a898068de54d69590a38940dbfd039e2","280f9cc6ee7679d02a7b8b58d08173628057f3ea","9b9744c03d85c4e1c89c8151834992cb08b9515b","3f048ae469df3e5cc9719067c9ffb0a8fe02cc70","1a6d7544405b3e6de7171b30d90ebaa670780475","b74dc11004d7f8c34036d2572e1a79369ead36b3","079af7295a47097ed1e7da00a7f518684a4add89","4f4d5503a2a069e36c92f08bafcb444dd9493b86","5c73844451f0d0dd512c435f0c91ef62c8017502","12dbbc1f31d302b528e7d260b6a51fb280112ab3","72457597317af0380d24538b69c81fb7d9ce3f06","98b763c35cbe0e8f31e9cbaeaf2a6fa27ee33888","64596abdf95560ac4be87c71424d011eb1e51f78","38ba6e8e077186e84e39376e1cdf3e7382a63282","54ec45b27438fe816c20a2e46e92a62939644c8a","1d8c3e6e6852140f781f7d848f89345c480971d9","4e6f8182de9dd04f1fe4f07425964ccf063a79bd","4f410ab5c8b12b34b38421241366ee456bbebab9","81f8706abcecfc748f2e27d6f7a92628036d6846","46e236549ae35011e45ca4f97d402508bd5995ff","02003e9b374d1d1699614f2ff8e234e74f3bc3a3","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","8bf4607632133727296575e50b9eb7bac0da2c5f","6c0cfbb0e02b8d5ea3f0d6f94eb25c7b93ff3e85","4ef5172c8f925c7e2dd7f8affb6f18e710d6608b","334b171a274ad5c0fe526895ed3edb230c451e7e","3a52425c8b268bb9750ee7d34b47527f893e71c6","1f1d4eb9d382e016e8fa68670a025d4fbb2b7622","0228df9f05b4a9fb428c4868d69a5546560acd92","3425dcafb9feb477325aa4983018741acb0d4369","34ca53baa03ed8855e534ea34cbd66103bf90af7","f48aea435a92304c1ce8bb66cef405486481b9d4","3965b1d15b2de806b758082ed86b41b01cb6728a","b162c99873c929447bb7ff48d454867aa83f375c","6679fe38ec224526ddaba7486564b7e579075e58","407314c1b491511564c089d26e7e92c0c93af754","7d0ab8168a24df38f7a2e897d1374c4d505979ed","0d9d8be5ee0c1cda47beafea0ef0b14722cbd908","39c230241d51b1435472115aaa8c62b94ab9927d","d8aca39a2113150811b63ff443f42ddac9a4935a"],"id":"39101b6482e21eccbd77f2dee6a3710037e4ba6f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/39101b6482e21eccbd77f2dee6a3710037e4ba6f","authors":[{"name":"Erdal Kuzey","ids":["2381256"]},{"name":"Vinay Setty","ids":["2852530"]},{"name":"Jannik Strötgen","ids":["2013656"]},{"name":"Gerhard Weikum","ids":["1751591"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872427.2883055"}

The most popular algorithms used for this purpose in the literature are based on the assumption that the relatively high occurrence frequencies of certain word segments described as recurrent partials in a lexicon suggests the existence of morpheme boundaries around such high frequency word segments. Even though this word-segment-frequency approach works well for concatenative morphology, it does not cater for some of the most productive morphological processes in Yorùbá and some other African languages. In this paper, unsupervised induction of the morphological rules of Yorùbá was achieved based on a wordpattern-frequency rather than a word-segment-frequency approach. Words in a Yorùbá lexicon were clustered according to the morphological processes on which their formation are based, producing results that hitherto were achievable only by painstaking rule-based manual classification.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Pattern-based Unsupervised Induction Of Yorùbá Morphology","journalPages":"599-604","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d0f8/2e450409e52f0b4ca049aea8f6afb65d5ee7.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2890563","http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p599.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Computation","Lexicon","Logic programming","Mathematical morphology","Morphological parsing","Unsupervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["bb1867d8e6593e4328431efa44b33dd4fe35bec9","55022b6104ab31ef655441f1670b902ecca2f361","5c2e8ef6835ca92476fa6d703e7cc8b1955f108f","6f0c72f25d413eb8cc2dfbda38afbeeae74e6f87","06dec3e8e2ea569db21d6a0346f19e8ed3a15d24","9af5c320f1ab4e881c1aa4e35d7c7f10d5d2405d","cb375ba31705cb2174a1815b9329f9ce38eefd37","83bee08ca267c0e7a20bf013704086765cd732a6"],"id":"d0f82e450409e52f0b4ca049aea8f6afb65d5ee7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d0f82e450409e52f0b4ca049aea8f6afb65d5ee7","authors":[{"name":"Tunde Adegbola","ids":["3099231"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2890563"}

Advantages of both modes are analyzed and it is shown that they are complementary, so a design based on coexistence is more appropriate for the final user than single modes.

Hence, in contrast to its data distribution, workflows and technologies for decentralized collaborative contribution are missing. In this paper we propose the Structured Feedback protocol as an interactive addition to the Web of Data. It offers support for users to contribute to the evolution of web resources, by providing structured data artifacts as patches for web resources, as well as simple plain text comments.

The main challenge in translating ontologies is to disambiguate an ontology label with respect to the domain modelled by ontology itself. Machine translation services may help in this task; however, a crucial requirement is to have translations validated by experts before the ontologies are deployed. For this reason, real-world applications must implement a support system addressing this task to relieve experts in validating all translations. In this paper we present the Expert Supporting System for Ontology Translation, called ESSOT, which exploits the semantic information of the label\u2019s context for improving the quality of label translations. The system has been tested within the Organic.Lingua project by translating the ontology labels in three languages. In order to evaluate further the effectiveness of the system on handling different domains, additional ontologies were translated and evaluated. The results have been compared with translations provided by the Microsoft Translator API and the improvements demonstrate a better performance of the proposed approach for automatic ontology translation.","inCitations":["ed3556201a4476dabd6d09e537942e984482417b","1a9d66ab00cbf139b5a1137ad9e84fb0a0c2ec43","fdfe30d9d683c2b4acd68a87fc14dadb8c304871","ac9e57635838d4020994abda405cb51f1913c6e2"],"pmid":"","title":"Translating Ontologies in Real-World Settings","journalPages":"241-256","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/18da/f1d956d9fea71e5f93e16b878a7198a4c876.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46547-0_25","https://www.insight-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/iswc2016otto_insight_0.pdf"],"entities":["Application programming interface","Bing Translator","Gene Ontology Term Enrichment","Knowledge management","Language industry","Machine translation","Ontology (information science)","Semantic translation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4ee2eab4c298c1824a9fb8799ad8eed21be38d21","8ff93cfd37dced279134c9d642337a2085b31f59","1de41a9fe8a390bc3984be0080fab10f6d01ee19","b94b6be54ccd10cca8d22322472065126875cef4","e986800e10967fa8e0ec213a8e72a68edde12be3","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","b2b628cc2cdbc2a244ca869dc2050a1f66edc275","65c747c7eca335baf3b43a1c6e8cc7a7decc42ee","6c2d2081b7a41957c3a86405cb445f1bd68a77a3","1725260cb028f3fda583822c9a44a547934b2a34","3c69d4c3d4202b5fc78dbc85962973383108c53c","6e964849b0f8334c0905d6ea8cac6beefbbd8939","4658a728225d2408a93c8706c2418dc4379d6be7","3d07b5087e53c6f7c228b3c7e769494527be228e","7ad19fa4baf1031aee118d0ffd00b2c031d60ccf","0443cbd87143744aa1d7eee2f0c478180f6d9f5c","694b3c58712deefb59502847ba1b52b192c413e5","62fe977b5e85113072482bdcd45756b7ce9c16bb","11e554e77feb9c5c1e2bf0683e47905e713b8da4","6fa78447ffca2de6a69fe4fb2e0dae8b179b8847","b20465439a26cfef4fad9c3819c735df7ad0a758","84eaeb4c265e1a297342bfcbe9169b4feeb75219","0e2795b1329b25ba3709584b96fd5cb4c96f6f22","713f0933fa8958f7d5a1404dcebaf0c963737430","26adb749fc5d80502a6d889966e50b31391560d3","c64d27b122d5b6ef0be135e63df05c3b24bd80c5","bcd6de970fb4b91262f3ced4abc05694a70aa751"],"id":"18daf1d956d9fea71e5f93e16b878a7198a4c876","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/18daf1d956d9fea71e5f93e16b878a7198a4c876","authors":[{"name":"Mihael Arcan","ids":["1951431"]},{"name":"Mauro Dragoni","ids":["2346796"]},{"name":"Paul Buitelaar","ids":["3338131"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-46547-0_25"}

An intention detection task tries to model and discover intentions that user encoded in text queries. Unlike conventional text classification tasks where the label of text is highly correlated with some topic-specific words, words from different topic categories tend to co-occur in medical related queries. Besides the existence of topic-specific words and word order, word correlations and the way words organized into sentence are crucial to intention detection tasks. In this paper, we present a neural network based jointly modeling approach to model and capture user intentions in medical related text queries. Regardless of the exact words in text queries, the proposed method incorporates two types of heterogeneous information: 1) pairwise word feature correlations and 2) part-of-speech tags of a sentence to jointly model user intentions. Variable-length text queries are first inherently taken care of by a fixed-size pairwise feature correlation matrix. Moreover, convolution and pooling operations are applied on feature correlations to fully exploit latent semantic structure within the query. Sentence rephrasing is finally introduced as a data augmentation technique to improve model generalization ability during model training. Experiment results on real world medical queries have shown that the proposed method is able to extract complete and precise user intentions from text queries.","inCitations":["2134deada3fcbc2a41a6680e9c173f05ff8b6edb","670e79e78457c5da12d54c44dea6f2be2f06bf52","dd29e5b9e6ab9396daa4cf545b4dfef4e64b6be4","0b335b47a6281cd03497d2c9b176ca96e41a6cad","a81fd9baf49822d00d73dfda537e7a15bf03dba0","daabf7fef114743c46523a719dd8bdadbdb2d86f","80c92fc69925dd47e95bef43a5feb8d040adb587","8cfa5158ad0e63a352c9418d208db5bb132896cc","076b14c1d818dca6612ad3716a6d4ef33be93974","a356420fecd0df431e724b4640e537c2af7114be"],"pmid":"","title":"Mining User Intentions from Medical Queries: A Neural Network Based Heterogeneous Jointly Modeling Approach","journalPages":"1373-1384","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2874810"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Care-of address","Convolution","Convolutional neural network","Document classification","Part-of-speech tagging"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["37b07566d53b8533c57d707c4913aae505a93a66","15f4b13502665404dd344390f9effdbcddb7d4aa","127316fbe268c78c519ceb23d41100e86639418a","87fe8163dcaff9b5cb759439c47c2c4661c78829","eba36ac75bf22edf9a1bfd33244d459c75b98305","086a4b57cda97981cb41c92b7a6b6628d8a51309","017ef3a1c388824bf9abb58766b95bc9947c4c9b","5436b501fe15e1a5c0554027b151422d106a336d","178286f3640f9c5c8c129799d6b00f313481d13a","162d958ff885f1462aeda91cd72582323fd6a1f4","22c19d97e560a3937f1625f63830c90bf125d359","62565909c930212b8236f519b8b0ac23df5c4a90","e4ce1f13102d5173f938921d0790de20501f3f06","7b1cc19dec9289c66e7ab45e80e8c42273509ab6","297e7d58820cb1c3a6084e570f990b4f77660a40","2e10643c3759f97b673ff8c297778c0b6c20032b","1a07186bc10592f0330655519ad91652125cd907","12c81bb90a11cfcbe7ec5af00fc50d7750c140c8","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","1a1647f8723fca094b15e25ab344e46a835b6aef","5bdd28ff6260dd9146be3533ed7376fa60720468","2116b2eaaece4af9c28c32af2728f3d49b792cf9","03ff3f8f4d5a700fbe8f3a3e63a39523c29bb60f","e769ee9aa184986e36ffab9248fd1e88db4be24a","8ecc044d920df247fbd455b752fd7cc0f7363ad7","6806588dfc2633c3cd86ab3faba2a44a8e4ceb63","364da079f91a6cb385997be990af06e9ddf6e888","2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","39cf55b9500a38b5b32f29cc7a9b8457a804f1b9","cfbecffd0691615025f19a92574e6aac658092c0","4b459775f86584c35d3bc2eb8b2cf7d8569052e2","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50"],"id":"8f528ecd3ac7825ce050285e41e1ab205951a9b8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f528ecd3ac7825ce050285e41e1ab205951a9b8","authors":[{"name":"Chenwei Zhang","ids":["2418496"]},{"name":"Wei Fan","ids":["46193609"]},{"name":"Nan Du","ids":["1714086"]},{"name":"Philip S.

As the amount of data increases, current solutions such as summary table and MapReduce-based methods struggle to respond to such queries with low latency. Other approaches such as segment tree based methods have a poor insertion performance when the data size exceeds the available memory. This paper proposes a new segment tree based index called PISA, which has fast insertion performance and low latency for aggregation queries. PISA uses a forest to overcome the performance disadvantages of insertions in traditional segment trees. By defining two kinds of tags, namely code number and serial number, we propose an algorithm to accelerate queries by avoiding reading unnecessary data on disk. The index is stored on disk and only takes a few hundred bytes of memory for billions of data points. PISA can be easily implemented on both traditional databases and NoSQL systems, examples including MySQL and Cassandra. It handles aggregation queries within milliseconds on a commodity server for a time range that may contain tens of billions of data points.","inCitations":["a3059dd6928afc3beaa8dd01c3091d31b607dde5"],"pmid":"","title":"PISA: An Index for Aggregating Big Time Series Data","journalPages":"979-988","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983775"],"entities":["Aggregate function","Algorithm","Apache Cassandra","Approximation algorithm","Byte","Commodity computing","Data point","Database","Experiment","MapReduce","Microsoft Windows","MySQL","NoSQL","Segment tree","Server (computing)","Sorting","Time series"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8859f4b7f3d826bcae4eff2735a073030be23e8a","09bbe8b36b9ff995260492a468a95b8493dc5d76","8bd231fd5382cf2f128314af40390b21e4b41a6d","6b460e27aa9d71d98a181b861ec1de83653d8292","0447f4290970a7850f9313d84ee87ff56d8a24ce","a6d3ceea74deba7ba762ec051492d79794933e98","b9df8d5aa789a9d1f47d4212a956c1c2f09732b6","125a6447604601729b315c34bbade71ec23a82d0","4f45b5d187b458a63a9d54a8105356eaa028b0d2","dc26c4dc7cff10cfd0ee8b42cf3ffd3f01ab4815","9542f80403ef8093a8df142a8148f6685de781cb","c022f6c00005f72517b0eb0461498a52fdeda541","11f32b8188b044ad61666d0435b0285fa8fff04a","82cc738a817a5031d660aaa3f8bf647e2ece9909","26f992cf4d996d1a993b9e30e19fc929934fe428","ecb6395c987ab8b42907ebb1787173872f8121fa","0541d5338adc48276b3b8cd3a141d799e2d40150","7a75c886b043e7c3f77829412774de27648f384a"],"id":"c6349ec38eb508295451894014708c105bcf84cd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c6349ec38eb508295451894014708c105bcf84cd","authors":[{"name":"Xiangdong Huang","ids":["2916053"]},{"name":"Jianmin Wang","ids":["1751179"]},{"name":"Raymond K.

Many of the tweets can be associated to real-world entities for providing additional information for the latter. In this paper, we aim to associate tweets that are semantically related to real-world locations or Points of Interest (POIs). Tweets contain dynamic and real-time information while POIs contain relatively static information. The tweets associated with POIs provide complementary information for many applications like opinion mining and POI recommendation; the associated POIs can also be used as POI tags in Twitter. We define the research problem of annotating POIs with tweets and propose a novel supervised Bayesian Model (sBM). The model takes into account the textual, spatial features and user behaviors together with the supervised information of whether a tweet is POI-related. It is able to capture user interests in latent regions for the prediction of whether a tweet is POI-related and the association between the tweet and its most semantically related POI. On tweets and POIs collected for two cities (New York City and Singapore), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our models against baseline methods.","inCitations":["57c72cb88843d44b43192741c7010558bb451394","1d7532735001e8997149681d0212e4198e4553ce","6f71c4fcfc48aa0a552861ee1c61e1deee0833b8","003149de4e736bf5d1f3375d3c8d5f4b9f5796c6","97e6772ea02022990f474569207857dc585801dc"],"pmid":"","title":"Annotating Points of Interest with Geo-tagged Tweets","journalPages":"417-426","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/kqzhao/cikm16poi.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983850"],"entities":["Apache POI","Baseline (configuration management)","Bayesian network","Entity","Point of interest","Real-time data","Supervised learning","Text corpus","User-generated content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["55647abc885e4a62aaa46765a89bbd46d4ebdef2","01e8bd22294c78505f9df0ad65771728959cb302","57be087d76308239b5f538586128879fd33c2e58","1fb53788bd052bc09e727aaab8d381b8ff9a201d","6195df04d7e529e8e2ba99c04c23d9ff04e66187","d0c5b3f5dcc1c37b7555f76f7b36264eeb7701ea","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","68db7962b63bb775575403e650870f53e418f062","427b168f490b56716f22b129ac93aba5425ea08f","b7a87a966fb723a4d30c06648f61ae500aa16bdb","2f9f77ee4fa453cd114665f8b487570c0affe235","087ab67119b7caf129e93d8daa170a7c12a2a8f6","5b8bb97a5b5fc489d0e8f4a626c4257f9babb0b1","6a08a92f1d990f89e87aec2af243227984b98980","a6479cb9223151557cf3eac1f5b138c13ae9a45b","76c2f936e57f94bacf5a532745032fefa6bc59ee","cc77f64fdf860ce583335303526db7054def8157","b0b95b80690a619471ccd7bca20f5dc82afeccd7","751adca5b4b1ea9fc1f51c0e7ef0f8d702e37988","d2e7d37dac6b9eb313bd7918f162485111608bea","85215d5d3c31d08adcf49e6767c048e2883e0daf","1c347f18b5bbbd30baf49e28d523da2d3af9b7cd","df6bf99bd282e1fa0c3e748220e96e5ba16125ce","354217a75a9c9ec9bcdbf945e999b44f383b8897","a1dfec89e0842e3e1ffaa773da8b9ef53a89fb28","7e5fdab51bad04baba77db56661517ad45714fc3","65ee4429b5509173f12309539e809ac533e84690","45c8591533ee33e154167401d4f2e7331b82ada5","67a77d3242a357571541d39c26d305c5dda89445"],"id":"6e2a53a1409e0e8c964a2aa219ddcb30694caeb9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6e2a53a1409e0e8c964a2aa219ddcb30694caeb9","authors":[{"name":"Kaiqi Zhao","ids":["1995855"]},{"name":"Gao Cong","ids":["1737379"]},{"name":"Aixin Sun","ids":["1735962"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983850"}

To achieve this goal, it is crucial to precisely predict users\u2019 real-time intent. Intent is closely related to context, which includes not only the spatial-temporal information but also users\u2019 current activities that can be sensed by mobile devices. The relationship between intent and context is highly dynamic and exhibits chaotic sequential correlation. The context itself is often sparse and heterogeneous. The dynamics and co-movement among contextual signals are also elusive and complicated. Traditional recommendation models cannot directly apply to proactive experiences because they fail to tackle the above challenges. Inspired by the nowcasting practice in meteorology and macroeconomics, we propose an innovative collaborative nowcasting model to effectively resolve these challenges. The proposed model successfully addresses sparsity and heterogeneity of contextual signals. It also effectively models the convoluted correlation within contextual signals and between context and intent. Specifically, the model first extracts collaborative latent factors, which summarize shared temporal structural patterns in contextual signals, and then exploits the collaborative Kalman Filter to generate serially correlated personalized latent factors, which are utilized to monitor each user\u2019s realtime intent. Extensive experiments with real-world data sets from a commercial digital assistant demonstrate the effectiveness of the collaborative nowcasting model. The studied problem and model provide inspiring implications for new paradigms of recommendations on mobile intelligent devices.","inCitations":["4f0e848db488b79a83308f4296b181ca34ba0d2c","f1b80aa91ca036d77acd29e6e337b3d873548a33","ec290ece702bbcd3c828369c1715a1a4cc6fa772","7f3e17bb4137b4b8430692d77de7f79e9f1529df","c82840923eeded245a8dab2dd102d8b0cf96758a","e3c2ee4323d1f84b7a397127f87652529797fa1f","41f57cfd08de7bed06f3dcd1a7bfc604a57f0b1a","1c613561cab3898792fb4a1e48252b61507003ba","c6f2210f122052e5390b8cb620cb0dc8c0d409f2","8602936e6dc8684336a5b9441293ec032e9fc351","28090e08919dca2c6f6799c1022810485eed0581","59a0c8c2d717fac30b07ede8a0399410f5c502ee","86a976533f11d327ba78f4dcb12328d93f0018ea"],"pmid":"","title":"Collaborative Nowcasting for Contextual Recommendation","journalPages":"1407-1418","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b919/733aa0e71f925305f7ba691975353ced1ce6.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/zr/publications/WWW2016_Collaborative_Nowcasting.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2874812","http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/suny3/paper/now_pre.pdf"],"entities":["Autocorrelation","Chaos theory","Cortana (Halo)","Experiment","Google Now","Heterogeneous computing","Kalman filter","Latent variable","Mobile device","Personal digital assistant","Personalization","Real-time computing","Real-time locating system","Sparse matrix","Structural pattern"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4a232361675d6ef76a8e3f3443e5399dbcb7e71b","25471816a77ba05f7cd9ee7831d3b7993c8d91ea","60697f436419b0a244efd81187d4dd64a0573880","5c2ac947d3df82dbf2348246ff6b102cb2585443","afd883ea35ba4df3ffbc9e564f453ee956fce05f","e50f4d3316d13841c287dcdf5479d7820d593571","2822de4e9dd2da060a4d813105e58ef76490bb89","29ce2ccf41d4c35ebe303828a1081ccc87964deb","61780edb89b3cfbd3bd13a01c26c1cf94e8a4d0d","83f8f7c8f449032a8a330ad17b9473cf497d3a0d","dc718625f298d73c3328c05b8604702e2bbc25dc","8451c2812a1476d3e13f2a509139322cc0adb1a2","6800fbe3314be9f638fb075e15b489d1aadb3030","0655380e56dd1eda65d869fdcb36402005f7efc2","8c3cea6e2587f3b45cff0e53e6ba9b78d5519dc5","d42b773244025f37d954a40f562ede478972f8c4","2790201c4164f599150b8c8f9db8ed58112858c9","18e93fa7d408e9596992f3d63155cb92827839a4","0b48a1f0a23e60713462c68dc77d1bfbf081875d","12b9f7948ca7bea4fb146aa38a90144d1d97c0ba","00cbb42367566a70e3c541d93b5873565b9b1288","62b867e87567b29a3981c8cd96f9656168c623f3","90b20a3359be2dce062885f811fd17ecf7ee4e3f","308b020f4d2b98676d103cc21908cd2cf9117a7d","0d38443073e7d12c7f25e57e713181420c74bc76"],"id":"ff5516989f89929492895aca1ba9f9254df61d64","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff5516989f89929492895aca1ba9f9254df61d64","authors":[{"name":"Yu Sun","ids":["35760122"]},{"name":"Nicholas Jing Yuan","ids":["2123146"]},{"name":"Xing Xie","ids":["49418974"]},{"name":"Kieran McDonald","ids":["3212523"]},{"name":"Rui Zhang","ids":["40482866"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872427.2874812"}

Arguably the most interesting and important questions one can ask about graphs have to do with their evolution. Which Web pages are showing an increasing popularity trend? How does influence propagate in social networks? How does knowledge evolve? In this paper we present our ongoing work on the Portal system, an open-source distributed framework for evolving graphs. Portal streamlines exploratory analysis of evolving graphs, making it efficient and usable, and providing critical tools to computational and data scientists. Our system implements a declarative query language by the same name, which we briefly describe in this paper. Our basic abstraction is a TGraph, which logically represents a series of adjacent snapshots. We present different physical representations of TGraphs and show results of a preliminary experimental evaluation of these physical representations for an important class of evolving graph analytics.","inCitations":["5c70422b3e67a49cee237c5eed4e4226e7373fd8","52c99d275a12e563ba4e193c39b4fb97ba46526d","31c593d92501a36711dc63d361e531454d1d5a01","e5c17deddc0a69c5bd3f9d1eeb515946277f76a1","7405494d2c98b69332fbbd5aaf4492acfa36eb42","6aaf6d121c0472fb9f6c881a48aa086dedcea185","e33c98fa9b8be6e89fa92565d4e8b693d98586d0","ac11fc3acdf5233bda411dee6d72a424e0b33c4e","f3b0ca9d0c420e6c6bc24a5e9dd959e8c899b38e","5d9628c1b108db7af510f45210b9d1cc46ef1a7e"],"pmid":"","title":"Towards a Distributed Infrastructure for Evolving Graph Analytics","journalPages":"843-848","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/35d3/74f4a92f035c1d3d2b9da61c1acbf46b1de1.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p843.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2889290","https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~julia/documents/tempweb16.pdf"],"entities":["Data science","Declarative programming","Open-source software","Query language","Semantic Web","Social network","Web page","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["897391c58a60d3e33697e3486800dbb5183d2b65","15ad785d44ff34ad028426c31a1e8d43b2b44ab6","05dbe031b635ab9572eed4ef88d8b0311a48b48e","4bc6ba5052654772c92c6007968964f64e4de1cc","30c8eaf92810eedd3482c33351b6080f16e4532d","021ac892933b4b8b4bd4de9d3678d6aa8b2a7778","1f2e6fbbb02a2ca514391f752e073a96fd395e6e","80481701464fcf07fbf5ab94df7884858c5927c1","7bba909bc4f20a43e021b1f6fb36dfbf03503a8c","203b5cc6045ed97604ed04eb6821848d6e1321db","57d015cb43b43913b54be7b5c73765b6382d7e99","1558a06fb4f0473f76792e830b0b07c79f7decc0","c22bdeb25d1e217ee2927f689b0f3205181f1430","f4197ce66b5513c70389b223acdeae3f0a3e1f1f","201a5add33896165a50fb8111bf63175b84af3bf","31f27864950a6c417cf996927b2d5558f70d2b14","056d3a74541d77e3a4ed17367e1c6389d30d5275","2d4855de1d583c6ce59510dd098f77606dcf986c","4a20823dd4ce6003e31f7d4e0649fe8c719926f2","331ec0bba9287f16689c23c0e607b9d5f62251d8","082fc3b5c37f26ca1194b36c38672e62d48009cb","4cad280e1d2cbb3317ad5341bd02a042ff1cb27c","080f44d89bf6f4404f476ffec8d2f8ad3f60e07d"],"id":"35d374f4a92f035c1d3d2b9da61c1acbf46b1de1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/35d374f4a92f035c1d3d2b9da61c1acbf46b1de1","authors":[{"name":"Vera Zaychik Moffitt","ids":["2488896"]},{"name":"Julia Stoyanovich","ids":["1682824"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2889290"}

Beyond many practical applications, (such as cross domain analysis, recommendation, and link prediction), understanding this problem more generally informs us on the privacy implications of data disclosure. Previous work has typically addressed this question using either different portions of the same dataset or observing the same behavior across thematically similar domains. In contrast, the general cross-domain case where users have different profiles independently generated from a common but unknown pattern raises new challenges, including difficulties in validation, and remains under-explored. In this paper, we address the reconciliation problem for location-based datasets and introduce a robust method for this general setting. Location datasets are a particularly fruitful domain to study: such records are frequently produced by users in an increasing number of applications and are highly sensitive, especially when linked to other datasets. Our main contribution is a generic and self-tunable algorithm that leverages any pair of sporadic location-based datasets to determine the most likely matching between the users it contains. While making very general assumptions on the patterns of mobile users, we show that the maximum weight matching we compute is provably correct. Although true cross-domain datasets are a rarity, our experimental evaluation uses two entirely new data collections, including one we crawled, on an unprecedented scale. The method we design outperforms naive rules and prior heuristics. As it combines both sparse and dense properties of location-based data and accounts for probabilistic dynamics of observation, it can be shown to be robust even when data gets sparse.

Aiming to raise awareness, and to promote behaviour change, governments and organisations are conducting multiple pro-environmental campaigns, particularly via social media. However, to the best of our knowledge, these campaigns are neither based on, nor do they take advantage of, the existing theories and studies of behaviour change, to better target and inform users. In this paper we propose an approach for analysing user behaviour towards climate change based on the 5 Doors Theory of behaviour change [19]. Our approach automatically identifies five behavioural stages in which users are based on their social media contributions. This approach has been applied to analyse the online behaviour of participants of the Earth Hour 2015 and COP21 Twitter movements. Results of our analysis are used to provide guidelines on how to improve communication via these campaigns.","inCitations":["451172598f5286f5e39dea0fb51b8c4891e7a409","2aed501271a36f05b417bc415e5eabb2a46aece1","df754dbd6de5ce5c9930bcf5a6241f3c9fcd419e"],"pmid":"","title":"Talking climate change via social media: communication, engagement and behaviour","journalPages":"85-94","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://oro.open.ac.uk/46530/1/FernandezWebSci2016_v9.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2908131.2908167"],"entities":["Social media","Theory"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d4001e7534c0414093a5e6d8a6a836ce340f6ff7","3761aaf4cfdc51f3440a2d9b46044a672badfca5","752f552cf78438d90e9fca18ce1d21c565fa12d5","ad0bee1ac722390a1a2536407f2ca26cd619c4c8","6a96742984e4327d73bc988e931c221a25061037","9c5dedef23abca563452a62549f6bb74c18b649f","83f872dc063c5fb2d5b8a9ff76538a4ee17662eb","bfc4032408d7940a777001afdcffd9ad54870ff0","cd570775bdc0f99479a5350af76b9b8657b13143","0bb74b33e555a956416b8d9b1859dbecbbe74b8e","78906b479b72944d6bc4f6b1a162187c4f1774cc"],"id":"70286a607da6dd726f7a4fbfbf999aa3abc4ed70","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/70286a607da6dd726f7a4fbfbf999aa3abc4ed70","authors":[{"name":"Miriam Fernández","ids":["33402800"]},{"name":"Lara Schibelsky G.

Children shape tomorrow's society, so it is essential that this audience becomes agile with searching information. Although young users prefer well-known search engines, their lack of skill in formulating adequate queries and the fact that search tools were not designed explicitly with children in mind, can result in poor outcomes. The reasons for this include children's limited vocabulary, which makes it challenging to articulate information needs using short queries, or their tendency to create queries that are too long, which translates to few or irrelevant retrieved results. To enhance web search environments in response to children's behaviors and expectations, in this paper we discuss an initial effort to verify well-known issues, and identify yet to be explored ones, that affect children in formulating (natural language or keyword) queries. We also present a novel search intent module developed in response to these issues, which can seamlessly be integrated with existing search engines favored by children. The proposed module interprets a child's query and creates a shorter and more concise query to submit to a search engine, which can lead to a more successful search session. Initial experiments conducted using a sample of children queries validate the correctness of the proposed search intent module.","inCitations":["b92b72be343c9bd53642446a6553469cd091c328","0eec3c98a32081d948efdefaf474643efe0d9348","1a2f41a91992aaa4ce30fe42e96bf52eb8f0ecf2"],"pmid":"","title":"\"Is Sven Seven?\": A Search Intent Module for Children","journalPages":"885-888","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914738"],"entities":["Agile software development","Correctness (computer science)","Experiment","Information needs","Internet","Natural language","Relevance","Session (web analytics)","Sven Jaschan","Vocabulary","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b17bd7c53848436e3bbede62db81198473eb8fed","629e9a402eb593b4681bd65491552f3be9456c2b","4d72f04dda676d561e4d4a17f307f9bf720e14c6","0310797bc00fcea692c4a97611979fe8620b764a","5436b501fe15e1a5c0554027b151422d106a336d","6cca19f55dc5a30658b87eaa72a374b45f7de9ac","3a22dd5d40d25d2fa5ec46d90f54382ae2f26f88","6df52d4189d2e48e7a4cc96c47603076fb17d4dd","308c1656b5a6ceb8dbd4d72e8e68d77af8439c04","1ebf2ce330becea23784b37dd8078043f8969305","cb88804cd7afce7b15f8a57b4f555313ab5784f6","7740bfcf470392064de3d7ee97d10cd8f3f5cd18"],"id":"44ad2456b228f112a3e4e8c63e961542c6c0682e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/44ad2456b228f112a3e4e8c63e961542c6c0682e","authors":[{"name":"Nevena Dragovic","ids":["2485037"]},{"name":"Ion Madrazo Azpiazu","ids":["46280773"]},{"name":"Maria Soledad Pera","ids":["1726495"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2914738"}

Two recent trends are changing the email experience: smartphones have become the primary tool for accessing online services including email, and machine learning has come of age. Smartphones have a number of compelling properties (they are location-aware, usually with us, and allow us to record and share photos and videos), but they also have a few limitations, notably limited screen size and small and tedious virtual keyboards. Over the past few years, Google researchers and engineers have leveraged machine learning to ameliorate these weaknesses, and in the process created novel experiences. In this talk, I will give three examples of machine learning improving the email experience. The first example describes how we are improving email search. Displaying the most relevant results as the query is being typed is particularly useful on smartphones due to the aforementioned limitations. Combining hand-crafted and machine-learned rankers is powerful, but training learned rankers requires a relevance-labeled training set. User privacy prohibits us from employing raters to produce relevance labels. Instead, we leverage implicit feedback (namely clicks) provided by the users themselves. Using click logs as training data in a learning-to-rank setting is intriguing, since there is a vast and continuous supply of fresh training data. However, the click stream is biased towards queries that receive more clicks -- e.g. queries for which we already return the best result in the top-ranked position. I will summarize our work on neutralizing that bias.\n The second example describes how we extract key information from appointment and reservation emails and surface it at the appropriate time as a reminder on the user's smartphone. Our basic approach is to learn the templates that were used to generate these emails, use these templates to extract key information such as places, dates and times, store the extracted records in a personal information store, and surface them at the right time, taking contextual information such as estimated transit time into account.\n The third example describes Smart Reply, a system that offers a set of three short responses to those incoming emails for which a short response is appropriate, allowing users to respond quickly with just a few taps, without typing or involving voice-to-text transcription. The basic approach is to learn a model of likely short responses to original emails from the corpus, and then to apply the model whenever a new message arrives. Other considerations include offering a set of responses that are all appropriate and yet diverse, and triggering only when sufficiently confident that each responses is of high quality and appropriate.","inCitations":["56d3374789d93575b8a5ae2c064802a2041c6041","27b98ffbb4549167dda0841d873fef317db34567"],"pmid":"","title":"Using Machine Learning to Improve the Email Experience","journalPages":"891","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983371","https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45673.pdf"],"entities":["Clickstream","Display resolution","Display size","E-services","Email","Learning to rank","Location awareness","Machine learning","Personally identifiable information","Relevance","Smartphone","Speech recognition","Test set","Text corpus","Transcription (software)","Virtual keyboard","Webmail"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7b8833ee8d9a78f9bf0696527ac68c5e5d957fb7","3fdfdd8783512e92b8aef3044102c2a52f2692e7","f0b5bd1ea9af8582f5d7231be90092001f693236"],"id":"04e8fd1c6df307c65581f6c45e30ecc9407b9dbc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04e8fd1c6df307c65581f6c45e30ecc9407b9dbc","authors":[{"name":"Marc Najork","ids":["1763978"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983371"}

In addition, we adopt Author-Journal-Topic (AJT) model to take both authors and journals into consideration of topic analysis. For the study, we collect the 6,360 full-text articles from PubMed Central and select the top 15 journals on Oncology. By applying AJT model, we identify what the major topics are shared among researchers in Oncology and which authors and journal lead the idea exchange in sub-disciplines of Oncology.","inCitations":["055a758cea739f4c53336a69e667ab8d3f2ebabe","7f9bfb07582300c6e43293858fb53443a76f9731","89b2a5ee0b7c516b0a04df053d114d36021ed583","40f780e6f7b21ed1ca1cb973bb797c040a01118d","a19a4e4a1e11d33e61a32130564aef44d2855115"],"pmid":"","title":"Exploring the Leading Authors and Journals in Major Topics by Citation Sentences and Topic Modeling","journalPages":"42-50","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/35f7/374c1fc743487a76ff5b7cf4479a1ea0b3f2.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://anthology.aclweb.org/attachments/W/W16/W16-1506.Presentation.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology/attachments/W/W16/W16-1506.Presentation.pdf","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/W/W16/W16-1506.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1506","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/attachments/W/W16/W16-1506.Presentation.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-1506.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W16/W16-1506.pdf","http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W16/W16-1506.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/attachments/W/W16/W16-1506.Presentation.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1610/paper6.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-1506.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology//attachments/W/W16/W16-1506.Presentation.pdf"],"entities":["Embedded system","PubMed Central","Topic model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["078fdc9d7dd7105dcc5e65aa19edefe3e48e8bc7","57e9443d64e2545dbee470a5960017855dc97a5e","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","92c43bf9bd0e535ab1fc7573dc192e6d4c25728d","beffcc56fe960b900cf093338600c788067e233e","0a2cf7fe61a37530a4d6da6520c05bb3b6bb9d0e","352883315a7edef43a4980404f2f8d4468864351","317c72f816169355154929a2d96df7d674e2a105","4bcc5805550c11dbde0a744eb963e5ddf5a5fa22","59cce25151fe4d70383624dd535f533617dd8025"],"id":"35f7374c1fc743487a76ff5b7cf4479a1ea0b3f2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/35f7374c1fc743487a76ff5b7cf4479a1ea0b3f2","authors":[{"name":"Ha Jin Kim","ids":["2970991"]},{"name":"Juyoung An","ids":["3416134"]},{"name":"Yoo Kyung Jeong","ids":["3124978"]},{"name":"Min Song","ids":["37956915"]}],"doi":""}

In implicit feedback settings, all the items, including the ones that a user did not consume, are taken into consideration. But this assumption does not accord with the common sense understanding that users have a limited scope and awareness of items. For example, a user might not have heard of a certain paper, or might live too far away from a restaurant to experience it. In the language of causal analysis [9], the assignment mechanism (i.e., the items that a user is exposed to) is a latent variable that may change for various user/item combinations. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach that directly incorporates user exposure to items into collaborative filtering. The exposure is modeled as a latent variable and the model infers its value from data. In doing so, we recover one of the most successful state-of-theart approaches as a special case of our model [8], and provide a plug-in method for conditioning exposure on various forms of exposure covariates (e.g., topics in text, venue locations). We show that our scalable inference algorithm outperforms existing benchmarks in four different domains both with and without exposure covariates.","inCitations":["da2a79e1c87cd23efcb0fca3ddb747f2e0d8e42a","01f72ed3b6ddbd006e2f83bd7f60d83a279e693d","6314ecddeca850fe93e7fe4471f5bf112439046f","9c259f81257355f1e6a386d5f9ea5e4fe7744447","c8211bc846a42de016fc6b31e17bda2d33016ef2","b0f7e146bff2f5be42c4d84eac2f7309310c54b7","67c04e949cc98c7dcc48dea0c94043d4ebf542db","a735f238e07372e2d68c84f471d43ed27377b479","f5a784a1646c06592e7de9a214f94eb7d02ff0ff","9988f2b32152991b7e930fbbb61b48bbd743970c","97cefa2f54d30bf40b2bf71a9297949ed5a327ee","1b2084f46e1133624438f87d3c3edba0bfd053fc","cf933ca85f4505cebe874be2b9256748c75697be","0e443ed401707d9bf95aca485709400d6b5eae63","fafffa56d097614c1e913c645cd68937ab6f72bc","22e7debbb68550273c0362b61604889f34d14d2a","4e6bd3eeb15413a22cb611be2770a632b31a1951","e35eb235a62b4f17bf6557be186798ba767ee1e0","730f0604a490fd911170adc5d5c060bef79017fd","c4e72c764266d85ce0ade71fa812bda43bdd6437","5040fbd12612bd1d5c630aea3c5cc0b53785b9fb","55905e637d4c06cd16e331ac9417d93d896472fd","b02373e212f391d1764b9568f1df238920963ed3","313c42b415f4d3c710be197a901b4106848994b7","e8bea9acfe138dcefcdc179dc6628db22c0f2808","c6423364ec00b743a7784eb4cdb56ba63eb67d18","51ecde10c37b2b76b733b55aff9a385a6ac2c3fb","11567ecd7b849a3ff9b22fb85f4345944ad28c37","0f95aa631f88512667da9b06e95deedfe410a8b8","b3a09907c3cb9ff393a739ac205cfe7e26ad172b","c8c75669d7fc51328017b0f3e4dc96d3e1a87448","6b89dc35c4a5290264615e9483732323c82b3f5e","178c1e339fcc606b4cf692f1cc341a13c4816c01","92a7c5adb9471105e44218519f9ebbf03bec3f9d","37d383cdd23284e1b238ce6611b0662439830eea","ef8243c9cdaac5220cc54728acb3b0faf59779b2","9ed4eebceeab3cb87ea32b29061736cf98e55eaa","838e9ddc41b6badb9bf1f64cd7e2a18f8adda057","e89a36f18483c8450d2a558d8587e457b816a883","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc"],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling User Exposure in Recommendation","journalPages":"951-961","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3b93/f37e5af2f6f66af33720dc8d0e4de7dc4e65.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/proceedings/p951.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07025","http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/papers/expo-mf.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07025v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07025v2.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883090","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07025v2.pdf","http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/LiangCharlinMcInerneyBlei2016.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Book","Causality","Collaborative filtering","Extensibility","Feedback","Interaction","Latent variable","Logistic regression","Plug-in (computing)","Scalability","User (computing)","Venue (sound system)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b36ef7990cc517cf6817332cda11da6ea5812bae","2ef7d506b25731d0f3ec0c8f90b718b6e5bbd069","2ebf3b1c0084cf6e57dd8ef921c2ca36d72d6a75","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","2f9f77ee4fa453cd114665f8b487570c0affe235","8735340bed4503bf21e50ec65872ceee68301470","9aa88a8a354f1d322e242376d27d0474e50252f8","02d1105bec3877ed8cd2d28f76b67ae8ba3f2331","545122e2990590524459ec9b59ccac6ce71e3b6a","0aa2a4d259433016ebc899c496faea03c024c0bd","659d04916a4d6de5d41224b23c0e1a9a70330cfe","5fdb4d01de892bfd5a4e3956bb4edbcfa9d92512","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","5aaf311172b9778d78f6904fbe40124c63463b57","82c87b80d71110d13a624ef06af934077edb22f7","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","26e8f3cc46b710a013358bf0289df4de033446ba","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","64c871cd7e0af7e1aeb94d98c6214eb8d8e8b989","3d905d37e1d94773699b9644d1342f0ab32d34a3","4a31ca27b987606ae353b300488068b5240633ee","d641ce8fe01ba5ae0ade43feaa1e1e2a7f4839b8","25ad8ad3d1549888a4609659bd55ad825c5df82e","b1a19e2849c60898240caad42e879337ccedbe39","315eb50f7bea92e1f2d569e511e009e8e1ed3aa8","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","579b3ddd45855a29c9909ed3cef6e94f064e1a79","1109e93f93a8ddd0d4802e73e81900b671246dc1","517d6e3999bd425069e45346045adcbd2d0c9299"],"id":"06b1cdc6d69ea3b34b5a8b146f8f54367fa10564","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/06b1cdc6d69ea3b34b5a8b146f8f54367fa10564","authors":[{"name":"Dawen Liang","ids":["1702877"]},{"name":"Laurent Charlin","ids":["1778839"]},{"name":"James McInerney","ids":["10758606"]},{"name":"David M.

In this paper, we present a novel solution to handling multifaceted seeds by combining existing user-generated ontologies with a novel word-similarity metric based on skip-grams. By blending the two resources we are able to produce sparse word ego-networks that are centered on the seed terms and are able to capture semantic equivalence among words. We demonstrate that the resulting networks possess internally-coherent clusters, which can be exploited to provide non-overlapping expansions, in order to reflect different semantic classes of the seeds. Empirical evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines shows that our solution, EgoSet, is able to not only capture multiple facets in the input query, but also generate expansions for each facet with higher precision.","inCitations":["69ad31ab9b925e39a767f38e5738e6ad7c08b45a","12af98b4fed2efc71fe850de3cbbd35191161967","9309499fbc2c4bceb28ee229aa91e1345912d52c","37cc20381657bac28e68445d08432bb7da3cd087","09d2395d168edf70248e30cab75e7c6d2c70ea57","ff5aed24fcfcbd19e7a16f43d817030b55806031","f1deaabba34c5e0c5346fb94588777edc321e35c","db3183139863fe1535f75a23a9dd9ccca3bf17b4","741d50647afac926dce001160d8253c7a5c14ca3","4e515b2a34e7fa0ef29e03e4f4df4b127aa3ff41","1db39b4fb420f12576e994585b1fe9f866ea4974","9c0a8bb3588550156da157f621919c15ebb06dbb","fa2f7bab8d105a4b92048a683ef2e1b2de46481c","12947fa637d2e95ba533672a78cc2897f6e2d666","dd30bbd7149678d9be191df4e286842001be6fb0","e161baa1efc8ff6fae1d863b79130f55217f7c6e","1081cbdc7eaa0dd9cbeb2f821904030db15853ee","a4482ca1d3cf2bec5114337276933fe40e0cca3b","095b979ac75fc70468f6894369dae0bcfc564c21"],"pmid":"","title":"EgoSet: Exploiting Word Ego-networks and User-generated Ontology for Multifaceted Set Expansion","journalPages":"645-654","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://ai2-s2-pdf-tmp.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdf70.pdf","http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/cs512/2016/wsdm16_qmei.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2835776.2835808","http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/pub/wsdm2016-egoset.pdf"],"entities":["Alpha compositing","Baseline (configuration management)","Coherence (physics)","Computer cluster","Grams","Mechatronics","N-gram","Ontology (information science)","Result set","Skip list","Social network","Sparse matrix","Turing completeness","User-generated content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["05bcd2f5d1833ac354de01341d73e42203a5b6c0","34aec4d172f59c1ffe32f3afe3bf4ffc5cd7559a","74bee1ebf204dba4b2da0399a25a5ac9253a824e","72487af4c73e1d0b9ae88db63f7436543cbc3fe3","13a84e7cf04cc5203b1b7eac57a52079ea4da64e","34b39ed1879f11d8ab84b758f0b7ba292eabc279","483793c68e73e4997a70625c502fa629caf93e38","2b9cd09b949b7e69933d18ae408397e803987151","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","2c0f2a03c3a427cc61359b5e2c31cfefe9850a31","a75c2d26ca6a06cbee62a8d1dad5993356d96793","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","07bc3eb2038cc8334e4ee9b96674ecbdbd045fc8","dc2d3b67dd94dc68876d38a3fb3502b615b6774b","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","34d76ad2680aa13faa9d1c0f2bf01473baeeaa6e","604bc2fb02b48d6d106215955a6a30629314df14","0db4db0a6a5aa0c9d3cf019d1d76b2452a203227","f8eae988049f6b0953884ed610a19fc2576290a0","11157109b8f3a098c5c3f801ba9acbffd2aa49b1","687e45af41bbe81646e052a716b71c3032a75de0","94770c3ed3c30a4b90885fb7593fe8d0ffeb705c","6e0b2b32aa3eed696aa868386d485321a63ccebb","00fce98c3fda59bcb84b6d0626fb3137d2fbb984","4586eae7af09bf653cee78d71ba25711ec3b3e5a","00192014ff412bc2e68728b9b083177ba7bb8097","20ad0ba7e187e6f335a08c59a4e53da4e4b027ec","8ac172eadcd12af6cf60813c8c28db2c8dee89a0","0183b3e9d84c15c7048e6c2149ed86257ccdc6cb","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","b5e12de7d3f2a66bfcf10a510f9ac80afb3541c1","12af98b4fed2efc71fe850de3cbbd35191161967","312a2edbec5fae34beaf33faa059d37d04cb7235","01bd55608de56aa92696318b47f8db53ce5b0bc4","666b639aadcd2a8a11d24b36bae6a4f07e802b34","6b2a7983bc4dc8016415cdd0c508b5dfe961d6cd"],"id":"12b3d1c636a895c88bb074941f02256a86f94af3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/12b3d1c636a895c88bb074941f02256a86f94af3","authors":[{"name":"Xin Rong","ids":["35226089"]},{"name":"Zhe Chen","ids":["1696121"]},{"name":"Qiaozhu Mei","ids":["1743469"]},{"name":"Eytan Adar","ids":["2630700"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2835776.2835808"}

Despite their overwhelming success, a rigorous and easy to interpret mathematical explanation of the influence of input variables on a output produced by a neural network is still missing.\n We propose a generic framework as well as a concrete method for quantifying the influence of individual input signals on the output computed by a deep neural network. Inspired by the variable weighting scheme in the log-linear combination of variables in logistic regression, the proposed method provides linear models for specific observations of the input variables. This linear model locally approximates the behaviour of the neural network and can be used to quantify the influence of input variables in a principled way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets.","inCitations":["96ceb1f3f5c3aec42ce8fc7549e06c63cdbfbb07","1b89769550599a66d00f3a733fcd04f5d96e501f"],"pmid":"","title":"LICON: A Linear Weighting Scheme for the Contribution ofInput Variables in Deep Artificial Neural Networks","journalPages":"45-54","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983746"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Deep learning","Experiment","Linear model","Log-linear model","Logistic regression","Neural Networks","Pattern recognition","Synthetic intelligence"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["42fb1207777cc361b343029e0ea6f565f2d1a840","fc550414bb4992e80a8750f32e8d376db05d8e29","6e54468b46c29f593943775eedfd42693f3bf574","6d8c9fcce8177d6f8d122d653c7d32d7624d6714","4e6238c8613b5b81f81552939bce33296aedfbfe","d5e392035d5f4b1ae37027cabfd1bfdf6733015b","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","df99fcc2bb666c29d762bcb77d7959e0d0495176","17a273bbd4448083b01b5a9389b3c37f5425aac0","2116b2eaaece4af9c28c32af2728f3d49b792cf9","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","32ebb41d58c8969bf03632352a23e0536b5c45a6","19f2ebdaf7accefc3aff89abf5f04a805a3aa92f","4aa5d73c67c915b62cb3843b67031c249dc5e82f","340f48901f72278f6bf78a04ee5b01df208cc508","03cb609fcfce6c60cbe3eb0dd8254069bf6d7573","321514a76a09d7a6fca00d27eda92663236c0f66","c6abd7da2c7c999c2edcfa6051aca899ee94073b"],"id":"79a8c97ae30de57e2409282b2196fbecf673d64f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79a8c97ae30de57e2409282b2196fbecf673d64f","authors":[{"name":"Gjergji Kasneci","ids":["1686448"]},{"name":"Thomas Gottron","ids":["1752017"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983746"}

Metrics are a powerful tool used in organizations to set goals, decide which new products and features should be released to customers, which new tests and experiments should be conducted, and how resources should be allocated. To a large extent, metrics drive the direction of an organization, and getting metrics 'right' is one of the most important and difficult problems an organization needs to solve. However, creating good metrics that capture long-term company goals is difficult. They try to capture abstract concepts such as success, delight, loyalty, engagement, life-time value, etc. How can one determine that a metric is a good one? Or, that one metric is better than another? In other words, how do we measure the quality of metrics? Can the evaluation process be automated so that anyone with an idea of a new metric can quickly evaluate it? In this paper we describe the metric evaluation system deployed at Bing, where we have been working on designing and improving metrics for over five years. We believe that by applying a data driven approach to metric evaluation we have been able to substantially improve our metrics and, as a result, ship better features and improve search experience for Bing's users.","inCitations":["cb100d843c4f3d6ca4ea71b31aba568a817aae02","b7c862e989e552d259d85f5b5c5fbe7350d58f58","e6678ffbcbd186bc338a008259b9232c12b48b74","b48a31a9cf4b4d3748220de99548b0a4f0e2aebd"],"pmid":"","title":"Measuring Metrics","journalPages":"429-437","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/2016CIKM_MeasuringMetrics.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983356"],"entities":["Experiment","Time value of money"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["971e5a9ea7156682e047df8f385853f599d673d9","049ba16a73e4493c0d62db369e4f9a1c4820cbb2","5ea4873fee47c25a50f33afac0ae4a41e6e5a1c7","c77be34db96695159244723fe9ffa4a88dc4a36d","1835d78ec81b54507aae02b5ee1e2f2d8f56c14c","9b9c4bf53eb680e2eb26b456c4752a23dafb2d5e","08f7125bc2dd4ce529a2277ded9bc018fe120329","993d394fd5c63f9efa310fba938fba677141801c","35508a476f2be93bd5a43427d414abbc2785ac9c","235cf387b1a597078c9d9c1cbc794dd1e37b8dc3","1436dc6212bb88166bf6568ba56b81353485278e","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","925cc228f463ef493b3ab036b659df0d292bb087","abc853bd9a67dd87ebce025a7dc94fb467b067b9","657fee19109a156d295b0d00b128fc10653a0646","a5203a54528b4ff60c6d1078087e82829b39e365","1ab758492347723ae8ad20257715f3fd49e75c27","6ddc0dc940134c72ca355fafb78936a88f08927a","d3e63af2dd2ba4867dfd087cc777e5a0ff41d2a0"],"id":"2a7bc84cc16b49d302466c4f8f52d297eb51ecb1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2a7bc84cc16b49d302466c4f8f52d297eb51ecb1","authors":[{"name":"Pavel Dmitriev","ids":["1802046"]},{"name":"Xian Wu","ids":["1738906"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983356"}

As conventional recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering become inapplicable in the problem, we propose a new recommendation method which exploits the implicit matching rules between human faces and eyeglasses. We first define fine-grained attributes for human faces and frames of glasses respectively. Then, we develop a recommendation framework based on a probabilistic graphical model, which effectively captures the correlation among these fine-grained attributes. Ranking of the frames (glasses) is done by their similarity to the query facial attributes. Finally, we produce a synthesized image for the input face to demonstrate the visual effect when wearing the recommended glasses.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"iGlasses: A Novel Recommendation System for Best-fit Glasses","journalPages":"1109-1112","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911453"],"entities":["Collaborative filtering","Curve fitting","Graphical model","Image processing","Recommender system","Visual effects"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7a953aaf29ef67ee094943d4be50d753b3744573","f731b6745d829241941307c3ebf163e90e200318","3958db5769c927cfc2a9e4d1ee33ecfba86fe054","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701","8ade5d29ae9eac7b0980bc6bc1b873d0dd12a486","3089e6745b7dd50e41a3a50c6ff831415fe22739"],"id":"1de71a80f59da79a50e3af98aa3d21249370eb7b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1de71a80f59da79a50e3af98aa3d21249370eb7b","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoling Gu","ids":["1922442"]},{"name":"Lidan Shou","ids":["4983704"]},{"name":"Pai Peng","ids":["49658029"]},{"name":"Ke Chen","ids":["38429669"]},{"name":"Sai Wu","ids":["1765710"]},{"name":"Gang Chen","ids":["39076756"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2911453"}

However, most of IR research is still carried out as laboratory studies using test collections. As there is a lack of appropriate scholarly test collections, we argue in this position paper that one or more well-crafted test collections with scholarly documents is needed in order to engage the IR community whole-heartedly in Bibliometric IR research, and to facilitate foundational and high-quality work in this area. Based on the experiences gained from creating the iSearch test collection (Lykke et al. 2010 http://itlab.dbit.dk/~isearch/) we reflect on the properties of an ideal scholarly IR test collection and then examine three possible ways of realising the creation of such a collection. The first considers the possibilities for basing the test collection on the ever more readily available open access collections of scholarly documents; the second examines the possibilities of setting up alliances with proprietary content producers or aggregators; and the third considers collaboration with major university libraries and their content.","inCitations":["323a3aa15df0ada9e9d851002afcd5da74a240b5","39357471df8784a2103828da0710c48140c001d0","8ff7f47ef653603b6f65c128627c280ca1026dba","4c6c87a15502643285faf1c835ccfc15036c8df4","13e46f771d84d427756fde1058a95159f6ff1197","845c5ea182a1de8855cafa93965da87cc4316ab0"],"pmid":"","title":"On the Need for and Provision for an 'IDEAL' Scholarly Information Retrieval Test Collection","journalPages":"73-81","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9734/108a118785515844a6c6f2aa5930b141db41.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1567/paper8.pdf"],"entities":["Bibliometrics","Document","IDEAL","Information retrieval","Interaction","Library (computing)","News aggregator","Operational system","Test case"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5ae4fba1eb22d443153a2cfead259b17ba0077f1","28aba9700b0620e2957bc366f7e493419fccf791","3158d2b048b79a11eb2849c6dd44517fe197ab7b","55b49bdaa3cf0fffe5117b9f5027b5513cb31aab","4990643fd376a754b535a1ff47aaa2ccb4764102","3b6a3d36b964a2a785bd0fb4a68abab680968472","05267f0a2a27aeaddee05ba3d45e3d029ec432fd"],"id":"9734108a118785515844a6c6f2aa5930b141db41","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9734108a118785515844a6c6f2aa5930b141db41","authors":[{"name":"Birger Larsen","ids":["4793316"]},{"name":"Christina Lioma","ids":["1784800"]}],"doi":""}

Even for networks of modest size, it is often difficult to evaluate all pairwise possibilities for links in a meaningful way. Furthermore, even though link prediction is closely related to missing value estimation problems, such as collaborative filtering, it is often difficult to use sophisticated models such as latent factor methods because of their computational complexity over very large networks. Due to this computational complexity, most known link prediction methods are designed for evaluating the link propensity over a specified subset of links, rather than for performing a global search over the entire networks. In practice, however, it is essential to perform an exhaustive search over the entire networks. In this paper, we propose an ensemble enabled approach to scaling up link prediction, which is able to decompose traditional link prediction problems into subproblems of smaller size. These subproblems are each solved with the use of latent factor models, which can be effectively implemented over networks of modest size. Furthermore, the ensemble enabled approach has several advantages in terms of performance. We show the advantage of using ensemble-based latent factor models with experiments on very large networks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.","inCitations":["f4327ba80eba669e36ccd1d7f9c1a8f9047fdef1","df4e257b5d763193d81e466a351728ff6d335fd3","3c4276279b015b6aa9381ab94689edb2d08e0198","f9afca10ea7bae49d39666675406fa8a8b4a7cce","2579d31debd31c8a0df3fc54cd3b4f0576d04581","ddb4a8628b2c262a98369cb28f27e4b2ad448332","d83612efcf16053e1cfa309aca8f6d5a1b35b7ba","bb8a5fe720c9e2f6fb6797d3ad3f99c0971d200b"],"pmid":"","title":"Scaling up Link Prediction with Ensembles","journalPages":"367-376","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://charuaggarwal.net/p367-duan.pdf","http://www.charuaggarwal.net/p367-duan.pdf","http://ai2-s2-pdf-tmp.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdf39.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2835776.2835815"],"entities":["Brute-force search","Collaborative filtering","Computational complexity theory","Computer performance","Experiment","Image scaling","Missing data","Scalability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["54f7eb68350e48d0b6eb073c2b66ead9fbfc479e","21081f3c94bfa12e99ad7cee9e2c5b0afe7a397d","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","46225772ac4f68a003a26f053bb248d77c7dbf87","29efbdf3f95cee97405accafdebd3bd374f1f003","8cd9aa720a3a2f9dcb52ad9eb1bf258a80ce0648","46c82a140edcb4619b9ad529a8222cf9f0b97517","d1ee87290fa827f1217b8fa2bccb3485da1a300e","00d23e5c06f90bed0c9d4aec22babb2f7488817f","211dfa4f2e379e4d37f96ee89abaff2acdd2a57c","4c3bce670150c86905e3c21e0b745a346fb4d068","3d798b253b08f3645eb6f5b092b2219b25df6ca6","12834eef7085cccbbc4b8074841527da82eaf4c3","d15aef555481ed5cd59474e9e2efbc1ee37d5e94","05c519fd3ed3c235eabd11905999ffe781d27a68","4fc8559dce9e98e4a181ff5018c3992882dc6359","10e44c294a968ca91e361fac44aa9d0f2cdf3bd3","2861ca61ccc8c87037224ee87f8dbe734ee08886","67433c37a064272cc6ba0d51feba7489a7cd10aa","39348c10c90be968357e2a6b65d5e0e479307735","0ec9ee064d9acc194adc0deace107d50a7f50c93","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701","096fd715499632bb769c9118b252467cb4409bd6","757ff9f08a2029005faafee660bab2c21287b095","1558a06fb4f0473f76792e830b0b07c79f7decc0","b44e6a0d20dcd8c3553c6f37052533ebc31945bf","0f223ef99bf6f1eac646f1d2f94b07f42ae98c08","29bae9472203546847ec1352a604566d0f602728","3a83bd97a340f5270fc99f1ea20a1708eb0111cb","0cd7531522c022c987dcc0434c4c836717d0998f","2dc147a786e305958987c2cab59ffb58a64ea97b","1e18a71cf45a5b81e64b31a9c330837b0d3c402b","10f272220cbca311c8379a72f9d5ba387b18c437","e7d30fefe1b99c21813873f976e46d03dc82b4fc","8cfffe4f41b37c7325ba912f98254075602934c8","4f23bee6098a51e428397513f6c5e87e45137c34","77226258c8efed9e047077fde94f5cdc932fcce9"],"id":"5fcd0bddeae261726d3c5552966857e89c59b97a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5fcd0bddeae261726d3c5552966857e89c59b97a","authors":[{"name":"Liang Duan","ids":["2623920"]},{"name":"Charu C.

In this way, the amount of content that the reader has to check is significantly reduced while additionally providing the reader with a global coverage of each event.

The goal of this work is to optimize the ad allocation from the platform's perspective. On the one hand, the platform would like to maximize revenue earned from each advertiser by exposing their ads to as many people as possible, on the other hand, the platform wants to reduce free-riding to ensure the truthfulness of the advertiser. To this end, we introduce a utility function that can access the above tradeoff. Based on this utility function, we define and study two social advertising problems: budgeted social advertising problem and unconstrained social advertising problem. In the first problem, we aim at selecting a set of seeds for each advertiser that maximizes the utility while setting budget constraints on the attention cost; in the second problem, we propose to optimize a linear combination of the utility and attention costs. We prove that both problems are NP-hard, and then develop constant factor approximation algorithms for both problems.","inCitations":["67dc19da49fb853308733413407aacf06333bb44","2716e2a8f31288a2f402d6dfb886a4a79c5a9829","bed099c8862175a8f0256191a963fd48adb2226e","f90b09c978171c8e067a392eee5ee4924e820ee8","439976413a08b3683ac760c64d4670b731c23747","a61aa8409834b8fe832cc422a4af45371582b312","6aa80875a0f166b267016e8e74dc01d511af81e8"],"pmid":"","title":"Optimizing Ad Allocation in Social Advertising","journalPages":"1383-1392","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03235v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983834","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03235v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03235"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Expectation\u2013maximization algorithm","NP-hardness","Optimizing compiler","Social advertising (social relationships)","Social network","Utility"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3c4e5d8773e0897df1767c26a176b5cb43dad5e6","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","ec659aca3aabeeaf404a30982ef55489bad8aa5e","53bd06b86a3e2c510089fdd820e2a07d4d1dabbd","4f9e530f9d893585ddab7c38c60b07fab6b5dee0"],"id":"2308df24e9181b34f1c33feff434742cc0146742","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2308df24e9181b34f1c33feff434742cc0146742","authors":[{"name":"Shaojie Tang","ids":["1682309"]},{"name":"Jing Min Yuan","ids":["46196467"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983834"}

Novel analysis tools are needed to process these data and extract useful information. Such tools could aid in personalized medicine. As an example, we could identify the causes for a disease by comparing the genomes of people who have the disease and those who do not have this disease. Given that human variability happens due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we could focus our attention on these SNPs. Investigations that try to understand human variability using SNPs fall under genome-wide association study (GWAS). A crucial step in GWAS is the identification of the correlation between genotypes (SNPs) and phenotypes (i.e., characteristics such as the presence of a disease). This step can be modeled as the k-locus problem (where k is any integer). A number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature for this problem when k = 2. In this paper we present an algorithm for solving the 2-locus problem that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the previous best known algorithms.","inCitations":["97d182bbf88bbe52b8aa9d0a4d68a5614342e4c6","145bca4670d681f0182a9fa0159718a961839cbc"],"pmid":"","title":"Efficient Algorithms for the Two Locus Problem in Genome-Wide Association Study: Algorithms for the Two Locus Problem","journalPages":"2305-2310","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983685"],"entities":["Algorithm","LOCUS","Personalization","Spatial variability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6baaa949f76b6265b710166c63fc83a988aeec85","39fe9145195afa986c51c2150b184e1eabacdb48","0bfdd7fb60bb4959ac38fadca7dcfbf549dd5456","1382d99ad4ad7312f98300ae18d9ac9253513e24","02fcff1d8933803cb6aef99348063ea073e1a58b","27ae23bb8d284a1fa8c8ab24e23a72e1836ff5cc","0e380b844cd414dadd2d326a4e2c4b5bae28033e","c942d74130edfbd0fcd67ad4745767e9fc4f8286","b9f2364494904c78069a9caeabf265edac5be816","45d6bdfb98ab56d12a3a9e5a393424de9705827e","5e41fdbd78f23fc6c6b7dfa60237230adaf90395","4e9ce288e8078b1794d6a92765260517b9b3f744","31d8af859539333758d42971841968194aae28e0","f065af6fc9da6acc65d345b2bc24086576d61f39","caf703f5d74e271a634b80a2c1fac55316ec1d15"],"id":"a103e23f9706f64fc91be35d7833bca3d84acb82","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a103e23f9706f64fc91be35d7833bca3d84acb82","authors":[{"name":"Sanguthevar Rajasekaran","ids":["1698923"]},{"name":"Subrata Saha","ids":["2213111"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983685"}

Automatic real-time text summarization has become an important tool for quickly transforming this overabundance of text into clear, useful information for end-users including affected individuals, crisis responders, and interested third parties. Despite the importance of real-time summarization systems, their evaluation is not well understood as classic methods for text summarization are inappropriate for real-time and streaming conditions.\n The TREC 2013-2015 Temporal Summarization (TREC-TS) track was one of the first evaluation campaigns to tackle the challenges of real-time summarization evaluation, introducing new metrics, ground-truth generation methodology and dataset. In this paper, we present a study of TREC-TS track evaluation methodology, with the aim of documenting its design, analyzing its effectiveness, as well as identifying improvements and best practices for the evaluation of temporal summarization systems.","inCitations":["1b0a3fca046dc667f425e0375cc3e5ded76bee49","adc72bed442cbe001440413c33cca1fd9267af5b","3f54376ec38aabf45502577922d7d1a21a6248ed","2c62d1cc9363dd1030a064cfde7472a25d00dc12"],"pmid":"","title":"A Study of Realtime Summarization Metrics","journalPages":"2125-2130","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/148597/1/148597.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983653"],"entities":["Automatic summarization","Best practice","Ground truth","Real-time clock","Real-time transcription","Social media","Software documentation","Temporal logic","Text corpus"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["24986435c73066aaea0b21066db4539270106bee","cfad182f567b6a6d54a4dd517e0122692afca9fb","8d1845b3c57d85c817f28a683c764e0ab18b5326","02868b2bc5a440568f01585547a10a81e4aa2286","7e05a693bf554733962e48e512f911953d9fd3d4","6feaade07f624c241d8f2f15c978658d522e2971","28a9b3848abcfd1e5b13bc0abb0c6c33b00a625d","46e01ee940b09077ea582cd9b689b7a2bcacfd57","2dcfbab048b397b42e955982b0fff94e4f64620d","255e97d82f528b613dbe8883727abfd14f3f9f39","63f3b9f6648285159053c3bd917463a91f40a763","19e8aaa1021f829c8ff0378158d9b69699ea4f83","eb2e558ff76cfbd9afa1f2b464c4779dd92a07f0","52d787212a293d1abe2b2d67c0678e94b295974b","6e8cae3c7a1f9b6572c8fb318efc43f48edd24e8","b550d628d4ead187cbb58875899392fe1667809c","5185297b4c2f0fcc00ec183b2dde1565fc963376"],"id":"765cd38945541271c69d35e09bd9edf5cc9911fb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/765cd38945541271c69d35e09bd9edf5cc9911fb","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Ekstrand-Abueg","ids":["2894648"]},{"name":"Richard McCreadie","ids":["1740893"]},{"name":"Virgil Pavlu","ids":["1682491"]},{"name":"Fernando Diaz","ids":["37064554"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983653"}

In this paper we propose for the first time an automated technique to extract and validate IOCs for web applications, by analyzing the information collected by a high-interaction honeypot. Our approach has several advantages compared with traditional techniques used to detect malicious websites. First of all, not all the compromised web pages are malicious or harmful for the user. Some may be defaced to advertise product or services, and some may be part of affiliate programs to redirect users toward (more or less legitimate) online shopping websites. In any case, it is important to detect these pages to inform their owners and to alert the users on the fact that the content of the page has been compromised and cannot be trusted. Also in the case of more traditional drive-by-download pages, the use of IOCs allows for a prompt detection and correlation of infected pages, even before they may be blocked by more traditional URLs blacklists. Our experiments show that our system is able to automatically generate web indicators of compromise that have been used by attackers for several months (and sometimes years) in the wild without being detected. So far, these apparently harmless scripts were able to stay under the radar of the existing detection methodologies \u2013 despite being hosted for a long time on public web sites.","inCitations":["25b4e498c2d37d1af6aac64850ad66e177d3515b","ce5335fe7f1e5abe3c3ff7f9949b06f3a47d68f0","e31123cac879e67a9e8d6901d02f1746d7c64674","5c2bba059f15e8d3cda8b091ec02e180b81a6d3c","502686e8fd5020e418ec7f383c761c3cb530e32b"],"pmid":"","title":"Automatic Extraction of Indicators of Compromise for Web Applications","journalPages":"333-343","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883056","http://www.eurecom.fr/en/publication/4792/download/sec-publi-4792.pdf"],"entities":["Affiliate marketing","Drive-by download","Experiment","Honeypot (computing)","Indicator of compromise","Malware","Online shopping","Radar","Redirection (computing)","Web application","Web page"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5626647d1718dfaf9c3d604e2e99b43b64813f92","2176706c2f2db4deb38030359e2c12f6952b651b","219a11f8034f5d1a60a5afee946f9df386b71b4d","051da9a3595d63de898482840cc668c2cd23f277","12f4f695491536ef4a3b9b1f9addb92b0cd2195b","06240b5f5a928d49b53e848bcbaa4bf7c6beab35","3032182c47b75d9c1d16877815dab8f8637631a2","17eceec10a0f5f3a3b2ce99309009bfb2e9ef389","dcc54065baf156332d18b2b9b2482690fb440d62","2f95e2ca11610cb334d8d777d7b0f0d5561e67bc","5fdd0425534afa3b255b890a25607030706a624c","49684028c0c3951a8940bfa118da1d85b9d12fa4","66fbc215a1e4d7a9854b962188125f80c22b1c96","dbe8dc8cde3b49703e29bfc94a19122b4e717b35","6d8c9fcce8177d6f8d122d653c7d32d7624d6714","0238bfd6a96479a45715423abaaedaa78a2e8b8a","090aca02c7faf914f8cab563065fca43f8aa6118","72e6daef18f93785c24b5f4010a2490c933e88ac","06945d2acf475ad6620d75eb561689dacbdceb35","8588b7cd66eba19efd97a85da79630d1fba476b5"],"id":"54866a30e3343c651cd33093f6c800871a44660b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/54866a30e3343c651cd33093f6c800871a44660b","authors":[{"name":"Onur Catakoglu","ids":["3353515"]},{"name":"Marco Balduzzi","ids":["1813573"]},{"name":"Davide Balzarotti","ids":["1706558"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872427.2883056"}

As a result, they usually lack systematic names for column headers and clear vocabulary for cell values. This limits the re-use of such tables and creates a huge heterogeneity problem when comparing or aggregating multiple tables.\n This paper aims to overcome this problem by automatically canonicalizing header names and cell values onto concepts, classes, entities and uniquely represented quantities registered in a knowledge base.\n To this end, we devise a probabilistic graphical model that captures coherence dependencies between cells in tables and candidate items in the space of concepts, entities and quantities. We give specific consideration to quantities which are mapped into a \"measure, value, unit\" triple over a taxonomy of physical (e.g. power consumption), monetary (e.g. revenue), temporal (e.g. date) and dimensionless (e.g. counts) measures.\n Our experiments with Web tables from diverse domains demonstrate the viability of our method and its benefits over baselines.","inCitations":["205606764288bfeae67cb76d2b598c72692933cf","1bd5866dd08522225b865019fc13f87f79c50404","8908019e133103fea16c9fc0f58c2a39ea40a779","d0d030ccebd669ed5faeca504091bbe5fff4aefb","ee50ab3b608d38c0c667024ff9d024e41dc229ca","36c283931b8d4c99d41d7ea010cefe972af7632a","c18eacfa672cf781ffe8b4757ac9abbf992a76a2","c7725540372d206a6e4333ba2170ab438c49ca70","ea70ba14b0d2f8aa2e73ac359bdfea49f990af4d","6e3ce6afa37fbb2a96b8d09355dbcc78dfe95af0","2a2e62a4b50fbd8d2bb0dbc51dd67beecea6e9c7","771ed7dc79e9490aaf9e2d0db7d7bf5ad81c641a","7a628a7e61904f7dca8757ca9205c08a325adf74","568b038d39be18aa58149b174693172ed334f0d1","aaa9d12640ec6f9d1d37333141c761c902d2d280"],"pmid":"","title":"Making Sense of Entities and Quantities in Web Tables","journalPages":"1703-1712","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983772"],"entities":["Algorithm","Directed acyclic graph","Entity","Experiment","Graphical model","HTML","Hoc (programming language)","Internet","Intranet","Knowledge base","Markov random field","Spreadsheet","Taxonomy (general)","Vocabulary","Wikipedia","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2b9cd09b949b7e69933d18ae408397e803987151","394f7ce9c36d4a5ca2c2868f2176336b42ad0cb0","58dfe569db2fc2e632869ef58e5d4c4ee66d7fad","1125b491d5169cd120a520a812e5f619e178f2bf","57166612b98f291b85bbcaaef0c1bdfa234935fc","924ce584acc148be29ef905c228fda7fe552c0c2","128d2482c0968cbd7639ecbe7dca97c11cf51570","4f410ab5c8b12b34b38421241366ee456bbebab9","515b9903cb55e548b6732e953a1bd51f457c6353","81f8706abcecfc748f2e27d6f7a92628036d6846","0b9dea9414a3acbd5d00e00541f917f96be68e19","8b468872cf915c98ff46a2bea4d2a34112b7b0b0","9b36aacc8434fcf82c998d83e050e253407ca4b2","1f990d98dcc3941f01bd6bb5405fbda37e00dd6a","07abd02f02774d178f26ca99937e5f94001a9ec9","c44cef69334cb62e6f6c7d0d245e1934f599815f","45e98175d9ceed16bdf1e7d2047b2738cbc0f4c2","3353af61c41db57afaca92e5990db39c9bd14f9f","a4df5ff749d823905ff9c1a23b522d3f426a1bb6","45b830bac3764a3c941f7b2bec905663ac9f24f0","187c25de08261760cf48b4e9dabf308d2f7f15d9","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","ad40e2f53f7112f4d2177df99fe5df47e2028541","4e262bec091f152d2ec51420aa881495b36cafbb","a38cd38da57c638574c00101edb04a78394f9aeb","513167c08db5139162710aad9b2c217b344df2c4","4f99a1cb0a248e08b5824ea5eb842a62cd552c32","33b94ba1d8b02f05d42954025798210867a833b7","5029918d406db6c4e008d5194891e3561c5734a7"],"id":"2132af47c82d5722b86747dfe3a9d7cf9e0bb4e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2132af47c82d5722b86747dfe3a9d7cf9e0bb4e1","authors":[{"name":"Yusra Ibrahim","ids":["38432231"]},{"name":"Mirek Riedewald","ids":["1722086"]},{"name":"Gerhard Weikum","ids":["1751591"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983772"}

Advertisements are typically ranked based on their expected revenue that is computed as the product between their predicted probability of being clicked (i.e., namely clickability) and their advertiser provided bid. The relevance of an advertisement to a user query is implicitly captured by the predicted clickability of the advertisement, assuming that relevant advertisements are more likely to attract user clicks. However, this approach easily biases the ranking toward advertisements having rich click history. This may incorrectly lead to showing irrelevant advertisements whose clickability is not accurately predicted due to lack of click history. Another side effect consists of never giving a chance to new advertisements that may be highly relevant to be printed due to their lack of click history. To address this problem, we explicitly measure the relevance between an advertisement and a query without relying on the advertisement's click history, and present different ways of leveraging this relevance to improve user search experience without reducing search engine revenue. Specifically, we propose a machine learning approach that solely relies on text-based features to measure the relevance between an advertisement and a query. We discuss how the introduced relevance can be used in four important use cases: pre-filtering of irrelevant advertisements, recovering advertisements with little history, improving clickability prediction, and re-ranking of the advertisements on the final search result page. Offine experiments using large-scale query logs and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority of the proposed click-oblivious relevance model and the important roles that relevance plays in sponsored search.","inCitations":["55b8aad107b4115d1e63564e743609f1c92746fa","062f4dc3b0cf80a341c6e4317a4e2c73166fdb0c","445a5d5f2a67e48b2c34a73cba46a1018e9d1c61"],"pmid":"","title":"The Role of Relevance in Sponsored Search","journalPages":"185-194","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983840"],"entities":["A/B testing","Digital history","Experiment","Machine learning","Printing","Relevance","Search engine marketing","Text-based (computing)","Web search engine","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7f578e7480d1de0b3b4f6c4fed0d707572f04c69","b72fbc0f1796ab91b6d1103e3c9a720e386ee6d9","697346625c5cd8484186f873221c948e4136c29a","00bbfde6af97ce5efcf86b3401d265d42a95603d","60c2115e94b6a9dd25e7e745af0e8f75b71d86c1","22562a15409361f776e4c82d98a8fc51317c50fd","25045b29dd0cfa7abe493fdf1dcf0b488f014065","6382439ed673285e0df541c94cb81a4417f88b99","1ff88585ce3fd5fdaab6573722d4874641359951","27db63ab642d9c27601a9311d65b63e2d2d26744","221b42bb9b7fb5fb54ed22c22f9f025a1aed74aa","2a738a4ea894874b408533f3d7452f1e1e1b1ef2","daf9ed5dc6c6bad5367d7fd8561527da30e9b8dd","23ba229478df2f6cba5279d4bb4d746c37c47c56","72b92aedb37fe7a3b0db95ad14475375546550b1"],"id":"c61f196f4d1aa3043a5bcc7dffe018a193f3d934","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c61f196f4d1aa3043a5bcc7dffe018a193f3d934","authors":[{"name":"Luca Maria Aiello","ids":["2905635"]},{"name":"Ioannis Arapakis","ids":["2646401"]},{"name":"Ricardo A.

Different statistical models (e.g. Poisson, geometric) are used to model the distribution of non-informative terms, producing different DFR models. An informative term is then detected by measuring the divergence of its distribution from the distribution of non-informative terms. However, there is little empirical evidence that the distributions of non-informative terms used in DFR actually fit current datasets. Practically this risks providing a poor separation between informative and non-informative terms, thus compromising the discriminative power of the ranking model. We present a novel extension to DFR, which first detects the best-fitting distribution of non-informative terms in a collection, and then adapts the ranking computation to this best-fitting distribution. We call this model Adaptive Distributional Ranking (ADR) because it adapts the ranking to the statistics of the specific dataset being processed each time. Experiments on TREC data show ADR to outperform DFR models (and their extensions) and be comparable in performance to a query likelihood language model (LM).","inCitations":["f3a8aff0929431ca21d2f5cb3dacd3a2b32f24c8","8ff7f47ef653603b6f65c128627c280ca1026dba"],"pmid":"","title":"Adaptive Distributional Extensions to DFR Ranking","journalPages":"2005-2008","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2983323.2983895","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00969v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00969","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00969v1.pdf"],"entities":["Computation","Divergence-from-randomness model","Information","Language model","Randomness","Statistical model","Text Retrieval Conference","Text corpus"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3257cfb4bb041efe583a3c80e4491419d8852275","73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","8f3e8a99eff5862e02413028ad265d1be06772bb","4f09e6ec1b7d4390d23881852fd7240994abeb58","eeacaa8b3b55ffd984a6dd36c17c46f83a2ed168","ae0067338dff4e6b48b6b798776ec88a6c242aae","0fe16f0424e32a849b48ca87e37e5bb2817aec6d","628f008c05f64567a1bffc4e00fd4c2378bb2fb7","0eefc8acf6c56006b15e46a42039f666d393193f","22d1e8ecaf4b42cd761aecbaf736190a6e680470","49eab5e19bf756c04c4c435643a82872d8132fef","4ab2cfe6766a5007b2fcf8cfffbf7fb566c077f4","59c18c974b47cbd27865544fba707d3fbfd5617b","580bac240c8f2509c12de3cc850ef24deef5779b","af777130dcd810eac080e86e25f5f47b88854e31","b234b49f38b891a1203f8ac1baba6924f561beac","7459b48ba2361bd053bc572eee68f5de442c5e4c"],"id":"53f1a0d55c841880a071a0f066dfa05163063c5b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/53f1a0d55c841880a071a0f066dfa05163063c5b","authors":[{"name":"Casper Petersen","ids":["8304471"]},{"name":"Jakob Grue Simonsen","ids":["1707651"]},{"name":"Kalervo Järvelin","ids":["2768186"]},{"name":"Christina Lioma","ids":["1784800"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983895"}

To this end, we propose the use of block-level features inferred from the audio signal to model music content. We show that these features outperform timbral and chromatic features previously used for the task. On the other hand, we investigate a variety of strategies to construct web-based predictors from web pages related to music pieces. We assess different parameters for this kind of predictors (e.g., number of web pages considered) and define a confidence threshold for prediction. Fusing the proposed audioand web-based methods by a weighted Borda rank aggregation technique, we show on a previously used dataset of music from 33 countries around the world that the median placing error can be reduced from 1,815 to 0 kilometers using K-nearest neighbor regression.","inCitations":["0a100cb8a1accb69905374ef35c13f36c073873e"],"pmid":"","title":"Fusing Web and Audio Predictors to Localize the Origin of Music Pieces for Geospatial Retrieval","journalPages":"322-334","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/af56/dbf060b4352ddeb572b45f7d36d164f5f722.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.cp.jku.at/people/schedl/Research/Publications/pdf/schedl_ecir_2016.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_24"],"entities":["Information retrieval","K-nearest neighbors algorithm","Location awareness","Web application","Web page","Web resource"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["50476adda8a1701242ca6eb7e1ec085b7bd0138e","a9685ed2eea0728626699bafee60758769a1f1e7","137d6ee88c6d31a1ac662bfe51d527b0c8e217c2","7b53b986eca20174b60677a456443ce70a080479","72038464e1dae58559728d8e4655ed8f5ec5fa4d","143a5104e735579a7b608839eb730142eb4f6971","2509f77e5ba197a471fa0492100cdfa55badd13e","1fce8a8b6cda9d2c1b4324d6c70e379857d4ac6b","4fe8abea6aae2e362c525734f8fc3758a8c490d3","14d0531b2bc51a0ecce107dedf4154025280cba5","182684f4b74307d20292e42968a8205e6573540d","03cac29d5b910b90991108cf160353edc16b1b7f","b19077f8792f4ab7e390a8344e8b32accb94bc0f","0234029e491f6ddf05f2ca5482c337d8cf303166","270c147c9b651a2e85e795675f80afed2c54c5fb","67a77d3242a357571541d39c26d305c5dda89445","a7480e7fddfc9acea3a5729f453c96ed7e93e5ad","669f0b2bdb95a858b9b6a967b39d2b61721f2918","181691e52481fb1e7b95d93d9229da3745f39b32","47484ae7e7af0d38f80f1fe60c7c068ee292fe60","5e226f669cc1dccda90220ddfc942d7db19db69a"],"id":"af56dbf060b4352ddeb572b45f7d36d164f5f722","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/af56dbf060b4352ddeb572b45f7d36d164f5f722","authors":[{"name":"Markus Schedl","ids":["1697822"]},{"name":"Fang Zhou","ids":["31679477"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_24"}

Finally, we use experiments from the Interactive Matching track of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) 2015 to assess the impact of errors in alignment validation, and how systems cope with them as function of their services.","inCitations":["4559821f9014062009d1e24b24d1eba8e4f0f7a9","663fa058b17f10c10533096e34a74d781fcdf3f5","ec59a6d0f1536fe6e9edf89dd3b9000c84ae1cba","88b08d21c5871f157ddff0177536fc02b5b5ba0e","c9979c71f496e5a421b8924ad2a2a9a86ca31cc2","fb544f31dab2ca1caf09043881ef40ed0d59cea3","72168f4b1fa64a7d350279cdcb788e24bbe8f0bc","0af095d68110440d466596f364ec5af94c47efea","3b2b6bd724926a419161eb0169035b92c5546b0c","6803110d68f86ed2d357004e6a2ed0396b872304","441b178ffd4130011e48e1d5c8acec13c96abf69","a714656bfdacd0a16faa794fe32aa308f4f95e84","6609ed522e271192abeee30956e2fcd7abcd4790","d94228909fadcbb4110c1de574544221f04455ae","ecf99ea25a49eea7b189c757a87f02247664a5b4","36f39c4cd4783a18f8cfe46c2725ca552db11b7c","becfba65ac4824c9800b7297a46865354fb0ccc1","977697f1e2c1d4d0cbfdfec256dbd0dbe644890e"],"pmid":"","title":"User Validation in Ontology Alignment","journalPages":"200-217","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d618/6bc0d99d5d67751af3158dd031386efe7ce7.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.ida.liu.se/~patla00/publications/ISWC16-preprint.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_13","http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1033537/FULLTEXT02.pdf","http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/8268/oaei-user-interactive-track.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Best practice","Binary classification","Data validation","Experiment","Extrapolation","Interaction","Knowledge engineering","Limited availability","Negative feedback","Ontology (information science)","Ontology alignment","Sequence alignment","Software propagation","Usability","User interface design"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5b82093e7acf94e6085ca47bd5bcff99c07c15e3","73cd9b74cdda37ff15ce1989d4c79e923294a732","f87a888c963a454505716a7cf6b89b98866d849a","1a83996166f4161efd2b836305396bd6bdea57cc","48cb72bfe02e73392b597c9285d79d6392786391","5803b46dd6e835ba494cbbe1a2999a2f8d0cb87e","61ab1f4cd2a6c6b4514b7a96f437a7903ff77efe","06be6eb9585d070c979f89ae19fe84fe4ab355a1","34cfe79ebacf55af186c4bd1682a6bbd97074e8d","19b15a388df59823a141adc939edbf8399acadd2","215f6290ae24284f8f2b141267f895346f8350fd","6e964849b0f8334c0905d6ea8cac6beefbbd8939","69c73fb9ddab594fc85193c56fbb7e0fb3ec70b3","c96f0b75eabfdf1797b69ac3a92487b45c2d9855","33f24ed693537ff5f8af3dc0b4defb21a41cc641","6bb52100d7da8655eeae36dca21c3abecf151272","2cf60517f1e639dd50619b9f6937b99b0da0de32","1e2281603c94b690db0df65d09779e6ea5470114","93a963407dc109b584be4907e94fcab3abfbc06b","6ab2e2383e2e0f40eed29a85b4b4c6c7d1bc1318","396e8c578c5ba53d264bb7e4329e0d0725df23f1","720c2042d3ddff66110f83045bf3fefc55943e17","1a2c6843b9e781f2f77e875f3d073ab686f6fae3","364baf554bcf6c9960b1730e6a36b20be956678b","d144e84512c49006f09ff109720a21353720a586","21d03fbcd8598a4653d579504c9f8d2f2789e7f5","3e5bc185a74d5cfc3e576d17a5d1b63b7593b82d","39f4757209ae338af430648d1a178068c22097db","4b838ed7a1d5779df10493df90ff57fbfb549ba2","77afa030baf8916d36b2d243c0f98d7cdafd83fd","451dba2fa26cb95b678dcae43b6c1299a2cb3661","dc91b7137a2caf343f3fcfe01e8d3eb6f774c9d7","9811ffb5adebbd0037bf48644cd52379ea101380","96c6d79d91354fa6647abac7de627dfe8d077891","63b68664c19f7796ecfe9174ae961b8b9a380e58","4e452979ba51fd171c001367c22cd303bf9b240b","070beb71c4f91ced107c7ebf207d353215d3b1b1","4b4afd45404d2fd994c5bd0fb79181e702594b61","c018a6cb1d3980cf935d7b30e6fe89d458497e89","d193d74587de77a882e09ade5fe2158bc1a4a55f","8539dfc92c9b8804461be1e225bd48eb3867fac1","3f352f7fe973e4c2382a53a46bdce2da73413cf3","a9da4033a41ec961063840957448b7a9bdf80f54","740ce07385d81c3e9ba1de0cfbe3a775b498d347"],"id":"405ac46a467128219f5270adab44183928c56f53","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/405ac46a467128219f5270adab44183928c56f53","authors":[{"name":"Zlatan Dragisic","ids":["2443598"]},{"name":"Valentina Ivanova","ids":["13915475"]},{"name":"Patrick Lambrix","ids":["1793342"]},{"name":"Daniel Faria","ids":["2829594"]},{"name":"Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz","ids":["1689236"]},{"name":"Catia Pesquita","ids":["3246706"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_13"}

Within this learning, we investigate the spectral k-support norm, a more appealing convex relaxation than the popular nuclear norm, as a low rank penalty in this paper. Despite the better recovering performance, the spectral k-support norm entails the model difficult to be optimized efficiently, which severely limits its scalability from the practical perspective. Therefore, this paper proposes a scalable and efficient algorithm which considers the dual objective of the original problem that can take advantage of the more computational efficient linear oracle of the spectral k-support norm to be evaluated. Further, by studying the sub-gradient of the loss of the dual objective, a line-search strategy is adopted in the algorithm to enable it to adapt to the Holder smoothness. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the superior prediction performance and computation efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","inCitations":["8ae26775f5b4c2318b45fc907669268ff66be439","b849ca8452504add86edbeff56c323579f1b8e4f"],"pmid":"","title":"Scalable Spectral k-Support Norm Regularization for Robust Low Rank Subspace Learning","journalPages":"1151-1160","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983738"],"entities":["Algorithm","Computation","Computer vision","Data mining","Experiment","Gradient","Line search","Linear programming relaxation","Matrix regularization","Modulus of smoothness","Oracle machine","Scalability","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["131b706b7cb3041cfb3930b705f865baa7ad5904","23bbea130398331084021cc895a132064219b4b1","bcf48b5e76c7e22335c6820f0de0abe8c5f708b5","0c65d69b4939e565c27439fdf077596bee6848d5","5d3a0eba8e82853c28e315003e131811ebd18143","586636a3709d32b45d02ccfa9656baa012ee69f2","06b6881bf3d7835bebd06f4feeb4706dba5b7257","21a9f713a664374bfdcca6f4c8f267b85e63ad7a","035eb0de9be331ed1152d6d60686c20a693b54ed","9f6a3844158c36ab9f8cd9be4429da52ec404573","7bf96c44d65c6d6ba099e161e281362dd13e0123","153cd6650fe994a368b7096f2140059c0628a0ae","46217f372a75dddc2254fdbc6b9418ba3554e453","1b65af0b2847cf6edb1461eda659f08be27bc76d","aea4128ba18689ff1af27b90c111bbd34013f8d5","a8199bf500e10fd346304873c54f86c51f5957aa","23eb770557fab70ec82b635b6ad27877931da7b4","3300f32fde17daf1aaa0c7d6ecc6fffa2d3669bd","bdfb35517be890b6b071c580d5d56d4f542d2b29","362ec67720d79b07c159377fa6427c6785d10a01","613a25ea8049c9f6f25f87599a6c2977eb2e4606","32c47ac0708fa13e68b751b203b2c0ac5f851112","2582ba3b7ca215f1ab98c6dbcc0190f754c54059","b41400ffcef0a54c9dd734b1241a94d675bb6f1b","0f7758c3edc759f5d81f1e5f0ef160eea5f836ef","4006448d5b8ca4d9ff9ce138e9d756517e14ec35","1d82f73dff699205abdf4f613fc617ddd21683b9","77544bc31faf4c83cd55fbe512d1724f1ad5c0cb","0c15be9f60c1fa4bf769f575e4e80ff71ffd5362","54aafe33c4a32fb5875d04fd4a6e6da50920c263","a3efddec3b162cafe93b4aedd161cf67175ac051","63d440eb606c7aa4ee3c7fcd94d65af3f5c92c96"],"id":"bd7b51d8fda2ee360147ce24b2cd2688e5256b70","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd7b51d8fda2ee360147ce24b2cd2688e5256b70","authors":[{"name":"Yiu-ming Cheung","ids":["1804445"]},{"name":"Jian Lou","ids":["39067021"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983738"}

However the manual work required to identify these 'innovations' is both time consuming and subjective. In this work we demonstrate how such innovations in language can be identified across two different OSN's (Online Social Networks) through the operationalisation of known language acceptance models that incorporate relatively simple statistical tests. From grounding our work in language theory, we identified three statistical tests that can be applied - variation in; frequency, form and meaning. Each show different success rates across the two networks (Geo-bound Twitter sample and a sample of Reddit). These tests were also applied to different community levels within the two networks allowing for different innovations to be identified across different community structures over the two networks, for instance: identifying regional variation across Twitter, and variation across groupings of Subreddits, where identified example innovations included 'casualidad' and 'cym'.","inCitations":["d49ab9cd3cd01602746ba361bc34a24bc076919f","f31b28ed7f7bf464ba9dfb67dfece64a71e4b330","3c3102c80f9f5c0f9a63456982ed89b11f353937","a00907767d33835d6d714bfaf487c06a0a773b20","293350996154a2a5b0c893c0d15ce7431c21b5c8","464e40375248f8b59331c19949594e71e4711812"],"pmid":"","title":"Towards Modelling Language Innovation Acceptance in Online Social Networks","journalPages":"553-562","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/21665/3/Kershaw%20rowe%20stacey%20ACM_proc.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2835776.2835784","http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/76720/1/ACM_proc.pdf","http://ai2-s2-pdf-tmp.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdf60.pdf"],"entities":["Dictionary","Lexicon","Modeling language","Online and offline","Protologism"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["fbefba9de2a6b8a0756d6adda4b0b69ab3126469","24281c886cd9339fe2fc5881faf5ed72b731a03e","5be43ef849329a54cd0c01e1432ab5e21517820e","87d696d7dce4fed554430f100d0f2aaee9f73bc5","4ab74b69ddbd17d7a0995afec5e8665a01b8d8e4","3f80e497f7bf4f4ed05a1a5f023896899d3b2df6","641fd689e687e065d733eb46fe96ff184108aba1","3cfe6bd00226905e021bf815573580ad9b4f16fa","3d374ceaac0cfeab0f9a645e8a40d7b6edef969a","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","c4d41e8170164f7cf24af88078bf5505b46939e7","db0ec9345b4e9e0fb6e3d8523846df98eb15f29b","1336146e7f95b295bb73c7659c6af4befd86cbdd","03efbbf1c8fa661f31fe94efcc894ad95eeff3e2","5638ed7791cfffc9132ed63a19bb3826384b7826","2a9d787cbe29806bc05f5b0085cd3680dddb0455","e6e6c9ee403049dc885cfa645a356f06b7a934af","3145fc2e5cbdf877ef07f7408dcaee5e44ba6d4f","14901e85c44edc1a59b9d76477d6b177c07b76a4","2e2abcd603f247ee635713b1c0e0bcedd63a2e85","30e69288d6d427da250e395d4341b481d8f600f5","0400e9cc3be492ad42e11432bf9a16651dcf3bec","3f0debdbd17811775012e24a51f7e7fd37ae42c4","ce668a88e34dc8df1a95c7292688413274b8ed0b","27682a8a4e49d7a025299d4e0d9ea722819b6e01"],"id":"20699d5da7fd8284261b4e2363118702fa5d3b9f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/20699d5da7fd8284261b4e2363118702fa5d3b9f","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Kershaw","ids":["2930544"]},{"name":"Matthew Rowe","ids":["21476238"]},{"name":"Patrick Stacey","ids":["34790998"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2835776.2835784"}

In this paper, we propose a key class of hybrid parallel graphlet algorithms that leverages multiple CPUs and GPUs simultaneously for computing k-vertex induced subgraph statistics (called graphlets). In addition to the hybrid multi-core CPU-GPU framework, we also investigate single GPU methods (using multiple cores) and multi-GPU methods that leverage all available GPUs simultaneously for computing induced subgraph statistics. Both methods leverage GPU devices only, whereas the hybrid multi-core CPU-GPU framework leverages all available multi-core CPUs and multiple GPUs for computing graphlets in large networks. Compared to recent approaches, our methods are orders of magnitude faster, while also more cost effective enjoying superior performance per capita and per watt. In particular, the methods are up to 300 times faster than a recent state-of-the-art method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage multiple CPUs and GPUs simultaneously for computing induced subgraph statistics.","inCitations":["320e619aab57d9f042fe81b9cae24d83b6b3f429","a960d4405a1aea8807154a7d91b9a96391078bfe"],"pmid":"","title":"Leveraging Multiple GPUs and CPUs for Graphlet Counting in Large Networks","journalPages":"1783-1792","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983832","http://ryanrossi.com/pubs/rossi-et-al-cikm16-Hybrid-Multi-GPU-CPU-Graphlets.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Central processing unit","Graphics processing unit","Induced subgraph","Multi-core processor"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6d290b8bdc256c7bee2fae0e0a081ee0b7794bf3","9f82001048320f27ca93f74653ff933b3e8bb963","ca866a27cd07555a0027d92663421869d0ae4439","97a6a139ee5e6f31f1d9769f1deca28b8b2ec0b6","00e6e43ac1021d42d82bf82b026973c0f578de20","93ee8e1c05d11d63aa3d61653b2c8bae75e0aecd","8bbafbcc56b8bf11e5580ecf8f768d96a1752518","1332fc6b04f3484e922c9fe877b0793ac3224fc8","05be14f166ae78c924528eba3faab922267db79f","de07e796c8d53c6ecc25b95565688aa9a9b5a213","025e224cf0f12f772c7efba4f7c6b769a2bf298b","1d6320a672b866444737880cee8a980f5cca6864","1f3da8690226525187cbb3c8fb0666d625ce7435","23daca4fc12c49af4c427acb529b00bafee809f5","c81f633bf5a4aa68e946bbd30dcc36e25d267008","ce69fde1bcc7e49dfc1a1df76426fdf287983bff","53a4f0959ddcde4524ca54e9df272cc1039a73a4","79a920e110080b066d9aef6744f110b04fc77a31","11830978703daeb7775678372558ac2a15476187","f68a0859ff4329d8423d3ad58f91076dced89ee5","0d8bed4acf7d94a3cf4ea9a57ae0effeae76d408","6a92a251be77883b26a535c69ebbc872d0479edc","1dd2384fee50fab2361a859710889e3d0f8cb37e","24789ad83f6d993743d26c2588cb1a0538eb34ba","895dc47f818b7f842fda9c1963d8d630c1d9744f","38dad8ef8d98aa81c9072c905ce851d33916bfca"],"id":"6e0f1d8dc9131991ae1f21f2491d0a6326f7e727","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6e0f1d8dc9131991ae1f21f2491d0a6326f7e727","authors":[{"name":"Ryan A.

It can be modeled by dueling bandits, a mathematical model for online learning under limited feedback from pairwise comparisons. Comparisons of pairs of rankers is performed by interleaving their result sets and examining which documents users click on. The dueling bandits model addresses the key issue of which pair of rankers to compare at each iteration.\n Methods for simultaneously comparing more than two rankers have recently been developed. However, the question of which rankers to compare at each iteration was left open. We address this question by proposing a generalization of the dueling bandits model that uses simultaneous comparisons of an unrestricted number of rankers.\n We evaluate our algorithm on standard large-scale online ranker evaluation datasets. Our experimentals show that the algorithm yields orders of magnitude gains in performance compared to state-of-the-art dueling bandit algorithms.","inCitations":["26a6fbcea178d19c1b35c6fd6626513b18e32228","ddd084ba70b3a2581f26fc31bb82baf2949cc8f0","10cd2383c7d9b42a62c950ed62a86fa6b04a33e0","a26641f4641887f00de4a6c933fd70af0862c810","7bf5f0d97d9e0f968ba896a045d51461db7da4ef","8ff7f47ef653603b6f65c128627c280ca1026dba","31943f1f383a4ca6ba86e172a0c9f26c901f9401","f2eef42ffc74c5f4b083026298e728e9b22264d8"],"pmid":"","title":"Multi-Dueling Bandits and Their Application to Online Ranker Evaluation","journalPages":"2161-2166","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06253","http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ingemar/Content/papers/2016/CIKM2016.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2983323.2983659"],"entities":["Algorithm","Forward error correction","Iteration","Lazy evaluation","Mathematical model","Multi-armed bandit"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27f7e9ff722cad915ba228dce80aa51d883c8e9f","3630af46b507fe6c42856c7ec77e1b0af3c5b7d6","8414a5f5964e504c680022200a490f7f63ec759c","3e6a2ec424a8d7229298ffe4cd2343ae56361176","308b5fcaefe248d30027aed80b2a7288167bf027","565999f3e656cf6d4ccab54eca9121b85599ecb7","8a9f5e61c6c977cdacd85d9a7b14153026619505","ab0463d8aef96697ad0e4d2c86fd1b41ffd4633d","10468b38072f70cad77109441c73f5f470da33f9","1d81f37488a6c492d5dd2733d485c9b014e9eeb4","37993ca5320cce27abe3af56dffe1ac20bf29e62","933334cd73c452613daa302c887c38c577afe658","1b3c86ad6c149941750d97bd72b6b0122c1d8b5e","36bf2f8f9afb90a8172d411934bb86294f4f520e","3a53576ca90389a43209a094933c68dc3a90acff","407eb2355f698847dc7129bc1ba085376e5b3553","2bd2b3f68caa4f13c14e2fd8326d9602dec5c10d"],"id":"2d7e2dee276dcedc0d3d65d44a67cb801f9e0747","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2d7e2dee276dcedc0d3d65d44a67cb801f9e0747","authors":[{"name":"Brian Brost","ids":["26482429"]},{"name":"Yevgeny Seldin","ids":["3290824"]},{"name":"Ingemar J.

Yet users often want to monitor developing news stories based on an event, rather than by examining an exhaustive list of retrieved documents. In this work, we illustrate a news retrieval system, eventNews, and an underlying algorithm which is event-centric. Through this system, news articles are clustered around a single news event or an event and its sub-events. The algorithm presented can leverage the creation of new Reuters stories and their compact labels as seed documents for the clustering process. The system is configured to generate top-level clusters for news events based on an editorially supplied topical label, known as a \u2018slugline,\u2019 and to generate sub-topic-focused clusters based on the algorithm. The system uses an agglomerative clustering algorithm to gather and structure documents into distinct result sets. Decisions on whether to merge related documents or clusters are made according to the similarity of evidence derived from two distinct sources, one, relying on a digital signature based on the unstructured text in the document, the other based on the presence of named entity tags that have been assigned to the document by a named entity tagger, in this case Thomson Reuters\u2019 Calais engine.

There have been several attempts to predict difficulty, both automatically and manually; but without high accuracy at a pre-retrieval stage. In this paper, we focus rather on understanding Why a query is perceived by humans as difficult. We ran two separated but related experiments in which we asked humans to provide both a query difficulty prediction and reasons to explain their prediction. Results show that: (i) reasons can be categorized into 4 classes; (ii) reasons can be framed into closed questions to be answered on a Likert scale; and (iii) some reasons correlate in a coherent way with the human predicted numerical difficulty. On the basis of these results it is possible to derive hints to be provided to help users when formulating their queries and to avoid them to rely on their wrong perception of difficulty.","inCitations":["342aa7e26b4aa47657c20ec0fa0c0ad4a0c1179d","b3c52fa86ba1ae6629d23c2386c53f1ce90f725c","ab132d6ce7e4ea05a1dca1baeb8393d80cac9a5d","4712bd2ec1ab62d1472a57d28e063e66962e46d4"],"pmid":"","title":"Why do you Think this Query is Difficult?: A User Study on Human Query Prediction","journalPages":"1073-1076","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://www.irit.fr/publis/SIG/2016_SIGIR_MM.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914696"],"entities":["Categorization","Coherence (physics)","Experiment","Numerical analysis","Query language","Usability testing"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["db4a680ad6027e94214678c4ba8b9a398632eada","628dd3515c500ab8683639042dd78ff5c8b42ed5","6d25a34dd852280c0b10a9b6f753881b6e56eef1","b9304167cb665c86908d4a76d274560cd100640c","eca4fe9e8200e8f6a19dd2a4a11859f21b0fb940","fd39848add469fff531d8563ac479ddf6b01f5c9","f3f79d10e21cfbd41c5f7e6bf655f39263206add"],"id":"544d6844d8d2aaa9b7fe8ccc7b96cfa92b8cbd40","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/544d6844d8d2aaa9b7fe8ccc7b96cfa92b8cbd40","authors":[{"name":"Stefano Mizzaro","ids":["1726978"]},{"name":"Josiane Mothe","ids":["1707022"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2914696"}

A shortlist is a temporary list of candidates that the user is currently considering, e.g., a list of a few movies the user is currently considering for viewing. From a cognitive perspective, shortlists serve as digital short-term memory where users can offload the items under consideration \u2013 thereby decreasing their cognitive load. From a machine learning perspective, adding items to the shortlist generates a new implicit feedback signal as a by-product of exploration and decision making which can improve recommendation quality. Shortlisting therefore provides additional data for training recommendation systems without the increases in cognitive load that requesting explicit feedback would incur. We perform an user study with a movie recommendation setup to compare interfaces that offer shortlist support with those that do not. From the user studies we conclude: (i) users make better decisions with a shortlist; (ii) users prefer an interface with shortlist support; and (iii) the additional implicit feedback from sessions with a shortlist improves the quality of recommendations by nearly a factor of two.","inCitations":["0f61f7ed73c93e3a98cfc8cde1a5bdc252918226","4808983e383fe095e7fab90d96ddb2013b64f769","009adb4131a9c649c552e32c9e66c9cbb9fb4722","ff7feb602e827625cbfd576ebc2f6ad3141e5843","4e5592a19eab030938b228e934b3dc162f5cc6d9","c30467dd8a55a3d0577e43b979383da0f15c56f9","9c8d5fb3410e47c86501dc7afbc1b04c696ef6da","603ceb5f315d9b35354df8c06a0afc96382f45a3","205d237f915f118c378575006c6e323c346198ac","ee8d8aa9cee75ac5d5e759cdd1b5299b5f153ea0","244778e41929602fcb2651dbc363d5e06bc637bb","e6a263ce513bddea04ebbf7a864c29a6fb2e89ee","9f712949c058f9e653669e6c843ed33907063ece"],"pmid":"","title":"Using Shortlists to Support Decision Making and Improve Recommender System Performance","journalPages":"987-997","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~schnabts/downloads/slides/schnabel2016shortlists.pdf","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07545","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/publications/schnabel_etal_16a.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~schnabts/downloads/schnabel2016shortlists.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07545v2.pdf","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbennett/papers/www-2016-shortlists.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07545v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07545v2.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/schnabel_etal_16a.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883012","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Using-Shortlists-to-Support-Decision-Making-and-Improve-Recommender-System-Performance.pdf","http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/proceedings/p987.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07545","http://susandumais.com/WWW2016__Shortlists__camera_ready_final.pdf"],"entities":["Downstream (software development)","Feedback","Holism","IBM Notes","Machine learning","Recommender system","Usability testing","Widget (GUI)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["00cbb42367566a70e3c541d93b5873565b9b1288","06b704d57573141d6fcdf8f6cb87ede26713459f","42a584da6b128399fda9c1cca772045c55b70eb4","172a9d150372423000b13b2f1e4b96c8096c956a","925977d4aaa1bab9463f51579781ce3106137e97","1b70e5345a46776affd4154f0d2c0a4fdd381557","7bb717e24d3ebe7672dd4c5c87e4bb5549cb45bd","fdef42c26182c9556c8df7ee057b759d0429a156","175c1bb60ee46dac56d942ef8c7339977b4ebb0e","235cf387b1a597078c9d9c1cbc794dd1e37b8dc3","4023ae0ba18eed43a97e8b8c9c8fcc9a671b7aa3","9bb04953e719ae2819c52f16ceaa26aaea6aba2a","0768149ce1170691bcde8b4539153a282f0cc74c","61780edb89b3cfbd3bd13a01c26c1cf94e8a4d0d","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","67f80240c59285146803d5dbff81f10047ffc288","7ef4c4d7b8f3d820df55100e1c1232e74593fe21","5a34f91e15fcfe3daee523d33d165c746a4d589d","23a94ce42fe0d50f5c993f34d4c9602f8aeac507","9de2b00fc24747cbf74401ce19e3864191a81e9b","37f0376c3df720ddf005c61f71ea094abfcc0556","818826f356444f3daa3447755bf63f171f39ec47","f51820619ca42c5799f3c5acc3855671b905419c","3f30270e49fadd703afe7663a834c5640823abe5","e7d4792fded9602ccdf49f20b1f3d437a29c808f","d8237600841361f7811f5fd9effaed9d2e6e34b0","a5e9df7720e68359087b290e50f925d9cdb9036e"],"id":"18e5ec7150f7e73deb869b0a41e2fbbf730325e5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/18e5ec7150f7e73deb869b0a41e2fbbf730325e5","authors":[{"name":"Tobias Schnabel","ids":["48839531"]},{"name":"Paul N.

Both fields of study have also benefitted directly from developments in natural language processing (NLP), which have provided new tools and techniques to explore research problems in bibliometrics and IR. Digital libraries, with their full text, multimedia content, along with searching and browsing capabilities, represent ideal environments in which to investigate the mutually beneficial relationships that can be forged among bibliometrics, IR and NLP. This brief presentation highlights the symbiotic relationship that exists among bibliometrics, IR and NLP.","inCitations":["89b2a5ee0b7c516b0a04df053d114d36021ed583","5e0032a9587af824c8473c4448f95e52fd9f131c","a581806d34b3bd6a9fe390da2393c1ad15456a4e","45c0cd8a022442c803b75b8fc9b1ef8fb48ab0ee","055a758cea739f4c53336a69e667ab8d3f2ebabe","d9e86c035b2264fd19efd9bf04175dd55eab107a","10f84abbe3790146ce46619c162b92a192b7f6b7","bb54c51a0417fa0fdb146ba9dc55dc0e624383f6"],"pmid":"","title":"Bibliometrics, Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing: Natural Synergies to Support Digital Library Research","journalPages":"6-13","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2ac2/54c5174a536312cfebb2436ce6e27cbad827.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W16/W16-1501.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1610/paper1.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology//W/W16/W16-1501.pdf","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/attachments/W/W16/W16-1501.Presentation.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1501","http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-1501.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology//attachments/W/W16/W16-1501.Presentation.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-1501.pdf","http://anthology.aclweb.org/attachments/W/W16/W16-1501.Presentation.pdf","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/W/W16/W16-1501.pdf","http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/attachments/W/W16/W16-1501.Presentation.pdf","http://aclweb.org/anthology/attachments/W/W16/W16-1501.Presentation.pdf"],"entities":["Bibliographic database","Bibliometrics","Digital library","Information retrieval","Library (computing)","Natural language processing","Synergy","Systems design"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c5fabd99e47cf17f9bd9a4ff9c6b44433fb9f387","d30a037162aaefb940b3faeee071134aa07f3108","02b059b0e12a2eeaa8d4d84942d1d579d11cfd54","06ecdf1db424ac9678da32252a52cd9565538a59","2a8b8967a482db15869f49902fff2596e78c8e1b","18d016076c6423e9e4a11ff0196a9172fb65bfb7","30affdcced9df53667d288eb7708bfc06091abdd","73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","1fd05854fb509e37393e473490e059cac8abba99","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","e9f67115f2110e207823e394855f7e6ac34a2483","83ab0826b200ff49db41ac1b64f515cc6b6bba64","400811b3fb8e131f8e044e220c4ba3767d7b4fec","71bc86767eab58e0ed447b0fca00d0bc3e7b2962","f018b9121bcb6d849938fbfeaa8de3db94cd2696","4e02155729da96bfc13464adc2300d1ba1b9a86f","f0a764b074f889c200033e66d01943fd41778d09","520161e61c734f5c78fe8474e14426da1c658afc","0ef311acf523d4d0e2cc5f747a6508af2c89c5f7","39357471df8784a2103828da0710c48140c001d0","794de6e309c53ca4a096f56de2dce61fee4ab654","13e46f771d84d427756fde1058a95159f6ff1197","0cc59976f427699f11eeeaa447edec5972348975","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","ad52e5b2752611b51598f8f476dd8e598972d6d9","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","99f5d79da460a87b2fe802f3d70a83d58e4d0daf"],"id":"2ac254c5174a536312cfebb2436ce6e27cbad827","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ac254c5174a536312cfebb2436ce6e27cbad827","authors":[{"name":"Dietmar Wolfram","ids":["1722850"]}],"doi":""}

We propose an encoding approach to distill task-specific knowledge from a set of high-dimensional embeddings, so that we can reduce model complexity by a large margin as well as retain high accuracy, achieving a good compromise between efficiency and performance. Experiments reveal the phenomenon that distilling knowledge from cumbersome embeddings is better than directly training neural networks with small embeddings.","inCitations":["6337afe67dd416a21379431a36ae949e568c027e","074ba386e27adc3b536fd484600a19a86b62b9b4","a6a0946c91209001e6d179717f6a49126c836623","3066a1534da49d11ed43837588010030a690371b","662a302c49356f3808cdc51a7fd01c60cb4c7650","32a93598e8a338496f04a0ace81b0768c2ef059d"],"pmid":"","title":"Distilling Word Embeddings: An Encoding Approach","journalPages":"1977-1980","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983888","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04488v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04488v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04488v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04488"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Experiment","Natural language processing","Softmax function","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27211ed68a7a00f1df0121fa1890a1b2acdd1a88","701d2c119733809f65311bc96733330b3ab59dce","edb1e4bd20731b292e36df7f80dc5c1ad61febb6","173920744d0a70a29f891466492576fbdd18ba03","4e88de2930a4435f737c3996287a90ff87b95c59","58842ca9adf0d3e5448bff08f5ede514c2a6b14d","74fc396d0b8ec548d600395182f12c9b06cc84e9","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","c255481725612359576e6d419913d0b5a6375be3","cd85a549add0c7c7def36aca29837efd24b24080","03ff3f8f4d5a700fbe8f3a3e63a39523c29bb60f","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","76327da3ad7f9c04b7c194ec78d30d11da5b4c34","4b9af9b9ed1bfb6b0688019d9fa79875bbcd8f3f","5c534f0c84c8d4cdf8618645043da421b7682753","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","1a07186bc10592f0330655519ad91652125cd907","bfea4d58717c83c67ac3f9eab855d15c59754757"],"id":"25e2708e31003b264abd4727b1029bbf7c61d180","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/25e2708e31003b264abd4727b1029bbf7c61d180","authors":[{"name":"Lili Mou","ids":["38956216"]},{"name":"Ran Jia","ids":["8243703"]},{"name":"Yan Xu","ids":["48615144"]},{"name":"Ge Li","ids":["46439321"]},{"name":"Lu Zhang","ids":["15525563"]},{"name":"Zhi Jin","ids":["1700880"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983888"}

To mitigate the violations, we proposed in previous work to validate the mappings which generate the data, instead of validating the generated data afterwards. In this work, we demonstrate how mappings validation is applied to dbpedia. dbpedia mappings are automatically translated to rml and validated by rdfunit. The dbpedia mappings assessment can be frequently executed, because it requires significantly less time compared to validating the dataset. The validation results become available via a user-friendly interface. The dbpedia community takes them into consideration to refine the dbpedia mappings or ontology and thus, increase the dataset quality.","inCitations":["73bbc70c2a71e10c56fa4c56b283bc7e537d4a7f"],"pmid":"","title":"DBpedia Mappings Quality Assessment","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6287/86f19b2ee36d7797b90708f58156bc5307e3.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8133269/file/8133271.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1690/paper97.pdf"],"entities":["Crostata","DBpedia","Usability","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["26d6f9a60e4dee8f752c5164b88b884fe40f472e","6a8c6a827a63a8f0d81045d682d0bf794cf177a2","4fa0d9c4c3d17458085ee255b7a4b7c325d59e32","1d77573d61f2ee107f25331a3dbe410d3d744419","cc88d3ea90449023874e7d5c257a3f3644ace023"],"id":"d0114a533b7b617c5e60114c36b63dd00e3829b6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d0114a533b7b617c5e60114c36b63dd00e3829b6","authors":[{"name":"Anastasia Dimou","ids":["1722023"]},{"name":"Dimitris Kontokostas","ids":["2627116"]},{"name":"Markus Freudenberg","ids":["36767711"]},{"name":"Ruben Verborgh","ids":["1723397"]},{"name":"Jens Lehmann","ids":["2841524"]},{"name":"Erik Mannens","ids":["1691320"]},{"name":"Sebastian Hellmann","ids":["2024066"]}],"doi":""}

Since sources' reliability is unknown a priori, a truth discovery method usually estimates sources' reliability along with the truth discovery process. A major limitation of existing truth discovery methods is that they commonly assume exactly one true value on each data item and therefore cannot deal with the more general case that a data item may have multiple true values (or multi-truth). Since the number of true values may vary from data item to data item, this requires truth discovery methods being able to detect varying numbers of truth values from the multi-source data. In this paper, we propose a multi-truth discovery approach, which addresses the above challenges by providing a generic framework for enhancing existing truth discovery methods. In particular, we redeem the numbers of true values as an important clue for facilitating multi-truth discovery. We present the procedure and components of our approach, and propose three models, namely the byproduct model, the joint model, and the synthesis model to implement our approach. We further propose two extensions to enhance our approach, by leveraging the implications of similar numerical values and values' co-occurrence information in sources' claims to improve the truth discovery accuracy. Experimental studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","inCitations":["a3b9014b22d7de8b4734ba58ef4c2a7285fb82f1","7f105ba51746e31dd30ac5637e2a4c0c85d40fb4","29a1406a840e43bb5e8a47191be0b6cdc26b7a31","56862217ee0dcab5ac7532dd746e7c525127ae22"],"pmid":"","title":"Empowering Truth Discovery with Multi-Truth Prediction","journalPages":"881-890","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983767"],"entities":["Algorithm","Data item","MTD-f","Multi-source","Numerical analysis","Overhead (computing)","Sensor","Source data"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4fd6f95aca0da395078d63c4f3be5a51f3ffef55","cd48760a142830b796b8a85a158cd469f3e5feb0","114b3aa3a4c2ceaa6b61630dc409be7604a75f77","41f1ebd4c8486614f5830794220df217281d507c","3982559b5c155846ad90d4df58929eb3261d9a1f","4607f09a348c87f95aedd7711b24d8bf614fe58c","579e1e9217cfed6d563cedf8f8fdcd1604fc0917","76f7824888d0b82d0d68ba893f2e04a2e26f4288","61dc7b3bcdff4e0fec03880ee079ae06f8fe32f9","121822b16a8b33378929b52506e24ec92cf74f8f","af2a807c5e32a35765850c6b6891f471d7bc7aea","d47aeb204c9e3b879893510ac2b66883a42cf86d","0e5ebc2eb31b6c78ee0dee10246efeeaf587f7f4","34aff134ba0d25b146721b35ec58a9c1c1abe2ac","a12cd3d9ae5530a90302a6e4af477e6e24fa0f95","779e6ce40708d95fd9baa20c60c03b40756b9e94","1a0f8261d8384bfefbf2d561d446c3a687a5febe","3de7e6c1504e75d49b0ddeee602e9981873a7f8c","f94350a59508ce0175e33b3427ff0dd92ccc9abf"],"id":"15ebd3a7e559a1319657d288683d0538764c6ed3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/15ebd3a7e559a1319657d288683d0538764c6ed3","authors":[{"name":"Xianzhi Wang","ids":["2877263"]},{"name":"Quan Z.

Due to this popularity it is critical to help the identification of best answers to existing questions for simplifying the access to relevant information. Although it is possible to identify relatively accurately best answers by using binary classifiers coupled with user, content and thread features, existing works have generally ignored to incorporate the thread-like structure of Q&A communities in the design of best answer identification predictors. This paper investigates this particular issue by studying structural normalisation techniques for improving the accuracy of feature based best answer identification models. Thread-based normalisationmethods are introduced for improving the accuracy of identification models by introducing a systematic normalisation approach that normalise predictors by taking into account relations between features and the thread-like structure of Q&A communities.

Access to this data is crucial for government transparency and accountability to the population. The main aim of our research is developing a ranking method for political documents which captures the interesting content within political documents. Text interestingness is a measure of assessing the quality of documents from users' perspective which shows their willingness to read a document. Different approaches are proposed for measuring the interestingness of texts. In this research we focus on measuring political texts' interestingness. As political data sources, we use publicly available parliamentary proceedings.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Measuring Interestingness of Political Documents","journalPages":"1175","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911485"],"entities":["Flickr","Pervasive informatics","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7bedd7d91ec8cb7ad68075e1d973cbdbb79b0597","b519fdc89ea46052c2d626207d7d1832ba79b0b4","32123dd8bd59bca67714bccfac3b6ed6b9680588","351bc4fb0a85f3de3690e0131ad7479c1942ec87","d62e11218d7ce6011f424ef6a453226271a2ff4d","ce10f40bc72e1218a7a83d5b313c669f799bb46f"],"id":"07a5d628f7bdddd11409ddee7b434251bf77357c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/07a5d628f7bdddd11409ddee7b434251bf77357c","authors":[{"name":"Hosein Azarbonyad","ids":["3126891"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2911485"}

This process, known as nugget annotation, is labor-intensive. In this paper, we present two active learning techniques that prioritize the sequence in which candidate nugget/sentence pairs are presented to an assessor, based on the likelihood that the sentence contains a nugget. Our approach builds on the recognition that nugget annotation is similar to high-recall retrieval, and we adapt proven existing solutions. Simulation experiments with four existing TREC test collections show that our techniques yield far more matches for a given level of effort than baselines that are typically deployed in previous nugget-based evaluations.","inCitations":["8cbd4c1087c1a3582df8191d87081dd060fd1283","4717f0a1157b1e1c09590b5484f51f6bf4f9c77b","4fc0ffa82b32c948ef4230b698248273f697d5a2","1b0a3fca046dc667f425e0375cc3e5ded76bee49","3bbfbee3edd9f98847aa751777d95a95a3f32b99","54328292e93ee6b9824e59bcd422960ee1a75344"],"pmid":"","title":"Optimizing Nugget Annotations with Active Learning","journalPages":"2359-2364","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983694","https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~gbaruah/publications/cikm-2016-poster.pdf","https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~h435zhan/CIKM2016.pdf","https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~gbaruah/publications/baruah-et-al-cikm-2016.pdf"],"entities":["Experiment","Optimizing compiler","Question answering","Simulation","Text Retrieval Conference"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["17963c800077aedd3802b3e97d45c286ba953ba4","512b8e363ca5e3e021fc2dd1d4f8564583d557a3","a3e26a5135c3f1ef22b90e9f892729c81eeb8aad","ebff563ee82d78b46a79182ed62f2dd364fd6636","3148be0d8687c3567bf00084a81d06d5d5d45a91","5e351e47cc08f1944d8b8872b3c3a05fe1958f5c","5d72e86b2a1657434c158e556da165e8e0b57f10","e49d662652885e9b71622713838c840cca9d33ed","f6455b04df18a75fac365fa04300c80b1252c84c","63f3b9f6648285159053c3bd917463a91f40a763","33f5ff21cf30836b640847f2077a5c6196081ad2","4e46ca0cd5284d35ca5e6db24839214436905dbb","84b5c148833a830beb9a1e6d0db79314964d75cd","59c9da928fbf10da0c46eef255f14aba2a8ed9a9","de2be8db3cb350be04104645f1b399be17d38f24","88fbf478fd5d0baa2c1d5cc6d0b7daea38893a89","9572408b543cd80dfe31d21459065931c041dab1"],"id":"43520ba60eb643f21494dac152002b650d808f09","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/43520ba60eb643f21494dac152002b650d808f09","authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Baruah","ids":["2027733"]},{"name":"Haotian Zhang","ids":["9184695"]},{"name":"Rakesh Guttikonda","ids":["2025665"]},{"name":"Jimmy J.

The sparsity and noise of short texts often restrict the performance of traditional topic models like LDA. Recently proposed Biterm Topic Model (BTM) which models word co-occurrence patterns directly, is revealed effective for topic detection in short texts. However, BTM has two main drawbacks. It needs to manually specify topic number, which is difficult to accurately determine when facing new corpora. Besides, BTM assumes that two words in same term should belong to the same topic, which is often too strong as it does not differentiate two types of words (i.e. general words and topical words). To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a non-parametric topic model npCTM with the above distinction. Our model incorporates the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) into the BTM model to determine topic number automatically. Our model also distinguishes general words from topical words by jointly considering the distribution of these two word types for each word as well as word coherence information as prior knowledge. We carry out experimental studies on real-world twitter dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to discover coherent topics compared with the baseline methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Non-Parametric Topic Model for Short Texts Incorporating Word Coherence Knowledge","journalPages":"2017-2020","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983898"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Coherence (physics)","Instant messaging","Local-density approximation","Social media","Sparse matrix","Text corpus","Text mining","Topic model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1e63600b5906a6e18c2b9540155b9adb85c4d437","2cf379819632deb93b2cd9250da25bf21fa25171","4987baca7365133a03b8a0849bae337d8bf0c3c4","0d9f1c3c94e975a67b3c70156f4fdb0fe48d0481","36c9632d9f8c80d78975c8442f8e308b65deb824","ce2a5f2633d21ca734dc7f66f0dde223a6f1235e","b5d036429877568a648389531e323ea0983a5148","e7a041dca59381c99ffaaa28ab1143b7877bd42f","3531e0eb9ec8a6ac786146c71ead7f8d624fd2ca","1ba7a3660b02c51ff836cdca507ed92a419b75cb","a642e62c0bd5b5e9396a8f46d4f79cd639dce280","555fe855d0f7dc6c0aebe88ffcf5cda3a2bada69","29f3a031cfdcb44f3b19b8458adffd28ff1b2a9a","1c347f18b5bbbd30baf49e28d523da2d3af9b7cd","efe79376f3c94dcb73d4208f0bd52a3ee004ac1b","3878c832571f81a1f8b171851be303a2e2989832","df827f04a40f4396971ecc7028ae2750904cfced","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1"],"id":"6f2c6993f1dc8e7f0b5ba9353d1013d09b568c44","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6f2c6993f1dc8e7f0b5ba9353d1013d09b568c44","authors":[{"name":"Yuhao Zhang","ids":["49889487"]},{"name":"Wenji Mao","ids":["2419472"]},{"name":"Daniel Dajun Zeng","ids":["1741722"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983898"}

Wikipedia, as crowd-sourced data, faces various data quality issues which significantly impacts knowledge systems depending on it as the information source. One such issue occurs when an anchor text in a Wikipage links to a wrong Wikipage, causing the error link problem. While much of previous work has focused on leveraging Wikipedia for entity linking, little has been done to detect error links.\n In this paper, we address the error link problem, and propose algorithms to detect and correct error links. We introduce an efficient method to generate candidate error links based on iterative ranking in an Anchor Text Semantic Network. This greatly reduces the problem space. A more accurate pairwise learning model was used to detect error links from the reduced candidate error link set, while suggesting correct links in the same time. This approach is effective when data sparsity is a challenging issue. The experiments on both English and Chinese Wikipedia illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also provide a preliminary analysis on possible causes of error links in English and Chinese Wikipedia.","inCitations":["f4605942201e7c8859ae32a16d4ea863bc1463de","44c928e48fdfa5b303177a0a372ad65c2dc04d55","32263194f5a58bbe6fdf7710dce723bf6460fdaa","b3fd26eb2931ff814634d314855b2c2cc007b778","eab0b62001694e685dc1c7419dee0812d3f664df"],"pmid":"","title":"Error Link Detection and Correction in Wikipedia","journalPages":"307-316","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://chywang.github.io/slides/cikm2016s.pdf","https://chywang.github.io/papers/cikm2016.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983705"],"entities":["Algorithm","Anchor text","Crowdsourcing","Data quality","Entity linking","Experiment","Hyperlink","Information source","Iterative method","Knowledge-based systems","Problem domain","Semantic network","Sparse matrix","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5f1ff8b631a67d7bf6e19d89535708ef1cc2bfe2","8fd4f61732b68228ce37863efcf70f5f62a4376f","1f906f304c54d401f9e3f83f678da2733285764b","f3f08c959a54ddc6677256a7b9e2c9a9fd49b720","00a3f6924f90fcd77e6e7e6534b957a75d0ced07","81f8706abcecfc748f2e27d6f7a92628036d6846","e2211f115e3b3b46b81bc2c315052caa01d0f00f","110f729addefa9de072e80cbcf68e034ed3c0116","1ccf386465081b6f8cad5a753827de7576dfe436","fd74236c6bbee63004f9893312160299d5190769","5340800e5d28e03273bf9f5dbefa91fb33c5b2f5","8c1e9dac0a2e74a5b7d8ff2a680e4d2cd1590531","166fee9452934aa612c56d6162e5e2ba427bdfb3","9ac34c7040d08a27e7dc75cfa46eb0144de3a284","0484edee55ee8c456e13b15b9f25f97f40351691","4fa0d9c4c3d17458085ee255b7a4b7c325d59e32","915970e9deffa032b6c7519a38ac6d6dbb115eb3","05252b795f0f1238ac7e0d7af7fc2372c34a181d","0f12659990a8795269a02e733090651ff801b84e","93cbd1f313dad71b355a9743fba64182e63c3b81","e7e3c117c566201da387949d4ae98d7d9308d57a","7cefb030aae7ea1e45c0f7d5308c33d0c971ebe4","9a07401c1b81e3c5c529673cef6421cc6689e532","07abd02f02774d178f26ca99937e5f94001a9ec9","26d069c00c21cc00a07a3a7ef220b5eedf76c38b","330e34265ccfe789810695cf38e40c97b873d920","52019c64adf89cfe2568b0f1722638374e1d59bc","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","30a5a31ef4c213e22850afe6ab0069d0428972d6","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","821d09b60b52af20fa938634607f1f7d65df8743"],"id":"ad010b90cc9b62dbe44a59b4c146f63921302f5e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ad010b90cc9b62dbe44a59b4c146f63921302f5e","authors":[{"name":"Chengyu Wang","ids":["50097294"]},{"name":"Rong Zhang","ids":["48263932"]},{"name":"Xiaofeng He","ids":["7792408"]},{"name":"Aoying Zhou","ids":["1696626"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983705"}

These efforts will be framed by a case study in which, ironically, our own research became the target of a coordinated disinformation campaign [5].","inCitations":["c008dbb7f939e1904955f8f9dfaeaea01b5292f4","48a87709aad306d67748ab863cb61dce399907a8","56f55c920cc3a0cf0d999c1d4114e2598df1e3db"],"pmid":"","title":"The Spread of Misinformation in Social Media","journalPages":"717","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/914d/39f9b73cb4c71121fdfa527e0d309e89454d.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2890092","http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p717.pdf","http://helper.ipam.ucla.edu/publications/caws3/caws3_13275.pdf"],"entities":["Computation","Data mining","Machine learning","Network science","Online and offline","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["897dacb034ad17ad44af8e31af56fd2a3a08ec30","09c206e26c379b5ba852557363cd6415acb38368","1fc5873bdb5532f4cf64ced4d6632757b00ed318","7e8a5e0a87fab337d71ce04ba02b7a5ded392421","beca05e54359339fe4eb03d231689aa6884534a8","34ead52ee8def3f07ad5ee1fea6b5e06fed3385c","1f779bb04bf3510cc8b0fc8f5dba896f5e4e6b95","2d59aad86b841c6d1404b28c8d6ebefa53222784","0c46b067779d7132c5fd097baadc261348afb261"],"id":"914d39f9b73cb4c71121fdfa527e0d309e89454d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/914d39f9b73cb4c71121fdfa527e0d309e89454d","authors":[{"name":"Filippo Menczer","ids":["1727649"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2890092"}

Event discovery is one of such tasks, which is to identify interesting happenings in the geographical and temporal space. In recent years, several techniques have been proposed. However, no existing work has provided a nonparametric algorithm for detecting events in the joint space crossing geographical and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, though some prior works proposed to capture the periodicities of topics in their solutions, some restrictions on the temporal patterns are often placed and they usually ignore the spatial patterns of the topics. To break through such limitations, in this paper we propose a novel nonparametric model to identify events in the geographical and temporal space, where any recurrent patterns of events can be automatically captured. In our approach, parameters are automatically determined by exploiting a Dirichlet Process. To reduce the influence from noisy terms in the detection, we distinguish its event role from its background role using a Bernoulli model in the solution. Experimental results on three real world datasets show the proposed algorithm outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.","inCitations":["c2a877dae041ddc2b63d97a6e9a2acfd192b987e","052865351bdcc2d6f73f058d0cd53d597a20ae3d","5a7db051fe457aa23f344174da5082693a419652"],"pmid":"","title":"A Nonparametric Model for Event Discovery in the Geospatial-Temporal Space","journalPages":"499-508","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983790"],"entities":["Algorithm","Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam theory","Sensor"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a59af8e31918f78eae03d20e7f6481d074fc087","0ae76a541ff54e7e1007e14284e8e3f9c9a99935","422a5cce1b7d6c46628d27d27aa4bc0fd6f219c4","08a591b1b30a2f3b1c94d33387e9cd515e95c186","7f8abf25ca24b48450b4e535f41e2b8a87df73f5","3e5755b6d4e1b21f2a90544c43c2f57d953cdfc3","21a0f88ba4c4481bb31f683376bbdc6c87986b02","742439a54ed5a133c422f80c77fac88671b11dec","215aa495b4c860a1e6d87f2c36f34da464376cc4","b1ff1c931b5cf8647fc60e39fd182764495a1bb6","cb213c8cfffed734ca8d8c5695363a44981cb5b1","2ab86a3a69bf3eb60856a5443c9702c9398986d5","01a7995cf0b1c89ec6322cc2b734f70e6b18e222","0771cba7f23ccb12fce82edf582017ec9280def7","82db03db1f9f90c46b393c07e4b0e0efb3d9a16f","aed38235ba619304a8c4fb8ee56633901247be46","087ab67119b7caf129e93d8daa170a7c12a2a8f6","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","9e0df10b4d25dfd16e1e2b29535973861ff61201","71ee948548e7badc6be1f26e92340c7f4828bfb6","2b8a80b18cc7a4461c6e532c2f3de7e570d4fcd6","76c2f936e57f94bacf5a532745032fefa6bc59ee","0681699cbc30fe3badf89cdbad89abe83cdb885b","3ae127e81ed62c38f4b459a26dec6bdc31bc62cf","354217a75a9c9ec9bcdbf945e999b44f383b8897","06584de7f82107ee61504fc7e5156c258c33f18f","e1551d5e24d7d7986ee63c0858502b4b082cdeec"],"id":"0ef189a41e1404a4f5eeddfee02c6ce27452ced3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0ef189a41e1404a4f5eeddfee02c6ce27452ced3","authors":[{"name":"Jinjin Guo","ids":["50115760"]},{"name":"Zhiguo Gong","ids":["1735422"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983790"}

The research of my PhD thesis focuses on image emotion computing (IEC), which aims to predict the emotion perceptions of given images. The development of IEC is greatly constrained by two main challenges: affective gap and subjective evaluation [5]. Previous works mainly focused on finding features that can express emotions better to bridge the affective gap, such as elements-of-art based features [2] and shape features [1]. Based on the emotion representation models, including categorical emotion states (CES) and dimensional emotion space (DES) [5], three different tasks are traditionally performed on IEC: affective image classification, regression and retrieval. The state-of-the-art methods on the three above tasks are image-centric, focusing on the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. For my PhD thesis, I plan to answer the following questions: 1. Compared to the low-level elements-of-art based features, can we find some higher level features that are more interpretable and have stronger link to emotions? 2. Are the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image subjective and different? If they are, how can we tackle the user-centric emotion prediction? 3. For imagecentric emotion computing, can we predict the emotion distribution instead of the dominant emotion category? 1. The artistic elements must be carefully arranged and orchestrated into meaningful regions and images to describe specific semantics and emotions. The rules, tools or guidelines of arranging and orchestrating the elements-of-art in an artwork are known as the principles-of-art, which consider various artistic aspects, including balance, emphasis, harmony, variety, gradation, movement, rhythm, and proportion [5]. We systematically study and formulize the former 6 artistic principles, explaining the concepts and translating these concepts into mathematical formulae. 2. The images in Abstract dataset [2] were labeled by 14 people on average. 81% images are assigned with 5 to 8 emotions. So the perceived emotions of different viewers may vary. To further demonstrate this observation, we set up a large-scale dataset, named Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset, with over 1 million images downloaded from Flickr. To get the personalized emotion labels, firstly we use traditional lexicon-based methods as in [4] to obtain the text segmentation results of the title, tags and descrip-","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Affective Computing of Image Emotion Perceptions","journalPages":"703","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://ai2-s2-pdf-tmp.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdf83.pdf","https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e0ab/3b212c3846893d4f0e488756f39601098b94.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2835776.2855082"],"entities":["Affective computing","Computer vision","Flickr","High- and low-level","Lexicon","Personalization","Text segmentation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2c411a12f33f15451e1659a3435391962c0cc144","9e1024c983839c423a45df8854259cd92204ae96","f5d225df61fa659ce2539a5709194de747dfcf36","10744949b8ee1a2e878fe5fb17eda00d9dbc9b5d","094bf2413bbfca19992aa9950ffeb3a0a7497a82","74bd844878a4e3b96660d1e236e25cd473a0bfee","2c5c9a6cd63424fba87744b0ab10f9076bd21586","26a6ee00528724c7b61e22cfe90b994523b88d00"],"id":"e0ab3b212c3846893d4f0e488756f39601098b94","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e0ab3b212c3846893d4f0e488756f39601098b94","authors":[{"name":"Sicheng Zhao","ids":["1755487"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2835776.2855082"}

Like other topic models, NOC represents each document as a mixture of topics and generates each word from one topic. Unlike these models, NOC focuses on both a topic structure as an internal linguistic structure, and N gram as an external linguistic structure. To improve the quality of topic specific N -grams, NOC reveals a tree of topics that captures the semantic relationship between topics from a given corpus as context, and forms N -gram by offering power-law distributions for word frequencies on this topic tree. To gain both these linguistic structures efficiently, NOC learns them from a given corpus in a unified manner. By accessing this entire tree at the word level in the generative process of each document, NOC enables each document to maintain a thematic coherence and form N -grams over context. We develop a parallelizable inference algorithm, DNOC, to support large data sets. Experiments on review articles/papers/tweet show that NOC is useful as a generative model to discover both the topic structure and the corresponding N -grams, and well complements human experts and domain specific knowledge. D-NOC can process large data sets while preserving full generative model performance, by the help of an open-source distributed machine learning framework.","inCitations":["edbd19c430d2d4512818b65d3aa3f39929bc5fb6","69669af61ba7152a6fadfe360d767649275626f5"],"pmid":"","title":"N-gram over Context","journalPages":"1045-1055","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ec6b/608742a217c59daee56084b7134e5e2fa54a.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2882981","http://datamining.dongguk.ac.kr/lectures/2016-2/bigdata/p1045.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cache coherence","Generative model","Machine learning","N-gram","Network on a chip","Open-source software","Outline (list)","Scalability","Stream (computing)","Streaming media","Text corpus","Text mining","Topic model","Word lists by frequency"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0ef311acf523d4d0e2cc5f747a6508af2c89c5f7","56702c8ddc72ba45eaad4e5b6d44afe86b8a4a9d","0874f9274a471819b5ed82a07e67003a91913b65","34b8809c214db18544ce93674bf85fce0e8b3330","18bbdf8dfd13c227d68f9630c89c6cc66be66c0f","7df073fd756756e4f639b2894325cb32164cf7de","55ef10672b69aaa4db60faeb3776d85f7af1a5f9","17dd45edfcf5769cd4c62e3a930d29216a8ca8a6","07713a3daa1a0d8431b8997f677634f7e84b05a8","d32bcfcbda913facb52c919f95e504f41f089526","01a7995cf0b1c89ec6322cc2b734f70e6b18e222","b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d","0602a179593a238a5cc4ef6f8d6df5d37296e391","22da4cbfa4e29da9a43996324c318dd33b947b48","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","a0df4c1d00700023bce86426ae1e21b9e5d12d6d","0ecc5ffeae38689dd2fe6ed4c32a6745744d7641","0a5feab178ddb179a37f3a19b69b4a956ed797d8","c63832c089c59d1370192f1ea187c18318359922","c6ef3955c8c4bf826b2c33e5c1bccc84720c8f3b","16f2deb863ef6d3d6f432de12a2e81149ab03e5a","6abc111ca444b449505bbf4e649b49a40eaf6e9b","354217a75a9c9ec9bcdbf945e999b44f383b8897","62f991612959e6fff29128b1d1a54596f6504029","15012c597bf9a28272090028cb81e25e9514b210"],"id":"ec6b608742a217c59daee56084b7134e5e2fa54a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ec6b608742a217c59daee56084b7134e5e2fa54a","authors":[{"name":"Noriaki Kawamae","ids":["2726032"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872427.2882981"}

While such functions return high-quality results, they create efficiency challenges as it is too costly to fully evaluate them on all documents in the union, or even intersection, of the query terms. To address this issue, search engines use a series of cascading rankers, starting with a very simple ranking function and then applying increasingly complex and expensive ranking functions on smaller and smaller sets of candidate results. Researchers have recently started studying several problems within this framework of query processing by cascading rankers; see, e.g., [5, 13, 17, 51].\n We focus on one such problem, the design of the initial cascade. Thus, the goal is to very quickly identify a set of good candidate documents that should be passed to the second and further cascades. Previous work by Asadi and Lin [3, 5] showed that while a top-k computation on either the union or intersection gives good results, a further optimization using a global document ordering based on spam scores leads to a significant reduction in quality. Our contribution is to propose an alternative framework that builds specialized single-term and pairwise index structures, and then during query time selectively accesses these structures based on a cost budget and a set of early termination techniques. Using an end-to-end evaluation with a complex machine-learned ranker, we show that our approach finds candidates about an order of magnitude faster than a conjunctive top-k computation, while essentially matching the quality.","inCitations":["8e7958a75fac8e045864e8192ff383ee909f2837","081d6cf68ab29a71286d8bd8fd774546b1073ef8","484d106f0c5d6b1bf64a6667a1b319d01145a062"],"pmid":"","title":"Fast First-Phase Candidate Generation for Cascading Rankers","journalPages":"295-304","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://engineering.nyu.edu/~suel/papers/candi.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911515"],"entities":["Computation","Database","End-to-end principle","Fractional cascading","Local Interconnect Network","Mathematical optimization","Ranking (information retrieval)","Spamming","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7dc6900d49606be373ca12c71d625479235417ef","769258c69974e5a26f793ca626b9d8e6b80ed44c","8cdab6370f1d4246161966d36684084163eca2d8","0436536e6a961f278eced064058d0b4d68b9fc5e","aec38cdf52cb3d764d1b2b9b5662ef9097f0a96f","119c30b6aa6a09bf0b3883ff8cf03b3fd3958c8d","48fe4acbe59e450e3a86cf709c217493b743a87a","d773473d27f7342ebf39d3f513988ea2ae74ec4d","b98ac75db79a04cde3c15341ef7f54ea4c45f270","a401596b7c337afefe0ea228ef9cd4908429b43a","57864d755a78d27fd241abd670d6c71517dd27f5","c458b2718b1cbcb94794432632df8aa03becda3d","63041be8f2b81ecc2df2564f1794f48832cad6aa","d458c0627a4f5c80852eb0b68fb9faae7fd0f750","9c9c4a03290263be09fcbe54d2188966a165ffca","91a353974741cdcac274f8dfeabde87430fbc05b","b648925030b450502ca5fa956561c243a7d01ba9","280cdf3adec8a539c1fabd3e1368f2e74964924c","6f6466ed023d39144c343549ee6e9400f404306d","6369b86c50b542c65e63754508720cb219fda495","6f96c0890e3caf0a4a5d63215a2ef820aebe641c","33e48b2437d51a766b0dd986b78804157c1cfdc4","2d48453fedbe98ac0dec7094cfeab554f4010357","409f067439ecbc2da37a03c9609034946393608e","472dd74882ff85d89fc70b54e88fc9f40d3c1380","0707acb09adcd2f6946cbd09264414c83918f392","dc75b2811d2cd01b30fa850351aae2e0fa092cfe","34e347b2f7f055c192054a606a71b315d156bef2","23ae867fdc9c88741f973c205a57ccf7a1d30901","7f7d58dd3163389470e67a1ffd4da45bb6f3f398","38efc2e0b283be836d940ddfeed3ab351d3af5dd","8f308a14b34bcccc9be48169bc5d20adab265236","9b456541fe3c6b5e966ad4be4cf93cae988fecdc","14eaeb5314223723d01717848b575e23239f5168","89d27fc4c5bf15762d001a39f0a74f84c89d3681","639c5d11e675b0287342399e2094dbe47f9e4b44","29136ccbf99cf6132223b1031e559d9b90a0ecf5","502a1ca67a644652706e487e7b8dd72614026dd1","924276d95d1bdaf087beb0ccf699443b9bf855ec","01d77dc739a53c7a09902a623ee7a9b86ae1fc94","06c9d6433d81591fd533e4055004717f68233c62","1cab5c4fdebd338f7ad0986fdf2b284ea7560e16","ae076cf7d202709ee8d4b004a5798a337cdf75bd","beb19b3919c4ebabc147c9a306956b19208cfaf5","6f6b883bf34da6e8a729887a4ce504a2e6c1f711","31eae38c4c922f2f47e1b6e5c53f4ccda542e75e","920593a3ed1c95b7339da04eb97fc857a4f58c9c","18e93fa7d408e9596992f3d63155cb92827839a4","737208889226ad62c587eb660ffceda6344faf69","40707bd624bc789d26f13734de41fa41c866a332","0d002ab7a9509960e77039432038fe6320e465e5","80ac6390e471b7159726bea0f0f8645f0eb6e478","9336c4feb0b86f7dc8fef1faa08d8a4bcf25eb81","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","03471d79bc549d3eab27af1a77166c505ec4f25a","7c128d2dcf64d18cbbc3abb395a0583ba3e1fbdb","bef32204602dcac233751688fc45c7cecb4439b6","9ac34c7040d08a27e7dc75cfa46eb0144de3a284"],"id":"441c5281ff24502e84e237560c1550c9b65a9146","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/441c5281ff24502e84e237560c1550c9b65a9146","authors":[{"name":"Qi Wang","ids":["47599117"]},{"name":"Constantinos Dimopoulos","ids":["49957031"]},{"name":"Torsten Suel","ids":["1691664"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2911515"}

Twitter data contains rich content and structured information on users\u2019 topics of interest and behavior patterns. Correctly analyzing and modeling Twitter data enables the prediction of the user behavior and preference in a variety of practical applications, such as tweet recommendation and followee recommendation. Although a number of models have been developed on Twitter data in prior work, most of these only model the tweets from users, while neglecting their valuable retweet information in the data. Models would enhance their predictive power by incorporating users\u2019 retweet content as well as their retweet behavior. In this paper, we propose two novel Bayesian nonparametric models, URM and UCM, on retweet data. Both of them are able to integrate the analysis of tweet text and users\u2019 retweet behavior in the same probabilistic framework. Moreover, they both jointly model users\u2019 interest in tweet and retweet. As nonparametric models, URM and UCM can automatically determine the parameters of the models based on input data, avoiding arbitrary parameter settings. Extensive experiments on real-world Twitter data show that both URM and UCM are superior to all the baselines, while UCM further outperforms URM, confirming the appropriateness of our models in retweet modeling.","inCitations":["a9d4faeb89071600136610667f78c48c36161f77","36426bb91a3550656a6de723487efea6289e8556","c1fab2b199aa4af49960127d5e40f79dd1bce409","44b43b52ae5ee54d0b441579c9b57ddd09af8025","589f7899ebb2b8d1534876decfd7aba74793744a","687741b85d3c7eda0f93db019735ead62cb5660b","c47bdca879a59e341ed7659dfa423112f0d7ce27","ea5a980087279f5950429ca1db78cfcd89ad9653"],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling a Retweet Network via an Adaptive Bayesian Approach","journalPages":"459-469","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fb06/56490df7d58173f71f04094bf73ab9ae2be8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2882985","http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/~cho/papers/p459-bi.pdf"],"entities":["Experiment","Norm (social)","Rational ClearCase UCM"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2cf379819632deb93b2cd9250da25bf21fa25171","0f6e59032e88bcba4e78abd97d55ac27336b0036","0c7247c74f946590eca6221d5b9d906d0f4d22c3","0544708f94c3a6ce1126dfff0192133e0d23ef5d","c6ef3955c8c4bf826b2c33e5c1bccc84720c8f3b","21c7324bb0ed64a2d045a5036a181427919fdecb","0fa69f27691baf2d635c3b3c579325fcd32b6daf","32cbd065ac9405530ce0b1832a9a58c7444ba305","ea0e4dcaa3638a00b347504ff66f91b3e5358e93","5afc96145b117108dbfcdbb73d379adf040200e8","70b992c5d563b6fd198997dae32c2bc7cc78fb80","263f103fd2bfbbd6aeb392c6519d3f590e647c0a","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","a772b2d623e90159021d093333c55dbeeac7bd2c","7064bd5a311b3d29c236d64047af9c2e0abe94c9","f84ce7af2272428232d76d6352a50599ba07576f","14715b8f7b474eef4e30041b8ac197c2995ee6ac","01a7995cf0b1c89ec6322cc2b734f70e6b18e222","b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d","82783e26dcc371ddf311084b095382f7058ddba9","055960432e6931c78627984b80b1e33b325383eb","856e1c92a39b3b895c2663ad417f2a2f372d8a9d","3531e0eb9ec8a6ac786146c71ead7f8d624fd2ca","226569e5064221563774fb78422cc10ba2b4611d","771dc593e9760ae8decf2a197ddbc2f4cb6f5cfd","6bbc1a732e87fec1a5df807020b34c453f841641","80f632dae7169eafcc4bc6435434f28d73bf1177","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","71bb73561ef7e13f9523567b7db39a3036e63c63","29f3a031cfdcb44f3b19b8458adffd28ff1b2a9a","2fad3b1dda9fa6afe9a5ec9bb29c3645e9d90f6d","68c00878f943771d1d44d233deead8c019972dae"],"id":"fb0656490df7d58173f71f04094bf73ab9ae2be8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fb0656490df7d58173f71f04094bf73ab9ae2be8","authors":[{"name":"Bin Bi","ids":["2555622"]},{"name":"Junghoo Cho","ids":["4658767"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872427.2882985"}

However, it is a challenge for people to manually digest all the opinions buried in large amounts of review data, raising the need for automatic opinion summarization and analysis. One fundamental challenge in automatic opinion summarization and analysis is to mine implicit features, i.e., recognizing the features implicitly mentioned (referred to) in a review sentence. Existing approaches require many ad hoc manual parameter tuning, and are thus hard to optimize or generalize; their evaluation has only been done with Chinese review data. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on generative feature language models that can mine the implicit features more effectively through unsupervised statistical learning. The parameters are optimized automatically using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We also created eight new data sets to facilitate evaluation of this task in English. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is very effective for assigning features to sentences that do not explicitly mention the features, and outperforms the existing algorithms by a large margin.","inCitations":["4e5592a19eab030938b228e934b3dc162f5cc6d9"],"pmid":"","title":"Generative Feature Language Models for Mining Implicit Features from Customer Reviews","journalPages":"929-938","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983729"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Cryptographic hash function","Expectation\u2013maximization algorithm","Heuristic","Hoc (programming language)","Language model","Machine learning","MinEd","Natural language","Supervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["29366f39dc4237a380f20e9ae9fbeffa645200c9","8e07435b87708199ddace381b4147a69c8e7c4cb","303b0b6e6812c60944a4ac9914222ac28b0813a2","4ed949b75b1d8e4daba7d74ed8b7965c41830349","15eb21447102dface000b47a75f1ff489a136921","0e8d3f68c0a0eb9dab241c63aab319dbf596e697","3055134761ca2e7748d7d5325d70231d3391d847","13e5f0c40c85ca8e01b3756963d5352358de7c29","40bf5c774fd7da2a312cfac9dd8521cf89e11d52","5040c699cc3a02d8dd2eecfdb20e5690432ad7a5","7132667598c7f51304cebaf987d7e30a32f06bf9","ff7546f49b05261e13c4fe6ff8621b8e37f857ce","36cb4ed29f9f0b6ea37343b3d98154293a374ec2","26e8f3cc46b710a013358bf0289df4de033446ba","87fe8163dcaff9b5cb759439c47c2c4661c78829","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","6aedc02edbd48c06a70b3e7bfef8888ded61c83d","105a0b3826710356e218685f87b20fe39c64c706","745782902e97be8fbacd1e05d283f11104e2fec6","308b39ea5aaf6f9a9d182142786c1b21d991dfd4"],"id":"3327681aac883db51ee51c3df761c8e2a1354d77","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3327681aac883db51ee51c3df761c8e2a1354d77","authors":[{"name":"Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu","ids":["2692077"]},{"name":"Parikshit Sondhi","ids":["3267191"]},{"name":"ChengXiang Zhai","ids":["1736467"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983729"}

Along with the prosperity of Web 2.0, we are now able to collect extremely massive conversational data, which are publicly available. It casts a great opportunity to launch automatic conversation systems. Owing to the diversity of Web resources, a retrieval-based conversation system will be able to find at least some responses from the massive repository for any user inputs. Given a human issued message, i.e., query, our system would provide a reply after adequate training and learning of how to respond. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-based conversation system with the deep learning-to-respond schema through a deep neural network framework driven by web data. The proposed model is general and unified for different conversation scenarios in open domain. We incorporate the impact of multiple data inputs, and formulate various features and factors with optimization into the deep learning framework. In the experiments, we investigate the effectiveness of the proposed deep neural network structures with better combinations of all different evidence. We demonstrate significant performance improvement against a series of standard and state-of-art baselines in terms of p@1, MAP, nDCG, and MRR for conversational purposes.","inCitations":["c91b4b3a20a7637ecbb7e0179ac3108f3cf11880","7fdf8d0e4424a01d81707b9de9a18fda01013949","99c4a55ddd5ab202459383a18e0899d9673926cf","3a835cc957139f9caf0b9ec93b0d1889f4ac2857","0e3412e22fb75ea54354f54a3e0140092d0dfdf9","fce2aca597ed854d2b86d4cac545614576006045","0540d0ddbe4316dc256e9f0c26dd1854e6dae185","4ea92f2ddbb7ce610c6e80377e61397bad7309ff","4336ebe1ff72933ad5db4ac8855fada1b2c85e3a","9716416a15e79a36e3481bcdad79cdc905603e6d","c49281ca9240e9dfd458b196be57cf4bf3636771","f27be01ce79e086c02547137524db0a428239ff7","9ad7ce84537ab78bfdb2e6a91fe37ca78bea4cb9","330c5eaca3bcc4a431cbd57c610f2096055782a1","3fa6ccf2e0cf89fe758b9d634030102f9c3f928a","f5d5bcd58d6bb290918f4d8ff7270981c00404a2","87be87367ec23caa83a4dc1b6282802ab873f5af","aad56aebfdc8cc58a948b50958261b4804fd3bc9","0768dc097d64491c9e6819f01fb810b06dc21185","06e7ba45e4def91c280360791031f2b24d9898e5","809c8c7a5aac470da228dddbe46d239f2748fb24","57448237399d3e71a6d0df08901f0b9004183abc","a6eec00f10346ce27d4f69f9e38f5665fffe8056","96c407155bc8b9f24fd112e55fa3ed1a01030c31","297e1b9c24fc6f5d481c52cdc2f305d45ecfddb2","3e37b7d4b60334ba083f60d69a73a8c251458d03","3d763e753e313fe325380dee2119f7a340819349","b6a186f9b801cd10cc10e556ef30b49cbba2fbd0","1a5cc4e66d50a21289799373876334385456b9fa","2b954fc7804ff96da6cd8d94012b5f94d4a25e25","c15679f1e190f559cb6123bfa058b5b8adc8c81e","1a2684280c447851be1456881f3621d07fda769e","febf7c3b532ceb029fe17a0e1c43ec84c308a781","64c4ce6f8e0c6cfea0609b9f2d86962cc7c97d90","11da0c54ba904a1cb31a09d10da55f73e8825c61","98c8b2dc13d3d93e0306694a8aa5a2637ca72dea","60e6d991462d3995cdb6079e5e49ee40e5a583b4","d855ff93b31f9aa1b93246df2c9807b43261ddfb","07577af75ca95e7666888d19969a53ef4dd905a5","0af8eea643b0391fb552db4828d7706366ee546f","5f7690abab9304949b62ee7ee44f0a1a52be90e7","eb74d7539d25e415a12e1159a7d0300e505f2b73","f6335a158a3f4fcfffe74f2df1d55d835bf95095","a8555994c3a639187d03712e89d609d9a06af7af","8d41b72dc663a44733ac96148a3e5b03a7da48c4","2cac08d4eddc03d8d38656e1e57a430afb37670b","849bb402af1dd335e32a1bd253d1f5803942e9fe","8a9ffa66aeae0f7596cce9db8f42919d863cff26","b6cd2d28398a1efb7472039ba077625c2d5a7686","b64994467a2e962d9852ae9b914e289c87507181","1a7189cd1418e64be99f33ff08acaaa69fea712f","a3f5fa5d82110acbb8d5a0f8453565b5dd4e59c7","2c960b44cb415ff9455ab8eccdcc3cadfb8b74b6","7d76dfecf6aeeb7717aaa0d7664fc59e6613aef2","8ecaff11e660cc225f390b1a07fe5c1918c9d4af","76f449e391ba7fe2428ca563dbd2a1f0cdb54710","839897b416c0fb889ed6a74e3a7d7c0321a9df05","dcecd65af9fce077bc8de294ad806a6439692d2c","caa8b954566c9a97db0267b281d8a9843ecfac3d","aad41c3828185b8d3e89b73867476b63ad0b9383","50733aebb9fa0397f6fda33f39d4827feb74a0a6","f35da515aa6e2f1e5a1292dbfe6b70bfd96b2818","b94784a91fb089a12ac6981bb5bc8f178ffc5fd1","2e0bed618d023cad81eae218e69afce8bef8e4d6","1d46fc6f0e2ea458061a21acd246127f96b37444","91babfc7d7820c901fe4a7ddb829c2df285e090e","c90a4c6849b55d9503aff30731969ef58a73915c"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning

{"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3053408.3053427","venue":"SIGIR Forum","journalName":"SIGIR Forum","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2016,"paperAbstract":"In recent years we have witnessed an explosion in publishing data on the Web, mostly in the form of Linked Data. An important question is how typical users, who mainly use keyword search queries, can access and exploit this constantly increasing body of knowledge. Although existing interaction paradigms in Semantic Search hide their complexity behind easy-to-use interfaces, they have not managed to cover common search needs. At the same time, according to several studies, a large number of search tasks are of exploratory nature. However, in such tasks the traditional \"ranked list\" approach for interacting with the retrieved results is often inadequate.\n The objective of this thesis is to enable effective exploratory search services which can bridge the gap between the classic responses of non-semantic search systems (e.g., Professional Search Systems, Web Search Engines) and semantic information expressed in the form of Linked Open Data (LOD). Towards this direction, we introduce an approach in which named entities (like names of persons, locations, chemical substances, etc.) are exploited as the glue for automatically connecting documents (search results) with data and knowledge. We study an approach where this entity-based integration is performed at real-time, without any human intervention and without the need of prebuilt indexes. This allows the provision of \"fresh\" information, the easy configuration of this functionality according to the needs of the underlying search application, as well as its easy exploitation by existing search systems.\n The provision of the aforementioned functionality is challenging. At first, the LOD that are available on the Web are big, are distributed in many knowledge bases, are increased and updated continuously, and also cover many domains. Consequently, there is the need of an interoperability model that will allow the specification of the entities of interest as well as of the related and useful semantic data. In addition, the number of extractable entities from the search results can be very high and the same is true for the amount of semantic information that can be retrieved from the LOD for these entities (i.e., the number of their attributes and of their associations with other entities). Thus, there is also the need of methods that can estimate the important (for the search context) entities, attributes and associations.\n To cope with the above challenges, this thesis proposes a semantic analysis process in which the search results are connected with data and knowledge at real-time without any human intervention. For describing the entities of interest, as well as the related (and useful for the application context) semantic information, we propose a generic model for configuring a Named Entity Extraction (NEE) system, while for specifying the semantics of this model, we introduce an RDF/S vocabulary, called \"Open NEE Configuration Model\", which allows a NEE system to describe (and publish as LOD) its entity-mining capabilities. To enable associating the result of a NEE process with an applied configuration, we propose an extension of the Open Annotation Data Model which also allows publishing the annotation results as LOD. To examine the feasibility of this model, we developed the system X-Link which, contrary to existing NEE systems, allows its easy configuration by exploiting one or more semantic Knowledge Bases. To identify the important semantic information related to the search results, we introduce and study a ranking method that is based on the Random Walk model and which exploits the extracted entities and their connectivity. The exploitation of the selected semantic information is achieved either through the visualization of the related semantic graph and/or in the context of a faceted interaction model that allows the user to gradually restrict the search space. Besides, this thesis studied the exploitation of such graphs for re-ranking the list of retrieved results aiming to promote relevant but low-ranked hits.\n The dissertation reports extensive evaluation results of the proposed functionalities and methods. Regarding the system X-Link, a task-based evaluation with users showed its ease of configuration, while a case study illustrated the efficiency of the supported operations. The comparative evaluation of the proposed probabilistic scheme for ranking entities and semantic data showed that the proposed approach is more effective compared to other ranking approaches (producing a more than 20% better ranking). Regarding the presentation of the important entities (and of their associations), the conducted survey in a marine-related search context demonstrated that the majority of participants (more than 70%) prefer to see a graph representation of entities related to the retrieved results regardless of the type of the submitted query. The evaluation of the proposed probabilistic algorithm for re-ranking the retrieved search results (using TREC datasets related to the medical domain) showed that this approach can notably improve the list of results by promoting relevant hits in higher positions. Finally, the implementation and the experimental results of the proposed search process demonstrated its feasibility and efficiency, and also enabled us to reveal its limitations.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Exploiting Linked Data in Exploratory Search","journalPages":"104-105","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/p104.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3053408.3053427"],"entities":["Context (computing)","Data model","Exploratory search","Faceted classification","Graph (abstract data type)","Interaction","Interoperability","Knowledge base","Learning to rank","Linked data","Named entity","Randomized algorithm","Real-time clock","Search algorithm","Semantic analysis (compilers)","Semantic search","System X (computing)","Vocabulary","Web search engine","Web search query","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"50","outCitations":[],"id":"066aee4f7bfc5c4352c109c1722d83b96940764f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/066aee4f7bfc5c4352c109c1722d83b96940764f","authors":[{"name":"Pavlos Fafalios","ids":["2393008"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3053408.3053427"}

These functions require as input statistics about the terms in the queries and documents, where the intention is that the statistics are estimates of the relative informativeness of the terms. Common measures of informativeness use the number of documents containing each term (the document frequency) as a key measure. We argue in this paper that the distribution of within-document frequencies across a collection is also pertinent to informativeness, a measure that has not been considered in prior work: the most informative words tend to be those whose frequency of occurrence has high variance. We propose use of relative standard deviation (RSD) as a measure of variability incorporating within-document frequencies, and show that RSD compares favourably with inverse document frequency (IDF), in both in-principle analysis and in practice in retrieval, with small but consistent gains.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"How Informative is a Term?: Dispersion as a measure of Term Specificity","journalPages":"853-856","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914687"],"entities":["Document","Experiment","Information retrieval","Really Simple Discovery","Relevance","Self-information","Sensitivity and specificity","Spatial variability","Tf\u2013idf"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d87ceda3042f781c341ac17109d1e94a717f5f60","4dcdde9a51341de24ed71c5c9308c26e7582d8b8","e91fc6cba8b23688d02b0dc3ead69ed05210bf33","9377ff055de047c1e348d4e44439dc57782627e3","4f09e6ec1b7d4390d23881852fd7240994abeb58","92af2d0fd422d8ff70fce1c748e6b581d52d2c35","88fbf478fd5d0baa2c1d5cc6d0b7daea38893a89","0eefc8acf6c56006b15e46a42039f666d393193f","8c864586b3d9964aa64576c8001d586614697daf","4008d78a584102086f2641bcb0dab51aff0d353b","36332b20043472051a34fc89a1dccf6a88a5caa4","393d1f3b81410536944dff9514a2b787094e846d"],"id":"6f57b36759d32e5c35e14eae1b19e97ca40f93b2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6f57b36759d32e5c35e14eae1b19e97ca40f93b2","authors":[{"name":"Rodney McDonell","ids":["3430744"]},{"name":"Justin Zobel","ids":["1751206"]},{"name":"Bodo Billerbeck","ids":["1748336"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2914687"}

In this paper, we use Social Network Analysis to compare users' pre-existing social networks with the quantity of their contributions to an online chat-based collaborative activity in a higher education classroom. In addition, we consider whether the amount of diversity present in one's social network leads to more online contributions in an anonymous cross-cultural collaborative setting. Our findings indicate that pre-existing social connections can predict how much users contribute to online education-related collaborative activities with diverse group members, even more so than academic performance. Furthermore, our findings suggest that future Web Science research should consider how the more traditionally 'qualitative' socio-cultural influences affect user participation and use of online collaborative tools.","inCitations":["00842340ed76a9f13e42b7cb4dbb9798e340adae"],"pmid":"","title":"Using social network analysis to predict online contributions: the impact of network diversity in cross-cultural collaboration","journalPages":"269-273","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://oro.open.ac.uk/46221/1/Web%20Science%2016%20revised.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2908131.2908169"],"entities":["Collaborative software","Online chat","Social network analysis","Web application","Web science"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6078199249b6c42436b63c75b46ed2480e788094","69e837d1fb20a038c309425c73b6bf19b22e99f9","2cbce793b415f0db7253c5de0b082922f9fb8d8c","953bfe565b98e2b153cfac983e2b523ff411007c","80528d96bb80530ba42a4d1ee347a98dd6f06a31"],"id":"362018ab1eae6b8773ed0d52749033c3a8bac789","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/362018ab1eae6b8773ed0d52749033c3a8bac789","authors":[{"name":"Jenna Mittelmeier","ids":["3403515"]},{"name":"Yingfei Heliot","ids":["3404089"]},{"name":"Bart Rienties","ids":["2497710"]},{"name":"Denise Whitelock","ids":["1796477"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2908131.2908169"}

During large-scale emergencies, such as natural disasters or armed attacks, victims, responders, and volunteers increasingly use social media to post situation updates and to request and offer help. The use of social media for emergency and disaster response has been a prominent application of information and knowledge management techniques in recent years. There are a number of challenges associated with near real-time processing of vast volumes of information in a way that makes sense for people directly affected, for volunteer organizations, and for official emergency response agencies. As massive amount of messages posted by users are transformed into semi-structured records via information extraction and natural language processing techniques, there is a growing need for developing advanced techniques to aggregate this large-scale data to gain an understanding of the ``big picture'' of an emergency, and to detect and predict how a disaster could develop. This workshop seeks to provide a platform for the exchange of ideas, identification of important problems, and discovery of possible synergies. It will enable interesting discussions and encouraged collaboration between various disciplines, and information and knowledge management approaches is the core of this workshop.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"The Fourth International Workshop on Social Web for Disaster Management (SWDM 2016)","journalPages":"2503-2504","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2988535"],"entities":["Aggregate data","Information extraction","Knowledge management","Knowledge spillover","Natural language processing","Real-time computing","Real-time locating system","Semiconductor industry","Smartphone","Social media","Synergy"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"0c2b8c24ee758a21b4b7c3d5e5be1972953464f0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0c2b8c24ee758a21b4b7c3d5e5be1972953464f0","authors":[{"name":"Carlos Castillo","ids":["1785067"]},{"name":"Fernando Diaz","ids":["37064554"]},{"name":"Yu-Ru Lin","ids":["34821764"]},{"name":"Jie Yin","ids":["2965064"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2988535"}

Topic models, on the other hand, discover semantic topic-based information among words. In this paper, we consider term-based information and semantic information as two features of query terms and propose a simple enhancement for ad-hoc IR via topic modeling. In particular, three topic-based hybrid models, LDA-BM25, LDA-MATF and LDA-LM, are proposed. A series of experiments on eight standard datasets show that our proposed models can always outperform significantly the corresponding strong baselines over all datasets in terms of MAP and most of datasets in terms of P@5 and P@20. A direct comparison on eight standard datasets also indicates our proposed models are at least comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches.","inCitations":["efe1d6bc194f664f3f0950b549e12dd98968d28d","b442769fabac79935a5eeb68705c57098129c461","fbc9d89325b38f1d55e9558686d359851617e2e2","c192c74d67fe95186b57c55824fcbdfaf5fb093e","e1342dd95ca47ccfc1531b62c41c39ce7869c50e","fd4b94a3406c5b12db649750e95abb3a7882d38b","9130ed011369ee8c4853b562309289488fb5949a"],"pmid":"","title":"A Simple Enhancement for Ad-hoc Information Retrieval via Topic Modelling","journalPages":"733-736","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914748"],"entities":["Bag-of-words model","Experiment","Hoc (programming language)","Information retrieval","Linear discriminant analysis","Okapi BM25","Topic model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3eae360c6ee52950f27f577aedd5f9934a04e137","17348f199c626ae1c276a2f90e2627e1b2ceead5","40185b6207f31d3a3813c35972daffa2878549ce","55350454ca7d41f0a5c900bccbe4d0225986281e","ca13a2ae71c3f32e4685942e45e6d20e04d6a042","31d2f3d6cd84381c3641c0e91d2ff708ddee6cb7","7d986dac610e20441adb9161e5466c88932626e9","0ef311acf523d4d0e2cc5f747a6508af2c89c5f7","148c88ef5f96faa76f77b0317a2d8c683a067bdd","8b1a32cea07543865f787cd78804c01ccb7d1c2f","fd6b91c8f781dc64e4567067fd412c3cdcc6d9c2","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","4f6fea3f5111830279735e5f85ec878a4a669a1c","215aa495b4c860a1e6d87f2c36f34da464376cc4","d2d1f7e34d3cedc2f7815200f0eaf87dd19e743f","dd198de2cb38bea670af2cb0ce21f11cf8f27349","8101b548f5b2eae2591dfdd989f6c15b9a4cdefb","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","3a747eb5c61260040f4e811e527c5388cd6e800f","9ac84646f4910ee168be8c20ee6077fd08a1017c"],"id":"8cd03153a17392987eb0d17f37d621796fea9d80","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8cd03153a17392987eb0d17f37d621796fea9d80","authors":[{"name":"Fanghong Jian","ids":["3430616"]},{"name":"Xiangji Huang","ids":["6743849"]},{"name":"Jiashu Zhao","ids":["1732713"]},{"name":"Tingting He","ids":["38658529"]},{"name":"Po Hu","ids":["3239182"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2914748"}

Compared with sponsored search keyword targeting and contextual advertising page content targeting, user behaviour targeting builds users\u2019 interest profiles via tracking their online behaviour and then delivers the relevant ads according to each user\u2019s interest, which leads to higher targeting accuracy and thus more improved advertising performance. The current user profiling methods include building keywords and topic tags or mapping users onto a hierarchical taxonomy. However, to our knowledge, there is no previous work that explicitly investigates the user online visits similarity and incorporates such similarity into their ad response prediction. In this work, we propose a general framework which learns the user profiles based on their online browsing behaviour, and transfers the learned knowledge onto prediction of their ad response. Technically, we propose a transfer learning model based on the probabilistic latent factor graphic models, where the users\u2019 ad response profiles are generated from their online browsing profiles. The large-scale experiments based on real-world data demonstrate significant improvement of our solution over some strong baselines.","inCitations":["208491eb478e89ef154b207a04b45c228362c56d","703372e3b7e0a009ee8d1dceef1627685cae780c","74e9ceed553eb362488a8c810a2c6655b4e6e18d","1ca2086dec3b100e87d16d725b3f7559113c000b"],"pmid":"","title":"Implicit Look-alike Modelling in Display Ads: Transfer Collaborative Filtering to CTR Estimation","journalPages":"589-601","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/085e/ac4857ed7b8f3651129376621a58092a3a7e.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02377","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02377v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_43","http://wnzhang.net/share/rtb-papers/cf-ctr.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02377v1.pdf"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Collaborative filtering","Contextual advertising","Experiment","Monoid factorisation","Nonlinear system","Online advertising","Search engine marketing","Sensor","User profile","Web page"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1e06ef68559a8496650008a8ebbd41a47b1ec89e","47bfb230261b48f2a910f73fc82b0a7a26e1dee5","4a232361675d6ef76a8e3f3443e5399dbcb7e71b","a9472100a5f2f576cfa417aef37e488953b9a63a","c14ef7b146b13086159c5ce104db046a27b3e21c","34ddb4d6b98a45b24b9645b5c52b1d3424ba24f5","32f01f0132d456bd271296281b3e1380db39389e","797b2bcbedc2b650fff4622b88a3d0d13110c19b","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","5776373e3e6c3a619252e2c132b5a4414d6c2271","505253630ab7e8f35e26e27904bd3c8faea3c5ce","2ef7d506b25731d0f3ec0c8f90b718b6e5bbd069","36df8d7a778489d565715f273b82ea82acb71b2f","1ff88585ce3fd5fdaab6573722d4874641359951","9eed333dcaade2c1dd32590eff6b0c0e670a5674","c454d47e23133fc6a6b96452691de1ba760391ad","467568f1777bc51a15a5100516cd4fe8de62b9ab","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","6f2338e8e084fa589fe2a7c30625acdd4cf62514","1f6fc0ac9a5276ba98693b108f26ad557afa2f14","3168dcbdce9ba0f8076133da4ffa6e6732484a4a","039ce79349302a2f124014304279c5e23d39da63","bc06b93bef039012c516130556e4125d1ec7bd0d","a25fbcbbae1e8f79c4360d26aa11a3abf1a11972","daf9ed5dc6c6bad5367d7fd8561527da30e9b8dd","128fab3638f9fbe5939c5eca71a7aea5dc8d3a06","a9ffc6f690c0159ac3266b4386ec9cbdfa6f2f9a","1cea62d9d9436fe78ed83676a7102a46a7f5446b"],"id":"085eac4857ed7b8f3651129376621a58092a3a7e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/085eac4857ed7b8f3651129376621a58092a3a7e","authors":[{"name":"Weinan Zhang","ids":["8031058"]},{"name":"Lingxi Chen","ids":["49330538"]},{"name":"Jun Wang","ids":["39055225"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_43"}

However, some merchants might not have much online content (e.g. customer reviews, business descriptions, opening hours, telephone numbers, etc.). This can pose a problem for traditional local search algorithms such as vector space based approaches. With this difficulty in mind, in this paper we present an approach to local search that incorporates geographic open data. Using the publicly available Yelp dataset we are able to uncover patterns that link geographic features and user preferences. From this, we propose a model to infer user preferences that integrates geographic parameters. Through this model and estimation of user preference, we develop a new framework for \u201clocal\u201d (in the sense of geography) search that offsets the absence of contexts regarding physical business units. Our initial analysis points to the meaningful integration of open geographic data in local search and points out several directions for further research.","inCitations":["27c34a07bd00bfbcb92916244a8654ad15c790ee"],"pmid":"","title":"Improving Local Search with Open Geographic Data","journalPages":"635-640","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a272/a73f549044b891ddb909c2abe581b82375b8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2890482","http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p635.pdf"],"entities":["Customer relationship management","Local search (constraint satisfaction)","Local search (optimization)","Search algorithm","Telephone number","User (computing)","Web content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d0abc79e040cc1a2cdb027ac5983edee071b1c1c","01ad75f24ba1da988b0faaba738bb1504ef565c1","e9142faf49477a8ddd3b438ba150442b5690371e","7aa5c047198a4bcf0e1785edca9326931b455b02","28ff091bab21241a1e0bfe98efc986a83e3f8518","af44e6cbadb69b8df59f7991efa96e933765ed73","512a9d3b1a70bd986c783f1313ae1c0cf7f5e2bf","046c4fd0259e017100140b56cc4a2722fc2ad225"],"id":"a272a73f549044b891ddb909c2abe581b82375b8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a272a73f549044b891ddb909c2abe581b82375b8","authors":[{"name":"Chuankai An","ids":["40578408"]},{"name":"Dan Rockmore","ids":["32132688"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2890482"}

Another domain which has seen comparatively less research on expertise retrieval is academic search. In this paper, we describe the Lattes Expertise Retrieval (LExR) test collection for research on academic expertise retrieval. LExR has been designed to provide a large-scale benchmark for two complementary expertise retrieval tasks, namely, expert profiling and expert finding. Unlike currently available test collections, which fully support only one of these tasks, LExR provides graded relevance judgments performed by expert judges separately for each task. In addition, LExR is both cross-organization and cross-area, encompassing candidate experts from all areas of knowledge working in research institutions all over Brazil. As a result, it constitutes a valuable resource for fostering new research directions on expertise retrieval in an academic setting.","inCitations":["1025b0ed98a23a0c0c7474d5880fd53b07b1ac23","72c4ded42d7f65cfe864cd4bc1382cee18e8aacd"],"pmid":"","title":"The LExR Collection for Expertise Retrieval in Academia","journalPages":"721-724","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2911451.2914678"],"entities":["Academic Search","Benchmark (computing)","Information retrieval","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2d2e19cc2da24df9890bb91949269c996567e0e4","1025b0ed98a23a0c0c7474d5880fd53b07b1ac23","1d4a92f0e062373594e81ee57ac762083497b3e0","55321996c373276b9c68f4764582e98244cada35","2dea89497c8736e72d783c3e3bbdc6f2c7883070","6775b71e4d5ad5d9e4a56620b826b53c3c35c218","51ff3219184af173480267036cd62b34943b2ecf","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef"],"id":"eee44a49a1a1c455f10e1b91ff19445d9232363e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eee44a49a1a1c455f10e1b91ff19445d9232363e","authors":[{"name":"Vítor Mangaravite","ids":["40685956"]},{"name":"Rodrygo L.

Previous work by Dalvi et al. [12] has showed that in non-hierarchical semi-supervised classification tasks, the presence of such unanticipated classes can cause semantic drift for seeded classes. The Exploratory learning [12] method was proposed to solve this problem; however it is limited to the flat classification task. This paper builds such exploratory learning methods for hierarchical classification tasks.\n We experimented with subsets of the NELL [8] ontology and text, and HTML table datasets derived from the ClueWeb09 corpus.

In this paper, we propose sentenceLDA, an extension of LDA whose goal is to overcome this limitation by incorporating the structure of the text in the generative and inference processes. We illustrate the advantages of sentenceLDA by comparing it with LDA using both intrinsic (perplexity) and extrinsic (text classification) evaluation tasks on different text collections.","inCitations":["726b5705c2c826b07fbd246adf3c90ccbcafcff6","b920c634741e6f75f75eda81607dc863554d9dd6","1012cab0c954d5fc41cb033f7388a1bfee4c643b","2ad92651ac37ad05b27af0815f7ee30edd3e85e8"],"pmid":"","title":"On a Topic Model for Sentences","journalPages":"921-924","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Marianne.Clausel/Fichiers/SentenceLDA.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00253","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914714","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00253v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00253v1.pdf"],"entities":["Coherence (physics)","Document classification","Generative model","Perplexity","Topic model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["45c56dc268a04c5fc7ca04d7edb985caf2a25093","6fc8f268815bd58a4f2f4d28ec844b1f032e4f4e","ca66a778d56c1b18d4db65482b3af23d842fa113","0602a179593a238a5cc4ef6f8d6df5d37296e391","6cf4decd7819a47e330a5adaafcdbd17dea91df4","215aa495b4c860a1e6d87f2c36f34da464376cc4","9f40ec54a840c77b7c4dcaa830c77e737adf57da","45c8591533ee33e154167401d4f2e7331b82ada5","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","0d6c1e648edc33433c8ff487edc9241d4498e109"],"id":"0b39bf429aa9ac8b170caf9233d553220716ce31","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0b39bf429aa9ac8b170caf9233d553220716ce31","authors":[{"name":"Georgios Balikas","ids":["1951080"]},{"name":"Massih-Reza Amini","ids":["36617880"]},{"name":"Marianne Clausel","ids":["2889171"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2914714"}

Our results indicate that the term association graphs constructed from document collections using information theoretic measures are nearly as effective as knowledge graphs for Web collections, while the term graphs derived from DBpedia, Freebase and ConceptNet are more effective than term association graphs for newswire collections.

Lookup searches are well served by optimising the precision and recall of search results, however, for exploratory search this may be counterproductive if users are unable to formulate an appropriate search query. We present a system called PULP that supports exploratory search for scientific literature, though the system can be easily adapted to other types of literature. PULP uses reinforcement learning (RL) to avert the user from context traps resulting from poorly chosen search queries, trading off between exploration (presenting the user with diverse topics) and exploitation (moving towards more specific topics). Where other RL-based systems suffer from the \"cold start\" problem, requiring sufficient time to adjust to a user's information needs, PULP initially presents the user with an overview of the dataset using temporal topic models. Topic models are displayed in an interactive alluvial diagram, where topics are shown as ribbons that change thickness with a given topics relative prevalence over time. Interactive, exploratory search sessions can be initiated by selecting topics as a starting point.","inCitations":["68cf0194762455b681ebaf2208051edfdf4ad7bc","c863048c11b47d663b818c8e6c3164cfdd1c8b2e","b27383eb5376cda89fc0b758585b7b8211a50023","40a1ce9fc656a82fc209436641aafbb7bedcc67d","ccdcd37c9d14632d9aca46bd90c277b764104372"],"pmid":"","title":"PULP: A System for Exploratory Search of Scientific Literature","journalPages":"1133-1136","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2911455"],"entities":["Cold start","Diagram","Exploratory search","Information needs","Information retrieval","Interactivity","Lookup table","Precision and recall","Reinforcement learning","Scientific literature","Thickness (graph theory)","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["03d4051ffa6ced1f4616805ceb2b85208fe28d20","57d7dc2a05d7d4007c4291b95a27f5eecadfb232","60c494327a4080cff5381c64fd76c2d971fb3371","1c5c6b62c3b3979b386439238daf3173b3349636","f437e7206f25a1494f580a2a94b1dc4fc554cee5","4c78c530cd487ad968bdd3fd22777265557d65b8","2de7a4e95144acb10400280559427d13b4f07040","80676b9c23d161fd1d6da43936d8393502eca6af","b40567c71269c01c57330cce321d9147bc62a2e8","659a5a8db156804054016f9803f7ea290625d430","103f6fe35033f9327611ddafde74a2b544072980","2cf9714cb82974c85c99a5f3bfe5cd79de52bd69","dcba142b5e027f66b981133348d220da4c12e27c","669da3587fd43abfa79d4548e2a722e6fa35f0bc","6379c75c9ee3397ffd3c2ad1be8da3279140349f","26ed19606a57d837b4b9dcc984ff61763cdd0d36","45958fc457c72ca69a855c66b11b8a2d7b8aa829","02f0a599d04e889615778886370d4fb359bde0b2","92af2d0fd422d8ff70fce1c748e6b581d52d2c35","5ba7592fe3310106543cffad644addeffc2ad2b3"],"id":"789b1595fbb5a1ff0d9c078a48853e62147303e0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/789b1595fbb5a1ff0d9c078a48853e62147303e0","authors":[{"name":"Alan Medlar","ids":["3222337"]},{"name":"Kalle Ilves","ids":["3205169"]},{"name":"Ping Wang","ids":["1689500"]},{"name":"Wray L.

In the past few years we have witnessed dramatic advances in the field of query intent mining area. In this paper, we present a practical system\u2014 StarrySky for identifying and inferring millions of query intents in daily sponsored search with high precision and acceptable coverage. We have already achieved great advantages by deploying this system in Sogou sponsored search engine. The general architecture of StarrySky consists of three stages. First, we detect millions of fine-grained query clusters from two years of click logs which can represent different query intents. Second, we refine the qualities of query clusters with a series of well-designed operations, and call the final refined clusters as concepts. Third and foremost, we build a flexible real-time inference algorithm for assigning query intents to the detected concepts with high precision. Beyond the description of the system, we employ several experiments to evaluate its performance and flexibility. Our inference algorithm achieves up to 96% precision and 68% coverage on daily search requests. We believe StarrySky is a practical and valuable system for tracking query intents.","inCitations":["c45a10dc19444b2bb7fa7f4b527d056abe69e624","55c693b35657937d964e9a348299f61a97f9e41b"],"pmid":"","title":"StarrySky: A Practical System to Track Millions of High-Precision Query Intents","journalPages":"961-966","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1b46/33dc720a7e49677a16372a3dd0efb6a65195.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p961.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2890588"],"entities":["Algorithm","Experiment","Foremost","Query optimization","Real-time locating system","Search engine marketing","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","05a50c5951ba0ce813897ca674282977e9ec367d","39bdad55f51584dab1b62ea5e9ad1002765d7c51","a0a2b72bdcb8476acb1da57a58af068ecc5251ea","93a8d60f1ee97f50529ca382ec5a5353601c17d0","9975e9b3c1ab964f86bf4a553ce23cec43b567bc","9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d","2c3e353019d7882e30e945215f343ee20a1016ad","773d05ce44a138b6499b96919c5ceefeae6850c3","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","858ecc5ed6f6e60d2ac8f87b77a5960b2370a126","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","8907ed38d6f9c56aa406704c7354afd2472d364e","39433dcfe25535df4398742432f2fb11330b0097","5e9fa46f231c59e6573f9a116f77f53703347659","3a472b537a04ec7d477d441c96841d7da56e6a9a","49637c41f2dace98c897d2c637e75508fc833d9d","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","ab6f4fcb9ef8bcfbdc81d4b2210c07eae19006de"],"id":"1b4633dc720a7e49677a16372a3dd0efb6a65195","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1b4633dc720a7e49677a16372a3dd0efb6a65195","authors":[{"name":"Qi Ye","ids":["2718014"]},{"name":"Feng Wang","ids":["47939010"]},{"name":"Bo Li","ids":["2485552"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2890588"}

Existing non-semantic risk prediction tools are typically based on hardcoded scientific knowledge, and only cover a very limited range of patient states. This makes them rapidly out of date, and limited in application, particularly for patients with multiple co-occurring conditions. In this work we propose an integration of Semantic Web and Quantified Self technologies to create a framework for calculating clinical risk predictions for patients based on selfgathered biometric data. This framework relies on generic, reusable ontologies for representing clinical risk, and sensor readings, and reasoning to support the integration of data represented according to these ontologies. The implemented framework shows a wide range of advantages over existing risk calculation.","inCitations":["264f422ee2882397a2e17b2204e2996668ab30f8","ffaef7f3604fb4e97a39b9032928b47fa422099c"],"pmid":"","title":"Integrating Medical Scientific Knowledge with the Semantically Quantified Self","journalPages":"566-580","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/df0c/fc06528cb62fd213178b301b3ae4cd672a7b.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://videolectures.net/site/normal_dl/tag=1086387/iswc2016_third_scientific_knowledge_01.pdf","http://oro.open.ac.uk/52927/7/52927.pdf","https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/61031417/ISWC2016.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_34"],"entities":["Biometrics","ENCODE","Financial risk modeling","Hard coding","Human-readable medium","Knowledge management","Observable","Ontology (information science)","Quantified Self","Risk management","Semantic Web","Traceability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["779fa0c09a0ca589008703ab2c165cd06ae805b1","138cd455848eca1d2efe3fb0490e75dd37de88c3","edade65419cd45194895ba7cb600b4ad5c95a63b","0155d30fa40e5d34dc92ac737ab4a6b869b19721","a5232db766ea33124b7ef7b2ab64d77eccf228ce","b153e178630209bb09d4e675e3dc30a2af0cbfb5","8f2e56ed488400431533922383cce16fd124a5be","3df3143323a84e4f32b8759ea1fd1b46f03cb6b8","20ad6a869a564a127704d43fd6eddb25613b916f","35191952115a43c3893e6865ebf9fdca7c15739a","1b050c9252c286ba722176f97d40c4a6af8ce80c"],"id":"92e679b5d755cea799f16712909ddd8d54cc3a09","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/92e679b5d755cea799f16712909ddd8d54cc3a09","authors":[{"name":"Allan Third","ids":["2906456"]},{"name":"George Gkotsis","ids":["2221116"]},{"name":"Eleni Kaldoudi","ids":["1744789"]},{"name":"George Drosatos","ids":["1727751"]},{"name":"Nick Portokallidis","ids":["3470602"]},{"name":"Stefanos Roumeliotis","ids":["3388538"]},{"name":"Kalliopi Pafili","ids":["3470239"]},{"name":"John Domingue","ids":["1694523"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_34"}

Understanding the causes of this gender imbalance would inform both policies intended to rectify it and employment decisions by departments and individuals. Progress in this direction, however, is complicated by the complexity and decentralized nature of faculty hiring and the non-independence of hires. Using comprehensive data on both hiring outcomes and scholarly productivity for 2659 tenure-track faculty across 205 Ph.D.-granting departments in North America, we investigate the multidimensional nature of gender inequality in computer science faculty hiring through a network model of the hiring process. Overall, we find that hiring outcomes are most directly affected by (i) the relative prestige between hiring and placing institutions and (ii) the scholarly productivity of the candidates. After including these, and other features, the addition of gender did not significantly reduce modeling error. However, gender differences do exist, e.g., in scholarly productivity, postdoctoral training rates, and in career movements up the rankings of universities, suggesting that the effects of gender are indirectly incorporated into hiring decisions through gender\u2019s covariates. Furthermore, we find evidence that more highly ranked departments recruit female faculty at higher than expected rates, which appears to inhibit similar efforts by lower ranked departments. These findings illustrate the subtle nature of gender inequality in faculty hiring networks and provide new insights to the underrepresentation of women in computer science.","inCitations":["ba88c36083ded9d28b1ca176696fe5aeaf9ec88d","6036f51686004c1fe50dbc98c6e788497e1ee0d5","b023189207aab55efb7b337d959dd951743dd113","4987db338b6db1006b94b845d229c2a528967a37","accadf2bdd4fdb2748e05e866e908f8e899f2cc4","150c7c726845c837e9b3775c9f3987d53e55af8e","46c95e7ed148c6bb037ab4fc24afbcd117761b2b","5b2001eccbefbf7357ba28789862b8be8da891e6","abfb1eb2d27194269503afce8be45909c8f86f4b","005feeabbd9ab5de9885f39f6a23228d1fff9410","2fea90d961d274f851a15f260ba132b360f87af7"],"pmid":"","title":"Gender, Productivity, and Prestige in Computer Science Faculty Hiring Networks","journalPages":"1169-1179","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e45a/90164eb9ae8bbd90633a63d4e65051b065fd.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p1169.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2872427.2883073","http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00795","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00795v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00795v1.pdf"],"entities":["Complexity","Computer science","Network model","Social inequality","Women in computing"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3719ca6d56454df4fdaf081f342bf25d95b1316b","fd352d18ecbb3a046ac5143b8a4367892332995b","f56e675d76327c222d45771795e63b0503390cd0","62fdc78fdab1475c1e413a984606b38d7192970c","6426a2de7f7f71e00bbce122d741c106d0a217ae","0e84e22e7890e41f82dc7af0f55c39b9e00f9e2d","1e63600b5906a6e18c2b9540155b9adb85c4d437","036f0ca97a2388b46bcc85e00cc13be0343a553c","000db866bac72f8eaa26b567b2f1bc613449a003","e02b8efda7d902a20dfabf3953c3013b312378e5","395960dba1a121d72bf68e4b1ec1b71e9d903417","53d2357241cae91ac4d97f0e2967baa10ec73102","7cb24559398e4b4e01cb0f33cb0e148919535710","053f32fa089043cc958b4b7374a831c6732e38b5","99e410a96d627f525dbb605dac9f057d406e7943","fa8b027d549b523706ce7c2ed169198ba5ce84a8","4f93bc30eb51e31685c7372709f81ad50773237f","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","071ae197a35fb958c03a6697d2f35caa63d2c00a","e6271ad244ee231f2d2d441c57f54cbaf43aca8e","773912d0827c4bc5ad332f405bbe0f28d252bb7d","f0c3edcdc1c33a2098894691696c2e5b0e7a10ae","0fb0781cac8b3caac879f19d53cce72bd3de2397","240d5fe54fa3c9612e67d8d3a6a077d2175ef29d","bbad05137f5b4d8fea08f7792c0cb3a85cbf6784"],"id":"821e67c9ed6301582aa8e5ab48e2b2280d137f01","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/821e67c9ed6301582aa8e5ab48e2b2280d137f01","authors":[{"name":"Samuel F.

This means that there are many different possible sequences of interactions which could be taken (some ending in success and others ending in failure). Simulation provides a low cost, repeatable and reproducible way to explore a large range of different possibilities. This makes simulation very appealing, but it also requires care and consideration in developing, implementing and instantiating models of user behaviour for the purposes of experimentation.\n In this tutorial, we aim to provide researchers with an overview of simulation, detailing the various types of simulation, models of search behavior used to simulate interaction, along with an overview of the various models of querying, stopping, selecting and marking. Through the course of the tutorial we will describe various studies and how they have used simulation to explore different behaviours and aspects of the search process. The final section of the tutorial will be dedicated to \"best practice\" and how to build, ground and validate simulations. The tutorial will conclude with a demonstration of an open source simulation framework that can be used develop various kinds of simulations.","inCitations":["346a0ff5743e36f227f1a3df0fafb43c8631c559","b7a31cf3af58106b024515a40f8975da5c5f0527","8e00f88a2defab710f8af071b674c77dc38424db"],"pmid":"","title":"Simulation of Interaction: A Tutorial on Modelling and Simulating User Interaction and Search Behaviour","journalPages":"1227-1230","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914799"],"entities":["Best practice","Instance (computer science)","Interaction","Item Unique Identification","Open-source software","Simulation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["370106149cd68b0f85f6d8f27cb3530eaea9f980","a0d2d94b212f94804ec42d9c6d3455a1b7455c02","9ef718f135208715c0b5e292ae6cd201c02b9bd0","a0adfb16b951556630aab2a756724830040ebc99","277eac493f4fa6d37126d8cf1f2fea76d3c13441","9fdd5e7cbc13df1ed1323fe4b3496ea004df8112","6d50299f8848147a47fd6193abe7e8568fc307d7","7f8dce0cc57e01c7631bfe0622f07a6ccd58aea1","af8682a46decaf7d6696b8c17e85ec105a307ac3","0d7b45aaf305481acfa09e608bf39759f81873d2","ede44a9b6eb7edaba27d415d9f8960bde56d0589","2de7acf5c655c2e5fdab2e373e9b2fc0f9adb469","448345e5386edac7942b26227610053be7563f23","9e818e1a3a3ae9ef4408fba999f03726004f55f4","60a57db6ef046956e5ffcb495e1fe002f3bb07f2","4ec3ed2512eed206419746e0ed960709c2c4728f","396b68b315083ee5cb0c02d3187d517fafcdebf3","0b5b0a9309dc314d9040772132ab14071d3daf43","78f43b29c83a10c50eb02f3043ee18b0308c536c","8cad9314134f6c423f59f102266ac0d0e33f7656","e4ed0c7de1260e8a81966863c5c27175b14ff5fe","0430b75968181778ff933dbfaba973dd9a4c0cd4","c19c4fc1a79550bd7a10fc6cccd8eadf4057866d","b2a9fc7b3c41d4c4b29c41d3e369d50f36f17c0f","bf0e1fe2295661c3800b42255cd78b9920cc4f1c","99f151ef49852bc136f92fe5677a9288841e1cab","c73c4092e6be26751a25b3c3ffc6a83652fd29d7","42377db3bb46f768c3aca77159cd4bf2e7096f27","38a5edf6a0e9c2725dfaa69166fab5d78b2aac45","87bffa6fd5de35d351cf80fda2385cc54d2b3fe6","1328e3dd9e4c091461de8644148f8444f05c5757","0353d56503f0418629f8306987d7a99dead41864","28aba9700b0620e2957bc366f7e493419fccf791","bacff358bfd85a4673782c1f56f030283bdaa4e5","d4f2f0b971984fa5235ccd76a8bb1441a736bfa5","50fd264bacd38ecea8815230d0c6d60364901f63","c6761a6116d68e174facd6a49318055ec068f00f","88fbf478fd5d0baa2c1d5cc6d0b7daea38893a89","c76cc40b0642510ca30b1cc29aa535ed5539f254","591ddf63c86c71afb3eb67af48d218c89b916448","a8dce9c1a14721ceff9d01a646bc94634d3e12d6","33f5ff21cf30836b640847f2077a5c6196081ad2","b22d4e6c69e3e0c6aebd6a6ff7e75c1a2565d7b1","2298858cff70b83ba3afdbda8079f1b7258e75a3","98dbd1bcbc36bd1d219b8da019a5854765784ca3"],"id":"57d82c98b91512090d3971ae0d63f139d5ab0081","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57d82c98b91512090d3971ae0d63f139d5ab0081","authors":[{"name":"Leif Azzopardi","ids":["1716332"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2914799"}

In this paper, we present a novel approach to person name disambiguation and linking that uses a large-scale social network extracted from the English Wikipedia. First, possible candidate matches for an ambiguous person name are determined. With each candidate match, a network substructure is associated. Based on the similarity between these network substructures and the latent network of an ambiguous person name in a document, we propose an efficient ranking method to resolve the ambiguity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, resulting in an overall precision of over 96% for disambiguating person names and linking them to real world entities.","inCitations":["98f9abf292629e7fbc056e3fab5102a902f2e7df","e7f79e6e661621d36d4b8b972c49c3acfc0a01fa","13ed6918985318fdc173e7082000b39097a988b3"],"pmid":"","title":"With a Little Help from my Neighbors: Person Name Linking Using the Wikipedia Social Network","journalPages":"985-990","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0d2e/07b99ab25488a7ddde87475f3cad7cc549fa.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p985.pdf","http://snap.stanford.edu/wikiworkshop2016/papers/Wiki_Workshop__WWW_2016_paper_1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2891109","http://wikiworkshop.org/2016/papers/Wiki_Workshop__WWW_2016_paper_1.pdf","https://dbs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/files/Team/jgeiss/presentations/wiki01_Geiss.pdf"],"entities":["Entity linking","Named entity","Social network","Wikipedia","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2f31e57555705537cc0274ce45086598ff6e9ec5","759f0ec45e3b62254a9a3461240f47f5eaf21f7f","1b22f2e888e8bc0c4a16001cf468cbdcad0e8936","293da28d4da1feb9ec2ca61124b53b6299538d29","4015bce2713d4e5a6d78b05989d28763e763547d","8967e8b7d3e6f900de9fab7d30a90e46d7c1a979","0a78ce6de6f2d56e28bd71ba178e729aea8d5221","f7e84681d9d2119adb2aecfbeb4fcb24c650e1ce","1d2a4018b4fc6a5f498e65d68260615dbc9e7ec6","07c315d80e1f282aabc45c40d92fcdcc83fb569e","6c5dacc913ba083f040210440f1230ec769fa260","f8989d9fd475230d692f02095df991a5590ba56d","49f5c13f2958b4eab818cde8fdaf8f0a3e3c94ec","4f410ab5c8b12b34b38421241366ee456bbebab9","07abd02f02774d178f26ca99937e5f94001a9ec9","1c909ac1c331c0c246a88da047cbdcca9ec9b7e7","27495dddc78e834b890f0a50e1936c82d0de83d7","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","35f1e2cf22f32a206270967174334fd27733163b","04fdbced9fd88ba06097910a8fead3ebf6a47c04","5b35981142209ad7d003ec4341b64f9a04005e10","92f0af4fe05bf61ecd10ba9ab3d06030c784a09d"],"id":"af6faf07cd8773deb989ac7775f847e46c5f0ed9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/af6faf07cd8773deb989ac7775f847e46c5f0ed9","authors":[{"name":"Johanna Geiß","ids":["32579630"]},{"name":"Michael Gertz","ids":["40136143"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2891109"}

The use case in this paper is the social bookmarking system Bib-Sonomy, which received over 150 times more registrations from spam users than from normal users over the last ten years.\n A common approach to fight spam is to use machine learning to classify the users into good or malicious users. Based on information the users provide to the service in form of profile information or posts, features are created from which a classifier can make its decision. However, this often means that the accounts of the spam users are already active and can post their spam. In this work we propose an approach for deciding at registration time whether a user is malicious or not. In order to achieve this goal, we extracted 177 features from the information the users provide during the registration process, their IP address, and registration time. With these features we used state-of-the-art classifiers to identify users as spammers or regular users. With the best classifier, we could reach an AUC of 0.912.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"You shall not pass: detecting malicious users at registration time","journalPages":"2:1-2:6","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~jaeschke/pdf/kater2016detecting.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2915368.2915370"],"entities":["E-services","Machine learning","Malware","Sensor","Spamming","Statistical classification"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d93fa4eb446cf5a7661c6ced05eafe63fd1ad09c","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","4ed39647860ef24f4302d62b7161da665474541e","3334a80676fefc486575bd2ddf1b281a640742f1","4400658488127b99c76c513340e493955b1ef0e3","a961a3a38db75b962dcdf56456aa149c4f5f3257","111662603398c3f38547212d714e50884e6195f3","1d66b3ded61d2f82285b6f5903534125e3e31a0f"],"id":"1bfa45d4ddc51d43dcc332209e9b699faee8d1a6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1bfa45d4ddc51d43dcc332209e9b699faee8d1a6","authors":[{"name":"Christian Kater","ids":["40470384"]},{"name":"Robert Jäschke","ids":["5111790"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2915368.2915370"}

The number of companies that are interested in the general opinion of the crowd regarding the items that they sell is increasing everyday. Attribute-based polarity analysis is a fine-grained approach that computes if the opinion about an attribute of (a component of) an item is positive, negative, or neutral. The existing techniques have a number of problems, namely: they do not take into account the conditions expressed in the opinions (e.g., when they hold and when they do not), they do not generally use any contextual information (e.g., past user opinions on the same attribute), and they are not validated on big datasets (e.g., billions of messages).

It is clear that the standard organization of a search engine results page (SERP), consisting of an ordered list of hits, is inadequate to support the needs of scholars.

We elaborate on this by highlighting the importance of the temporal dimension of web pages as well as issues surrounding metadata and veracity.","inCitations":["b1d240d8d42f2f88a10002d00179bacc232ed830","2f1313a596b8dec0b7605053804c4b736bb68c8b","b87d31f813b68cf25bb3842ea227ed0acfd695b1","56b0126b1faf39da50cae97e7fdace7dbffa845c","40a1ce9fc656a82fc209436641aafbb7bedcc67d","0c71a3713a75c6190602ec341f25a7e2f0c3a16c","4e54c8387ce23fb20578527c13b5f58969943203"],"pmid":"","title":"Desiderata for exploratory search interfaces to Web archives in support of scholarly activities","journalPages":"103-106","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7559570/","https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Jackson_etal_JCDL2016.pdf"],"entities":["Addendum","Archive","Exploratory search","Information seeking","Organizing (structure)","Search engine results page","Semiconductor memory","Veracity","Web archiving","Web content","Web page","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e9efa29945c7f29478971155cdac77236f50bba1","2cbf666423f44b17db4ef8698dcaf6c50a6a2825","7bba909bc4f20a43e021b1f6fb36dfbf03503a8c","c1eeca1d62a132eb1dca91e22772ab42011dc4f7","7601c22e8f5f1b2e07e6ea72614e27da16005d22","3a19bb1427d754b9b994cbe2b93154bd4971fd5c","26e09f13106ecbd7d6131d45108d65d101801378","330ce6e1e4b725c39699e1ff119df0de81a17bb3","4b4afd45404d2fd994c5bd0fb79181e702594b61","064f9e6f1db223cc761c7a98126b9337b833a9e9","163412c36842753dadfd109d5ef06333d7ee3be8","402f416cc03837fb1b27e960a6290fd00cac4f9f","15ff9117898937deeeda9a25e07e6e1025e9fcbf","7f23e86082befcdfe88d9b173c00d05a35ea5de3","1c1ff09e4b08918a093d307b2bcef62a1618fe99"],"id":"43b0a56c5fbe20fe64940f8550baffd35a9111d1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/43b0a56c5fbe20fe64940f8550baffd35a9111d1","authors":[{"name":"Andrew Jackson","ids":["33630124"]},{"name":"Jimmy J.

Usage stats show that our new X1 TV platform receives millions of voice queries per day. As a result, expanding the coverage of our voice interface provides a critical competitive advantage, allowing customers to speak freely instead of having to stick to a rigid set of commands. The ultimate objective is to provide a more natural user experience and increase access to our knowledge graph (KG) and entertainment platform.\n We describe a real-time factoid question answering (QA) system, using our internal KG for training (i.e., generating labeled example question-answer pairs) and for retrieval at test time. We hope that this will inspire other companies to take advantage of readily available unlabeled data, machine learning and search technologies to build products that can improve customer experiences.Our approach consists of two steps: First, two neural network models are trained to predict a structured query from the free-form input question. Then, a search through all facts in the KG retrieves answers consistent with the structured query.","inCitations":["c8565e84f97173144a396a63bcdfaa76c583f251"],"pmid":"","title":"Ask Your TV: Real-Time Question Answering with Recurrent Neural Networks","journalPages":"457-458","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2926729"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Kasparov's Gambit","Knowledge Graph","Machine learning","Neural Networks","Question answering","Real-time clock","Real-time transcription","Recurrent neural network","User experience"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1ef01e7bfab2041bc0c0a56a57906964df9fc985","6e565308c8081e807709cb4a917443b737e6cdb4","0ec80f1e6f7dfbbbcc97459d4c5ae13be1cadc7b"],"id":"35503304ac0c2448358a145a63f83ef82d34b05b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/35503304ac0c2448358a145a63f83ef82d34b05b","authors":[{"name":"Ferhan Türe","ids":["2851411"]},{"name":"Oliver Jojic","ids":["2226722"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2926729"}

A/B testing is a popular tool for comparing the performance of different variants. Despite the widespread use of A/B tests, there is little research on how to assert the validity of such tests. Even small changes in the application\u2019s user base, hardor software stack not related to the variants under test can transform on possibly hidden paths into significant disturbances of the overall evaluation criterion (OEC) of an A/B test and, hence, invalidate such a test. Therefore, the highly dynamic server and client run-time environments of modern web applications make it difficult to assert correctly the validity of an A/B test. We propose the concept of test context to capture data relevant for the chosen OEC. We use pre-test data for dynamic base-lining of the target space of the system under test and to increase the statistical power. During an A/B experiment, the contexts of each variant are compared to the pre-test context to ensure the validity of the test. We have implemented this method using a generic parameterfree statistical test based on the bootstrap method focussing on frontend performance metrics.","inCitations":["eb3e4562b4551938f559078f7c7d6c3fcec00a4d"],"pmid":"","title":"Context-based A/B Test Validation","journalPages":"277-278","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06dd/b3e38604a6c6f97ec15f6b3124814be31948.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2889306","http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p277.pdf"],"entities":["A/B testing","Bootstrapping (statistics)","OE-Cake!","Server (computing)","Software deployment","System under test","Test data","Test suite","Web application"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["049ba16a73e4493c0d62db369e4f9a1c4820cbb2","e872bac88da785e116643f51e9738ed80906b059","2a20ba8eb62d14675f673e755c901e17b3be8a08"],"id":"06ddb3e38604a6c6f97ec15f6b3124814be31948","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/06ddb3e38604a6c6f97ec15f6b3124814be31948","authors":[{"name":"Michael Nolting","ids":["50054477"]},{"name":"Jan Eike von Seggern","ids":["3390978"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2889306"}

The popularity of pervasively available social activities for social media users has encouraged a large body of literature on exploiting social networks for recommendation. The vast majority of these systems focus on unsigned social networks (or social networks with only positive links), while little work exists for signed social networks (or social networks with positive and negative links). The availability of negative links in signed social networks presents both challenges and opportunities in the recommendation process. We provide a principled and mathematical approach to exploit signed social networks for recommendation, and propose a model, RecSSN, to leverage positive and negative links in signed social networks. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We also perform further experiments to explicitly understand the effect of signed networks in RecSSN.","inCitations":["51ceee6f58202f2082c6c322f5a656434f39e6cb","f48d16a856d1559cd9b2625845d1f74727b53691","f61e203ab7ae485ec52ccda63fc4d1abb23d0d9a","b50e128a7580d5085a876d1027311c733715f4cd","72be1161fa770fbac6cc36cd7ced0b671aa015e1","4bbd12c66e642b74a3efd4981507582f312ae28f","fc5119af511fcfbdd63c7f7fe5fb5cecd52c8685","eee722b1c5adb78ee3584011f614cfdd7a0b7d98","91342d2d127057195f9de487c4a92cf38e91d6b9","d9c293ae351b371c1ef397ef17c7a71af0a56d78","d1f4460091422514b590bea1247f0ca197133b76","ee0fd8f00b3a2cb2505045214cf730704aa3142c","11bb373a47e7399d4068f0488ecae22a3dd141b8","8902f0b0636cfd975500375b180d17b390a3551a","0e443ed401707d9bf95aca485709400d6b5eae63","28f744bf3aa4b4fc8d8ccf61016f2c40b3cc94f7","def5c16ef5607f4599a660285c606c10a656f2ca","162b8c43195545a045a50535daad8844e6b845ec"],"pmid":"","title":"Recommendations in Signed Social Networks","journalPages":"31-40","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7560/e17660af48921da9c36305f9ec4d45642177.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://charuaggarwal.net/p31-tang.pdf","http://www.charuaggarwal.net/p31-tang.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2882971","http://www2016.net/proceedings/proceedings/p31.pdf"],"entities":["Experiment","Information overload","Recommender system","Social media","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["aa377fbda4bbef2abe13ceac1a0dd269e0285af8","11a5a0ec975ae7aec92e7f8a9d4e391eda45ccb4","9b6f9ee2ef50b3831a13e2bc2c662c349b4cd362","122d19f2435cee094b7aaa84c8bb13a8978ddf21","56b20bfbc0f853b0b54c925f979c95cfe4716bfa","2b8d6015f70e885356c84bc5782eaa11d4d90c69","271a06bc0900f28f288dea018507606bdc4d1b3f","05252b795f0f1238ac7e0d7af7fc2372c34a181d","350bdb162f1a02791db10ad887b84fdf231c92e5","4cc352fa9dc7fc87389ce95e6779a2603f4ee87f","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","1001b274f1d7ab16b26a871745b4918999d6d528","4547356cc1e9315a66c7ddffa9362095c3727837","8451c2812a1476d3e13f2a509139322cc0adb1a2","03806d70cf848811dfb9912f8b4529b5282a2c3a","00354cf992faa54b9bb89690976de7f8bd6f0243","50dfb09a4e2fc5916680e949bef9b0101504ea5a","b6dfa48aa6c8452b1b43ae8afe0d7728314a993e","45d84d67870fc5de3b0747d05d9971d750604e7e","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","3bddba3214fe9e7248a934455a2624aa5b781778","91a62654104b681c4b9f19c4e7b9888badaf59dc","64c871cd7e0af7e1aeb94d98c6214eb8d8e8b989","18cac5d010d7a1cf684e9f2bf177843fb8cd1893","9285f3c70c6cab770d2f7d4ccb32ecae0397b134","1e18a71cf45a5b81e64b31a9c330837b0d3c402b","b48228cc730fd1e4bd841033a4ea2889b5000753","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","11bb373a47e7399d4068f0488ecae22a3dd141b8","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20","95f1c2a950811cf86c07e7dac8f00759f6d16853","aad9c378dc1485957ae8d661596462b2ec16ab24","28dd3e75ac352ae448b68a17b78a7e101f50b8fe","38e024c97f0e55097919066b7233a5caa622a62f","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8"],"id":"6808934531ff0d9d3d20a4e71a43a733b556c19c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6808934531ff0d9d3d20a4e71a43a733b556c19c","authors":[{"name":"Jiliang Tang","ids":["1736632"]},{"name":"Charu C.

To facilitate users to find and browse related video contents, video hyperlinking aims at constructing links among video segments with relevant information in a large video collection. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of various video features on the performance of video hyperlinking, including subtitle, metadata, content features (i.e., audio and visual), surrounding context, as well as the combinations of those features. Besides, we also test different search strategies over different types of queries, which are categorized according to their video contents. Comprehensive experimental studies have been conducted on the dataset of TRECVID 2015 video hyperlinking task. Results show that (1) text features play a crucial role in search performance, and the combination of audio and visual features cannot provide improvements; (2) the consideration of contexts cannot obtain better results; and (3) due to the lack of training examples, machine learning techniques cannot improve the performance.","inCitations":["519da94369c1d87e09c592f239b55cc9486b5b7c","1e25bb0b8b6edba35dce803c63d5f9a3a902d2d1","caaf4731094fa2ee52811f60c0daaa65505a0491","62814b0f14cd3616993638c7ddddff25e7af19d7"],"pmid":"","title":"Which Information Sources are More Effective and Reliable in Video Search","journalPages":"1069-1072","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.mysmu.edu/phdis2011/zy.cheng.2011/spr368-cheng.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914765"],"entities":["Browsing","Categorization","Digital video","Hyperlink","Machine learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c1220439a3d0bf90c025d36cde1377ada3744379","1a0d51b07ac326ee94fc6e3a8ceadd4335076cba","6635b9a0a7e689db4bcbb35868afae36f8c58f25","126a643c23daa3c5b08c16de081276bc50892e0a","b6f07514f5c634e3784f1c3558c4ace6b945deb7","a0a7ca8cd3448c5996df79f9badd202c1295cb20","35f3c8659274b67030d12b46ff466f7b3e543037","60326087fc907a58ba52598acf52bab42d1a96e0","10af69f11301679b6fbb23855bf10f6af1f3d2e6","67bab01706d3aada95e383f1296e5f019b869ae6","1ec829cc2371644aaec48c42f92f27b35ad11ae5","14cf2484d4a2741cc778c252e2de2671de349e37","5996001b797ab2a0f55d5355cb168f25bfe56bbd","fc2df90e63ac16cd6934d8572720cb8aa0ec420e","21a275beb31bfa71d9884c993e161578f15caba9","d3008b4122e50a28f6cc1fa98ac6af28b42271ea","870ab9e1d47451114d869414cc0bd62797a96e6f"],"id":"dbbc93afd4b3ac2a9641c6081f1fe75f4a6b2148","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dbbc93afd4b3ac2a9641c6081f1fe75f4a6b2148","authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Cheng","ids":["13167100"]},{"name":"Xuanchong Li","ids":["2314980"]},{"name":"Jialie Shen","ids":["38203359"]},{"name":"Alexander G.

When a user visits a website, the website generally plugs a browser cookie string (`bcookie' for short). The bcookie is then used as an identifier to collect the user's online behavior, as well as the joint key to link user profile attributes, such as demographic information and browsing history. However, the same users can have different bcookies across different browsers and devices. Moreover, bcookies can expire after some period, be cleared by browsers or users. This situation of bcookie discounting typically introduces both performance and delivery problems in online advertising since advertisers are hard to find the most receptive audiences based on the user profile information. In this paper, we try to tackle this problem by using an `assistant identifier' to find the linkage between different bcookies. For most of the Internet company, in addition to the bcookie information, there are always other identifiers such as IP address, user agent, OS type and version, etc., stored in the serving log data. Therefore, we propose an unified framework to link different bcookies from the same users according to those assistant identifiers. Specifically, our proposed method first constructs a bipartite graph with linkages between the assistant identifiers and the bcookies. Next all attributes associated with each bcookie are propagated along the graph using the state-of-the-art random walk model. Offline comparative experimental studies are conducted to confirm that by enriching the bcookie attributes we can recover 20% more online users whose bcookie information is lost, which is greatly helpful to delivery more budget spending with a little loss in precision of predicting converted users. On-product evaluation further confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.","inCitations":["1cc84c9b9ad74e426aee32828e17c54adad7246a"],"pmid":"","title":"Improving Advertisement Recommendation by Enriching User Browser Cookie Attributes","journalPages":"2401-2404","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983374"],"entities":["HTTP cookie","Identifier","Internet","Linkage (software)","Online advertising","Online and offline","Operating system","Unified Framework","User agent","User profile"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ccdaa660c5ce9849013191c6aca366e7099979b3","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","7bc0c35f4f89cafda3dba1900c82ea5838c095bd","0c0800259bd40b1ac96cc437629c5ea0ad729f22","70baffbf8a5fc1663c64892eb58a356ac19df247","05575e85d4b0c09c09552921b2ee0db79e5e9cf9","2bf3fb9d50a39ad727f248ffd4b14f07a2d48e4a"],"id":"98ca33c1a37439d11561863084175a7ff74cbd84","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/98ca33c1a37439d11561863084175a7ff74cbd84","authors":[{"name":"Liang Wang","ids":["1693997"]},{"name":"Kuang-chih Lee","ids":["2457452"]},{"name":"Quan Lu","ids":["50447811"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2983323.2983374"}

Therefore, the integration of (sensor) data is important, as this data is coming from different data sources and might be in different formats. Furthermore, reusable and extensible methods for this integration are required in order to be able to scale with the growing number of applications that generate semantic sensor data. Current research efforts allow to map sensor data to Linked Data in order to provide semantic interoperability. However, they lack support for multiple data sources, hampering the integration. Furthermore, the used methods are not available for reuse or are not extensible, which hampers the development of applications. In this paper, we describe how the rdf Mapping Language (rml) and a Triple Pattern Fragments (tpf) server are used to address these shortcomings. The demonstration consists of a micro controller that generates sensor data. The data is captured and mapped to rdf triples using module-specific rml mappings, which are queried from a tpf server.","inCitations":["6b0b21ee094ce350f816acdf7d2e51b0b524901a"],"pmid":"","title":"Linked Sensor Data Generation using Queryable RML Mappings","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1b91/b26279c58274689b8bf395e5714c506d2108.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1690/paper9.pdf"],"entities":["Linked data","Microcontroller","Minimal mappings","Semantic interoperability","Sensor","Server (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["45898984ffde74182df21ba89c22b3b19d720d00","8064e4256e2c87901cc595a1c2d7f6ae5a73248c","26d6f9a60e4dee8f752c5164b88b884fe40f472e","3cb47d972b017894fafcd82fb7887f04e2f5a14a","fde872d2334f1da6bb4e18c64d3c8039bf788a8c","5418e80e4586b091b71ed5750b46b61ad56e929b","552832bc61bffa7a07f55070a295f14d280244d3"],"id":"1b91b26279c58274689b8bf395e5714c506d2108","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1b91b26279c58274689b8bf395e5714c506d2108","authors":[{"name":"Pieter Heyvaert","ids":["1896690"]},{"name":"Ruben Taelman","ids":["3403873"]},{"name":"Ruben Verborgh","ids":["1723397"]},{"name":"Erik Mannens","ids":["1691320"]}],"doi":""}

Therefore, to understand how and why the Web is evolving, it is imperative to use qualitative methods in conjunction with quantitative approaches. Embracing interdisciplinarity will enrich research. This tutorial aims to provide a basic introduction to qualitative approaches with no previous knowledge being required.\n Using the question \"How Does the Web Impact Eating Habits?\" as the foundation and research topic for this tutorial, participants will be provided with an opportunity to engage in qualitative methods and analysis. Key information will be provided in the form of short presentations, however the tutorial will predominantly take a \"hands on\" approach. Learning by doing, participants will take part in various exercises. The first half of the tutorial will focus on the methods themselves. This includes how to conduct interviews, focus groups, and ethnography. In the second part, participants will explore two examples of methods of analysis: thematic analysis and semiotic analysis. In addition, a keynote will present a discussion of online ethics to prompt thinking about the implications of this emerging context. To conclude, participants will be offered the opportunity to design a research project in small groups considering what they've learnt throughout the tutorial. This will allow them to consolidate their learning.\n Overall, this tutorial will present how qualitative research can complement quantitative methods and provide a mutually illuminating image of a research topic for Web Science.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Utilising online qualitative methods for web science","journalPages":"12","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2908131.2908144"],"entities":["Experience","Focus group","Imperative programming","Semiotics","Situated cognition","Web science","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"c38bbfa149d22c6e174d9e8415e4f44d4cf15d8f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c38bbfa149d22c6e174d9e8415e4f44d4cf15d8f","authors":[{"name":"Laura Hyrjak","ids":["3403652"]},{"name":"Amy Lynch","ids":["50258566"]},{"name":"Sophie Parsons","ids":["39941230"]},{"name":"Lisa Sugiura","ids":["2452331"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2908131.2908144"}

With large knowledge graphs, structured querying on their relational facts is an alternative, but often suffers from poor recall because of mismatches between user queries and the knowledge graph or because of weakly populated relations.\n This paper presents the TriniT search engine for querying and ranking on extended knowledge graphs that combine relational facts with textual web contents. Our query language is designed on the paradigm of SPO triple patterns, but is more expressive, supporting textual phrases for each of the SPO arguments. We present a model for automatic query relaxation to compensate for mismatches between the data and a user's query. Query answers -- tuples of entities -- are ranked by a statistical language model. We present experiments with different benchmarks, including complex relationship queries, over a combination of the Yago knowledge graph and the entity-annotated ClueWeb'09 corpus.","inCitations":["df05e932680d4280253552bba38ea38eeaaab337","0149426acc46840697acd4c60afbc11ab29ed853","691275c189525899271b448041de36c4932deda1","9e992ec8776a4c348cb03acb7c1e2a4307e2f019","3b89f09d82a1b7877bde509df5bea4040c6d1ed9","cdfc7125d6526247bd94afdd6379b3fd6fec5674","07a9d9bf6af8eb5ac734735b8c2ce4c3de095131","a80a0ed4597d0dcb9f8d09009afbfa76e4ef621c","d74692fcb5259e11180dd6abb8955f94e8d22c60","759c0cc2cf7128218160926c37634f0bbd9c7213","5801f66eba3ecfeb78b226c452fb061ae1e591d9","8aef832372c6e3e83f10532f94f18bd26324d4fd","fb680510cdb9f5787ec9e77cb3e0b267472fb4e6","2a24281d0295559ddce940db486b8a49d81933f3","2b2090eab4abe27e6e5e4ca94afaf82e511b63bd","772f69b1dd966610edaa4ef2576d36142dc05928","a30858cc03b0a08614f8fdead1b15245b33eb632","771ed7dc79e9490aaf9e2d0db7d7bf5ad81c641a","ec1cce976a405659d50c1db7c8ffe8a91ce43c02","00a0639b59ac2d44ff9eed3992023265a2d69864","6d7c00cd4c46944c54116979dc7217a60e247700"],"pmid":"","title":"Relationship Queries on Extended Knowledge Graphs","journalPages":"605-614","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kberberi/publications/2016-wsdm2016.pdf","https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kberberi/presentations/2016-wsdm2016.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41536087","http://ai2-s2-pdf-tmp.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdf66.pdf","https://www2.kbs.uni-hannover.de/fileadmin/institut/pdf/webscience/2015-16/papers/p605-yahya.pdf","http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kberberi/presentations/2016-wsdm2016.pdf"],"entities":["Entity","Experiment","Knowledge Graph","Language model","Linear programming relaxation","Pareto efficiency","Population","Programming paradigm","Query language","Text corpus","Triplestore","Web search engine","YAGO"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2c6fb1a7da3853b83bd851e1c061bda249694d67","408b97932d833dce6b464c235b12096c8d47f88e","8e95526a02d6ddbadd11612baed19c78f504915b","8c39c16e9140ad7f5e1e8949714bd3dbefd7147c","3e6745542cc83797e2f8ec12f263488edc6e8f8c","45ff749bad13ec1973ec47563ba42eef970c1b21","a401596b7c337afefe0ea228ef9cd4908429b43a","042db0977555fcd7d5eac67b26695cd918ecb44c","3a197ce85e35890c15de0bca2f1b405037129829","3d2706bd886c59134f1577676b6998d601af825b","f24eefd8d53208b2eca0bf9bbe34d01004e10133","2994608bd3ed7ef582403135f21041e5ca25d9d8","593d514bf119316842185c32639e3478edcdb849","dba848de1f842d5db01369d84de47209804674eb","b3ff14e4c9b939841dec4d877256e47d12817638","0483f11717096a27648de7ee73780db3233bf306","4b2db5a1a6f5289c19ab2d10a6bc787658ff893d","b52c1b64ba302460aad5dbb2e0ba239be55f5e38","9d08cd5f8bc8905a2ff495e41bca0ac038f47f4e","33af1270e7e4e6cdfd36ea56d7149c14e68f2e68","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","38a1094dcc72cfa2599faa3558b725335d379146","7d986dac610e20441adb9161e5466c88932626e9","3d0ddaadc9e97c1cc98762bf3b477e2860511c39","5c8818b64a079070f568a9dde626c36144b1a7c4","8ad0e78a9619c50bcb3cae4a589ec9a5d38c437c","f6eb58e909dde2cf0f34e9d66330d280a73bd439","37d13cfd7fb88a4dd6cc747f45a475931c8e8931","05d4442dc06de49ae53b9dee538e1e3e690081c2","55d176b92d5740d039e1c8ebbad025d460de9ae0","112a929962c1d95883730bfa3fcc7fe856cd21ab","19a2c31570534fbdde8290413ac465b3831e9e99"],"id":"b21b4837d20749e674405ae4953cad57c893e768","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b21b4837d20749e674405ae4953cad57c893e768","authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Yahya","ids":["1795788"]},{"name":"Denilson Barbosa","ids":["1683517"]},{"name":"Klaus Berberich","ids":["1806397"]},{"name":"Qiuyue Wang","ids":["47598664"]},{"name":"Gerhard Weikum","ids":["1751591"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2835776.2835795"}

The transition from the MOOC\u2019s initial intended use as a low cost way for students to access education and aid their studies has evolved to facilitate continuing professional development (CPD), particularly within the commercial sector [1]. Findings from this study indicate there is an increase in participation and satisfaction amongst higher education staff who undertook a MOOC compared to attending traditional staff development days. Recommendations from this study\u2019s findings highlight that staff were keen to engage with the MOOC format, but felt they needed face-to-face meetings as well to reinforce, contextualize and discuss the key messages of the MOOC. In addition to this, time allocation within workloads should be considered for any future inclusion of MOOCs for staff development.","inCitations":["7f7c1b1218494c1cb95ffffc125ebe223619caca"],"pmid":"","title":"Evaluating the use of a MOOC within Higher Education Professional Development Training","journalPages":"831-833","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5266/d23bd379f47063e9f0d613103d00d516c220.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://gdac.uqam.ca/WWW2016-Proceedings/companion/p831.pdf","http://www.web-education-workshop.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WEW2016_paper_4.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2890577"],"entities":["Collaborative product development","Massive open online course","Recommender system"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["bfec04061fd1267bf291aaa5ab1414c82e8bf611","a951b3d5d72fae3156e8db51781326053af37f41","4c208310ff7e80a3eafd0f3b6a62d980fdfacb7e","8e58088b5eb9082643704a9d5d4e263efc06a799","12d2e620c89cda361398535794ada99abc440d5e"],"id":"5266d23bd379f47063e9f0d613103d00d516c220","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5266d23bd379f47063e9f0d613103d00d516c220","authors":[{"name":"Kate Mori","ids":["31214525"]},{"name":"Lucy Ractliffe","ids":["50394008"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2872518.2890577"}

We recruited participants to conduct search sessions and subsequently asked them to self-report their intentions. A total of 27 users participated in a lab study, during which they worked on two search tasks. After each search session, participants indicated their intentions during that session while viewing a video replay. Results indicate that the set of search intentions provided to participants was sufficient to account for intentions in four journalism-related information seeking tasks: a copy editing task, interview preparation task, relationships task, and story pitch task. The results also suggest regular patterns in intentions that can be exploited for identification of task type as well as potential applications to personalization and recommendation during a search episode.","inCitations":["75ebadddcecba14e6e3f57c0c78b11d4781f1d44","d57c739e73952b93b439a88e215c72637c9078d5","820a85481694e55f5baa21a24165b2ca65bcf2fd","7869b36422165fd81e5813b702bb62bf71f5e39e","96c37370d72c91bf360ce532fc4e178ab0b12383","3f767418cc5b2c024ec4368d08a240fe16226459","249e973654a3c9a3331b2bf2ea30bcec6b2a3a77"],"pmid":"","title":"Extracting Information Seeking Intentions for Web Search Sessions","journalPages":"841-844","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2911451.2914746"],"entities":["Information seeking","Personalization","Session (web analytics)","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2a1b1fe2a8ce90b33475e985e8b17568b17a3ff2","c402314407034f3670ce1db0a41d07cee0349a1e","71b47e9864ee7d31ed888a5ed6b334df3d24b689","215fa543bcaa273d41b1c412736b4fc052aabb50","930b48205b33f22d26de0e6f9e93dd49d90efb1d","f3016d731c2409818005b5ab7329f4c048eb984d","39623b1ad36d80a31677b5d0502406a97949b539","4114c881776cdbbb4fde5ab5ae8ccd3a9a1f8767"],"id":"35ec212bb31158054339fdb39484379d75765d70","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/35ec212bb31158054339fdb39484379d75765d70","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Mitsui","ids":["2881851"]},{"name":"Chirag Shah","ids":["47362550"]},{"name":"Nicholas J.

Whereas there is a large body of research on mining homogeneous graphs, this new generation of information networks are highly heterogeneous, with thousands of entity and relation types and billions of instances of those types (graph vertices and edges). In this tutorial, we present the state of the art in constructing, mining, and growing knowledge graphs. The purpose of the tutorial is to equip newcomers to this exciting field with an understanding of the basic concepts, tools and methodologies, open research challenges, as well as pointers to available datasets and relevant literature. Knowledge graphs have become an enabling resource for a plethora of new knowledge-rich applications. Consequently, the tutorial will also discuss the role of knowledge bases in empowering a range of web applications, from web search to social networks to digital assistants. A publicly available knowledge base (Freebase) will be used throughout the tutorial to exemplify the different techniques.","inCitations":["93b6329091e215b9ef007a85c07635f09e7b8adb","9940f7489584a7115675ee4e729b3e05ce2ad6cb","1664c1c7536914033ed890fd5ff01720a9e96f9d","0928ae1a420c379bfa1f3f01225606b64e9ad168"],"pmid":"","title":"Constructing and Mining Web-scale Knowledge Graphs","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":[],"entities":["Exemplification","Freebase","Genetic Heterogeneity","Graph - visual representation","Knowledge Bases","Knowledge Graph","Knowledge base","Open research","Pointer <dog>","Social network","Web application","Web search engine","YAGO"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"4d2269429201707f8ece160d9cde773977fa6216","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4d2269429201707f8ece160d9cde773977fa6216","authors":[{"name":"Evgeniy Gabrilovich","ids":["1718798"]},{"name":"Nicolas Usunier","ids":["1746841"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2911451.2914807"}
