Online personalized news recommendation is a highly challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of news features and user preferences. Although some online recommendation models have been proposed to address the dynamic nature of news recommendation, these methods have three major issues. First, they only try to model current reward (e.g., Click Through Rate). Second, very few studies consider to use user feedback other than click / no click labels (e.g., how frequent user returns) to help improve recommendation. Third, these methods tend to keep recommending similar news to users, which may cause users to get bored. Therefore, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Deep Q-Learning based recommendation framework, which can model future reward explicitly. We further consider user return pattern as a supplement to click / no click label in order to capture more user feedback information. In addition, an effective exploration strategy is incorporated to find new attractive news for users. Extensive experiments are conducted on the offline dataset and online production environment of a commercial news recommendation application and have shown the superior performance of our methods.","inCitations":["5956c34032126185d8ad19695e4a1a191c08b5a1","92df4b85574ad6007138c75b3238913dd288ad72","eae853bcfdcfd42a1c87bf5c3d142c3b459e3a4f"],"pmid":"","title":"DRN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for News Recommendation","journalPages":"167-176","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5b3d/8bc7ca76a7a82a613473aea2910342cdec40.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3185994","http://www.personal.psu.edu/~gjz5038/paper/www2018_reinforceRec/www2018_reinforceRec.pdf"],"entities":["Deployment environment","Experiment","Online and offline","Personalization","Q-learning","Reinforcement learning","User (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["02d1105bec3877ed8cd2d28f76b67ae8ba3f2331","fba0a105b03a3acaab8d0b08d873584401c0d074","4e467f4c874df9ec9f4f78840f58f9e95e3371c9","0bc6b6dd1ae154cdd49b02ae2afbb1c2934c6e7a","fedc34151dc9e7ba55f6514fd8f7b97603d0e51f","253254f518631ab21cad201f3448b48e385eff28","34b49026d61b3c308bce9ba5cf4ae8305f09d0e2","2d1cfc9e81fb159967c2be8446a8e3e7b50fe36b","f041ac53fba83674a23e0a4a3454f73b6112fe3c","a549d3b6158e737ea0d2b775b0160de5c8e77f78","2347b18b22173f4c81f39297034eed7ce6e8c724","203c80902356a0ab088da8e5154d7097b3a51cf7","f4e8a50e9a43f487b810ec89a49c642c250c8621","f03b9dbe43f8bccab2e6499e26e0be4f5bd14283","0052029755e1056c8eb85ef20c684b250849b0c3","1a932850aa9b155bffef3c52e6b51633cf2f1956","361f5c406f71d56e18450ffe0c095e9d49badfe4","035bd1607d664b0c10143ca055f1c645b7d04a11","9fa89f5f57b560b641b220e017cc8fc9c3e1984b","dd90dee12840f4e700d8146fb111dbc863a938ad","51f10257f4b21296af7141f15e93f64bd64715cd","44e9dac9ef3779a85e0f1aa56ff8060daa141dea","030f6132f6b6b3336ce9b0b29c5ac4c1e368b7dc","1634bcf53de27d2ed0e4123af8d859c2fe6f0cc9","64edd2c5c41e856695e1dcb950c0512c3a87edec","834f86f67aa0bbe1bc9b7996f79fbcab476c0851","375f771832f671ae1ca63ad4dba11fe082097fd6","32bdae2b1196664abfa5b4b8fbbe87a27e9cbcf0","3b9732bb07dc99bde5e1f9f75251c6ea5039373e","71fbbc1675780f2f945073f9d92c09b8d76f80f0","01a4a4e73c7cec89c36c7430a4ee45e1e6f7d989","544b1a65c373f405765db9814b98e54e3b45f55c","657fbf29ea0b4904a3e98d1556f9acf38dddae5f","6bf75cb71cd6c20699fe462e7bebcbea54919dee","27f43696f2ae19846744b66cd97f0f93897102e7","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701","4dc8b7b6e828f06de8155863afeac94f256936b6","0842636e2efd5a0c0f34ae88785af29612814e17","27da12128fc2da48beea1703121cd1ed0f58387a","658a81d681064e31872f49865ffaec047a5a96cc","340f48901f72278f6bf78a04ee5b01df208cc508","13b58f3108709dbbed5588759bc0496f82a261c4","96eab904ff1a00e0b5fc87c41897e748db276bba","7be38c18e604f37aed7febe65d04a022caae1f2a","5574fa91cc300eb6869ba237220d3cec83d0592e","18fb605aff0296c2bc7515fdc258a634e53a3024","7284f15812207f3741954432a05aca080c168d07"],"id":"5b3d8bc7ca76a7a82a613473aea2910342cdec40","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b3d8bc7ca76a7a82a613473aea2910342cdec40","authors":[{"name":"Guanjie Zheng","ids":["22698655"]},{"name":"Fuzheng Zhang","ids":["2642200"]},{"name":"Zihan Zheng","ids":["2011820"]},{"name":"Yang Xiang","ids":["1730821"]},{"name":"Nicholas Jing Yuan","ids":["2123146"]},{"name":"Xing Xie","ids":["49418974"]},{"name":"Zhenhui Li","ids":["1717163"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3185994"}

Several new methods have recently become available for extracting heterogeneous datasets from the genome, revealing data signals such as variations from a reference sequence, levels of expression of coding regions, or protein binding enrichments ('peaks') with their statistical or geometric properties. Huge collections of such datasets are made available by large international consortia.\n In this new context, we developed GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL), a new data extraction and integration language. GMQL supports queries over thousands of heterogeneous datasets; as such, it is key to genomic data analysis. GMQL queries are executed on the cloud, after being translated and optimized; our best deployment uses Spark over Hadoop. Datasets are described by the Genomic Data Model (GDM), which provides interoperability between many data formats; GDM combines abstractions for genomic region data with the associated experimental, biological and clinical metadata.\n GMQL is targeted to the bio-informatics community for facilitating data exploration and for integrating data extraction and data analysis; this demonstration highlights its usability and expressive power. We show GMQL at work from a Web-based user interface and from a language embedding (Python).","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Demonstration of GenoMetric Query Language","journalPages":"1887-1890","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269217"],"entities":["Apache Hadoop","Bioinformatics","British Informatics Olympiad","Communications satellite","Data model","High-throughput computing","Interoperability","Python","Query language","Software deployment","Throughput","Usability","User interface"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["35f2db34aea75c8741d5f062297d7ce03ae0e464","e651cddc82710441f625dedc5b052b4fb7adf155","29b67920953965e9e57d775bb86fcda52041f7d3","419fa0aa551131cf5e5f203a4176772c93b86ac3","0e52508812fe895c9b601b3f1cfbf1ce5ad6f23e","66ed6362c2230dbf31933e685790ffcafa79a33b","4aaafc8c561c0fde0fbbf5d5d5efdda884740a2c","b8a2eadfd542038c757c237ecbce9ba0599072fd","9f7c576d6e43366be306083dc24870533fad8406"],"id":"bb0afa03acefb5a57f0a91fb8f06ff6e5dc2bb79","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bb0afa03acefb5a57f0a91fb8f06ff6e5dc2bb79","authors":[{"name":"Stefano Ceri","ids":["1705257"]},{"name":"Arif Canakoglu","ids":["2262838"]},{"name":"Andrea Gulino","ids":["48726535"]},{"name":"Abdulrahman Kaitoua","ids":["2967853"]},{"name":"Marco Masseroli","ids":["1737880"]},{"name":"Luca Nanni","ids":["31643394"]},{"name":"Pietro Pinoli","ids":["3023769"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269217"}

In this paper we present a method to provide appliance energy usage feedback from smart meters using energy disaggregation. We put energy disaggregation in the context of a source separation and signal reconstruction problem in which we train a fully convolutional encoder decoder network to separate appliance energy usage from aggregate whole house electricity consumption data.

However, predicting mobility is not trivial because of three challenges: 1) the complex sequential transition regularities exhibited with time-dependent and highorder nature; 2) the multi-level periodicity of human mobility; and 3) the heterogeneity and sparsity of the collected trajectory data. In this paper, we propose DeepMove, an attentional recurrent network for mobility prediction from lengthy and sparse trajectories. In DeepMove, we first design a multi-modal embedding recurrent neural network to capture the complicated sequential transitions by jointly embedding the multiple factors that govern the human mobility. Then, we propose a historical attention model with two mechanisms to capture the multi-level periodicity in a principle way, which effectively utilizes the periodicity nature to augment the recurrent neural network for mobility prediction. We perform experiments on three representative real-life mobility datasets, and extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models by more than 10%. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art neural network models, DeepMove provides intuitive explanations into the prediction and sheds light on interpretable mobility prediction.","inCitations":["b332ef4922e111e6802e17868a1f7e04bbe90bba","67b609acf81b701a4f2f81da0a6ef4f6d7748585","4e8f081a113af2527274b00e444582f75834b047","7d5bdf1d03599e350e04c583b462dfffa223f599","13611197e689883bb4d870786b8c379a251a2e94","2a34e22a0f5fedb21c608b4b68f20109e53d490d"],"pmid":"","title":"DeepMove: Predicting Human Mobility with Attentional Recurrent Networks","journalPages":"1459-1468","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0e5a/5a376bb250668b0bda3413db6173dc23ae00.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186058","http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~czhang82/files/papers/www18.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Experiment","Location-based service","Modal logic","Quasiperiodicity","Real life","Recurrent neural network","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8db81373f22957d430dddcbdaebcbc559842f0d8","01a0438352146dea1129121a94fe428d97971547","7894683e9f0108245d43c3de91a3426e52e0d27f","ea4f8fe24d700327890a83f13579b60ccbc31bdd","34e9cfe143f8eb2e3c451c165ac53eec0a9a0449","06bae254319f8d39e80c7254c841787b45baf820","6a94f16627379a7163f39a5b909c41b5167d3889","4e7985c01a937562046d95f0385d6d9caf39ea6b","94a62f470aeea69af436e2dd0b54cd50eaaa4b23","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","898bcf3ca826f1e9933cf32bf99e16f862f2a6f2","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","00cbb42367566a70e3c541d93b5873565b9b1288","0ce9d60656163eabd375825b5267265f7ff3d0c9","0d7443bb67ea2d2ec9ba511a544e74425dde7fcd","7326bdd632a3f2e398d01bf72ceb69eef79ae8fd","1b1df9f75ee6f27433687dad302387f811dab64d","5fe44cc9a790e72e328f35ba7a94db572e7db114","edbb9acc7a6330db5143739b321d5dc0dd70ad73","210aa2d686edcce94fcfd57f4842a79d27c215e8","320fec1928700eaa45a820d51331da73db27850d","5bdf0970034d0bb8a218c06ba3f2ddf97d29103d","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","2f9f77ee4fa453cd114665f8b487570c0affe235","ecd143283cb3df7eb93eff26161e0febc4c49acb","163358355f85c3da8960b843606e372ded0f2cff","74e212c8d79940f43b429cc41e51e6009530524e","6988e79c4d9aa79481ec9a4a2a968438e8e62cc3","8e49f1cff559a9dee3a4effbe714478277242d78","17678f9681a496aa938531e9f97883377b168720","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","652d159bf64a70194127722d19841daa99a69b64","a0d42acae9d5d856c8f20f65f417e2c55c6547ef","d34549fed1f15caba0727d0a0678ff016a42ad10","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","404fceb167371ead0246b09bf721e7270f947973","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","503755661e0b15e4357a5bdd8e8070fc6cb2fb9f","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","1b233b82ba35c913e0ddcf19b11ec50d013a8149"],"id":"0e5a5a376bb250668b0bda3413db6173dc23ae00","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0e5a5a376bb250668b0bda3413db6173dc23ae00","authors":[{"name":"Jie Feng","ids":["1710567"]},{"name":"Yong Li","ids":["39948674"]},{"name":"Chao Zhang","ids":["1720735"]},{"name":"Funing Sun","ids":["4333086"]},{"name":"Fanchao Meng","ids":["1895395"]},{"name":"Ang Guo","ids":["8156696"]},{"name":"Depeng Jin","ids":["1717719"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186058"}

However, such models have often been based on one field of the document, for example considering document title only or document body only. Since in practice documents typically have multiple fields, and given that non-neural ranking models such as BM25F have been developed to take advantage of document structure, this paper investigates how neural models can deal with multiple document fields. We introduce a model that can consume short text fields such as document title and long text fields such as document body. It can also handle multi-instance fields with variable number of instances, for example where each document has zero or more instances of incoming anchor text. Since fields vary in coverage and quality, we introduce a masking method to handle missing field instances, as well as a field-level dropout method to avoid relying too much on any one field. As in the studies of non-neural field weighting, we find it is better for the ranker to score the whole document jointly, rather than generate a per-field score and aggregate. We find that different document fields may match different aspects of the query and therefore benefit from comparing with separate representations of the query text. The combination of techniques introduced here leads to a neural ranker that can take advantage of full document structure, including multiple instance and missing instance data, of variable length. The techniques significantly enhance the performance of the ranker, and outperform a learning to rank baseline with hand-crafted features.","inCitations":["51bf901f64239ede59f6cef4609c21a318f7d479","5091ee7158e105a7882eeb5f295d29e6cf1d77ec","5ae5971d000b2be9c4cd883ca59a2f26af07887a","5fef8601020fd0ce488bf714547fdafddd353604","c769f4a20daf6ff6ef57106a0bfef95b8890ae83","4110b96ce5cf31042c56479eeddc4bd8d07c4e93","b6ef3817f795d4f5eb45255a2e0f77e164bf6701","14a33be93ed24c5e947556f6b382135abe69fb11","22f2dae897c8df800666e42ff1869d70a5126d60","20e9e210470b94e1996cbca275217c8d2f2e0ba1"],"pmid":"","title":"Neural Ranking Models with Multiple Document Fields","journalPages":"700-708","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1290","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09174v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159730","http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09174","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09174"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8d182d01a7f75766256f08d60755026557e6d691","0aedae19e94d76520cb92932b6506389799051e2","4aba54ea82bf99ed4690d45051f1b25d8b9554b5","0b6aab9ce7910938e0d60c0764dc1c09d3219b05","01c1795d00e1ad4a69c5dd3498a38715ca898833","4736c3d6f33569e2a3fef2b6617d4b7ae782ce94","9d55aad9e11a27cb196c91672a3ffb2018c241f4","234dc7984668f72ee4917755915040386be4eb1f","eb97cff4e5b40cd2eb3494c37fa18cef165a4f11","2bdffe03bff8373445eda7e1e9439b7300a6f2fd","4e3571c4d195381518dfced7c36a78b581041737","6fef0d68a3b0cd15eb3abf6a50c630c9ca49bb8d","587d2865b0c747318539fa048265bb59c58da089","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","d2071c1e4a6030dc0005dbfeefdd196a8b293e84","45719b31a5fd6d56e12e808e8c7363ed6892a3fb","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","ea738439b880ad033ff01602ea52d04b366d0d37","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","d237072bae2bb7ab3c0e3ea10959c05df5384311","4d7880b09e9cbaba400f6bb2310c8f4582056863","364c1a3df58d87cb40ab33fdf3831cf2862f3570","67085d02e3a4710119f1bad050d89c10bd79d977","3f4667fa14aac3ae2d76a843ce1c5c664d7ef4f6","c2e18f02d85a92056dc04c4bce5f7fae95935a37","80ac6390e471b7159726bea0f0f8645f0eb6e478","3832b5bbb8d751da15cdfa466f85cfc684b16580","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2"],"id":"0f9535512a9bc8414f86a2774b5e4d8b35a5036b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0f9535512a9bc8414f86a2774b5e4d8b35a5036b","authors":[{"name":"Hamed Zamani","ids":["2499986"]},{"name":"Bhaskar Mitra","ids":["33636244"]},{"name":"Xia Song","ids":["50706785"]},{"name":"Nick Craswell","ids":["1703980"]},{"name":"Saurabh Tiwary","ids":["40070335"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159730"}

While order sampling is a powerful and efficient method for weighted sampling from a stream of uniquely keyed items, there is no current algorithm that realizes the benefits of order sampling in the context of stream aggregation over non-unique keys. A naive approach to order sample regardless of key then aggregate the results is hopelessly inefficient. In distinction, our proposed algorithm uses a single persistent random variable across the lifetime of each key in the cache, and maintains unbiased estimates of the key aggregates that can be queried at any point in the stream. The basic approach can be supplemented with a Sample and Hold pre-sampling stage with a sampling rate adaptation controlled by PBA. This approach represents a considerable reduction in computational complexity compared with the state of the art in adapting Sample and Hold to operate with a fixed cache size. Concerning statistical properties, we prove that PBA provides unbiased estimates of the true aggregates. We analyze the computational complexity of PBA and its variants, and provide a detailed evaluation of its accuracy on synthetic and trace data. Weighted relative error is reduced by 40% to 65% at sampling rates of 5% to 17%, relative to Adaptive Sample and Hold; there is also substantial improvement for rank queries.","inCitations":["daa2bbef3bf2d62aab5ec30f266982b9fb7acd4d","fb9d9132362a4bf71cc82e0833e29b24e915cbe3"],"pmid":"","title":"Stream Aggregation Through Order Sampling","journalPages":"909-918","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02693v2.pdf","http://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy562/papers/Stream%20Aggregation%20Through%20Order%20Sampling","http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02693","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02693v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133042","http://nickduffield.net/download/papers/pba-paper.pdf","http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/yu-minlan/writeup/cikm17.pdf"],"entities":["Aggregate data","Algorithm","Approximation error","CPU cache","Computational complexity theory","Downstream (software development)","Key (cryptography)","Noise (electronics)","Pre-boot authentication","Sample and hold","Sampling (signal processing)","Synthetic data","Time complexity","Unique key"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["028e534092e48aa2435884f0bdbb5d01b46c7821","5944eecf543d048b3a0359400bc49ea4f461835f","2c71fa81005dc851db928c257463340ef311d947","64e7d37666ea9f172cc63cbef84d1d123d6e95e5","7a278ee0578f194700cadc3811cdda4ec751f88a","45eb3f36b58aab6b77006e952cda1bcb6505140c","3256ea37a85284116976edb6d8b578186f76720c","1d69bf899deb04acc8dfd0ce095425bffd8beab5","080419ded5f843f4018d7dcfe2e8dd4c2880a68c","05256a303d9c6debd850da2c1c0dbab3a679ba90","3f5dc20732d3af093fec0fe2806d3c63d0652682","530ad66e2cd9a66700aab30e4bc06f91d5d3ad46","1f55cc9ae9ea3d2ebb23c4427175f01829a4105e","208d3f33e3f805cdb6fbb6a490e635b2af5f052b","7efe0dc4cde074bd87089491a6f95dde84397cca","06beeda7be321eb0a294af55b7689d22d77a5b2b","32846b66f6b7695c98484581c7fb2ea8c753525e","42b1400e01b976b8e9bfa7b772ec41338dc32ed3","50845f37d675da08c235bbdde0d3c49231e61da6","26e3eabfff42eb56bd5c397231d8aa9640e8af3c","3cb15cceb032f238d8d4b74339430f11675178e0","9062a69e547cbb61253923885fe0c7b88956780e","aef8ded2cb84e88f40b8a834b386562d87adcf67","f133c7256fc7bb34bbf72b2d8a8b861b4f6e1160","4465762fac009c8620e5d2ad67e8ffab4b7dc2f5","114bed8564dfe17089007744e8891a8d7bd47ceb","5f166a31d44ff7c3c99f7dce938d2920091650c5","02acc390a765e098d3448451d8e24d60f3972722","5d34912dcfc1aa5ced0e7658c619d622f90b5085","87ef6173ec0004dedaa6d828fdd36d002261bf07","7e7b6249b598d9a4c63394e3a2efd008268ae851","1dd2384fee50fab2361a859710889e3d0f8cb37e"],"id":"f39ea06b1e7214d2d9aa8175d38e2573c6085a64","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f39ea06b1e7214d2d9aa8175d38e2573c6085a64","authors":[{"name":"Nick G.

However, directly publishing the findings obtained from triangle counts may bring potential privacy concern, which raises great challenges and opportunities for privacy-preserving triangle counting. In this paper, we choose to use differential privacy to protect triangle counting for large scale graphs. To reduce the large sensitivity caused in large graphs, we propose a novel graph projection method that can be used to obtain an upper bound for sensitivity in different distributions. In particular, we publish the triangle counts satisfying the node-differential privacy with two kinds of histograms: the triangle count distribution and the cumulative distribution. Moreover, we extend the research on privacy preserving triangle counting to one of its applications, the local clustering coefficient. Experimental results show that the cumulative distribution can fit the real statistical information better, and our proposed mechanism has achieved better accuracy for triangle counts while maintaining the requirement of differential privacy.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Privacy-Preserving Triangle Counting in Large Graphs","journalPages":"1283-1292","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271736"],"entities":["Algorithm","Clustering coefficient","Differential privacy","Internet privacy","Social network","Taxicab geometry"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["44b2dd390f32a6a77d4e2416351df0fa08a323c1","846049313ffa7ae7613a557a15864ed3cef124f4","56c56187cdaa03372298fb6ad1dc51dba7b3499b","93010771264f02523f0b07fba660529554adc1c2","23d1255f1a0453ba96c6e6ef054903086f3656df","0eaf38cd3d7c7fb456201d59b6d28b084010d358","2983cfe2a4300707720fb133e40ae7173afdfc1d","1cf08cc1e0aafd6d783eec70add7e0875b7cd32a","0a10f3dfa73c6901aad886a7966999e6f889116a","df9594d5ef9a8f14c81453f6b9cef959e024b35d","0820c0b45928df290e4ecb4da702daf6967743d3","841847ddfe737b86ab7d7f77ea5d36e9ce058d8b","1e680495d2437649c77144ae9bfbd563ac8eed8b","4a6f84890570a4558f4679b58860505d58d729b9","1edefabf4333cfa6253b0f7ed8e7e9244b07fca7","17fac85921a6538161b30665f55991f7c7e0f940","2eb6da071a1858f4381577d41664c8715dcd60fa","24b0b57b57f0e2a5e4ac956f370f33137e5d9dda","bff1336ff2d0886a3845f2af14bf0091b1d7164a","4c97d4ab871a79c403a4f67bdaf7874eb65c6c08","1eddbbbdec587b0906013de1d377346cb7f8884b","574f9c4fbfe5ef4c5c775f73af967100ea1ea987","8a8df78ac68e701658924ba5a4a25bb3c8562f19","a92eb1836f148878557126ff6478ab4e5e03d801","94ba62fd52bddb1661f87ed7a5dc0c35c938f4d3","b60d76dcbee302d534868c7f12175b7caa9e9cb9","153dc4d5f2fbd233fec32b8e102f9a7128feed53"],"id":"ccbc8bf1802105ff8b9793a6721035d28c86dd0f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ccbc8bf1802105ff8b9793a6721035d28c86dd0f","authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Ding","ids":["50050149"]},{"name":"Xiaodong Zhang","ids":["1686594"]},{"name":"Zhifeng Bao","ids":["39505779"]},{"name":"Hai Jin","ids":["41151701"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271736"}

A key task is to find which cookies belong to the same person to recover a complete cross-device user journey. Recent work on the topic has shown the benefits of using unsupervised embeddings learned on user event sequences. In this paper, we extend this approach to a supervised se\u008aing and introduce the Siamese Cookie EmbeddingNetwork (SCEmNet), a siamese convolutional architecture that leverages the multi-modal aspect of sequences, and show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Siamese Cookie Embedding Networks for Cross-Device User Matching","journalPages":"85-86","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d44e/f1197fc8615de1814b5712296cc4621cc0a9.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10450v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3186941","http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10450"],"entities":["HTTP cookie","Modal logic","Online search","Personalization","Unsupervised learning","User journey"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3204192d28e961c358405519061422198782132a","cca0aa7340be0bb245b6e9a991ecea8d3dab066a","657fbf29ea0b4904a3e98d1556f9acf38dddae5f","36b33d88b16186d136f2258c433e7619b7c83421","b93a14feca57295a13dfc0a8da0a1a9c87b5b520","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","6c2e3a5efab69f78d9acdd9c0c8ef4b60035af73"],"id":"d44ef1197fc8615de1814b5712296cc4621cc0a9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d44ef1197fc8615de1814b5712296cc4621cc0a9","authors":[{"name":"Ugo Tanielian","ids":["40901191"]},{"name":"Anne-Marie Tousch","ids":["3137441"]},{"name":"Flavian Vasile","ids":["3358912"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3186941"}

Current navigation systems can provide the shortest route between two points, as well as scenic or safe routes. However, diversity is largely ignored in existing works. In this paper, we present a system that provides diversity-based route recommendation. It measures visual-based diversity and facility-based diversity with information extracted from publicly available data such as Google Street View images and FourSquare venues. As we will show, the current prototype system is able to provide diversity-based route recommendation for city areas in San Fransisco and Kyoto.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Walking down a Different Path: Route Recommendation based on Visual and Facility based Diversity","journalPages":"171-174","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3181/46332d4ca680f61a37c166525b766d24040a.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3186971","http://www.dl.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~adam/www18.pdf"],"entities":["Google Street View","Prototype","Recommender system","Web application"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5059cf170711bb58d0018631ecf22b8ffbfa3547","ca49e82e77cbf513a9af97b1b2f5879cc1ae3706","ee13e7ae695acb0fc13fa960fe9c25f97fec7ca7","912491a7620ee6640a636d8ea25d9ad241fcf619","039043635e9dbca769433dfe6e071992af557905","03634c4f722ea1d33dcf924e8a648fc00447c7a1"],"id":"318146332d4ca680f61a37c166525b766d24040a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/318146332d4ca680f61a37c166525b766d24040a","authors":[{"name":"Yihong Zhang","ids":["9674967"]},{"name":"Panote Siriaraya","ids":["2519656"]},{"name":"Yuanyuan Wang","ids":["49416654"]},{"name":"Shoko Wakamiya","ids":["1824142"]},{"name":"Yukiko Kawai","ids":["36113293"]},{"name":"Adam Jatowt","ids":["1774986"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3186971"}

Terrorist attacks in Europe and an incoming stream of refugees in the south of the continent are some of the reasons Europe is getting socially involved in the Middle-Eastern war. It might seem that the Netherlands could become a target of the organization too. But are Dutch citizens concerned about this? In this paper, we describe the reaction of the Dutch on ISIS by analyzing what they say on Twitter about the organization. With the use of text classification, topic modeling and visualization tools, we were able to retrieve Tweets about ISIS and create a network graph displaying the ten main topics about ISIS which Dutch people tweeted about, in addition to a word cloud, displaying the words which were most used in the Tweets. The visualizations are used to analyze what topics people discussed most regarding ISIS on Twitter and how they felt about these topics.

The text coherence problem is investigated with a new perspective of learning sentence distributional representation and text coherence modeling simultaneously. In particular, the model captures the interactions between sentences by computing the similarities of their distributional representations. Further, it can be easily trained in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is evaluated on a standard Sentence Ordering task. The experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and promise in coherence assessment showing a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.","inCitations":["b5dfc2006dde78e8f3ee9d0cd38126f0a102cfb5","a1d31ffbaad05d394ffe35bf3fd89a1c92d1fa10"],"pmid":"","title":"Text Coherence Analysis Based on Deep Neural Network","journalPages":"2027-2030","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07770v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133047","http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07770"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Convolutional neural network","DICOM","Deep learning","End-to-end principle","Interaction","Network architecture"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c0d65db8a1835497c40f25d8546122696c789ead","1025bb36b4ba6703770c98e0a6e1803520cde5a8","cad50bc232c4f1577c52cb06ebc7109892da02a6","a584211768d49f80192f13b8ed2fda9c058dec34","04d77c31c62c9afb89dac7107f4a6390bc9ee601","5f0ad315f729e2051c7c426b4afe68ddcc7512ac","89efc02bc49b425e2457b900a7d9720337961912","2006f8d01395dab714bdcdcfd1cebbe6d6276e35","ba18247cd3ce9f711eecc7296f1c3561dbfb6cc2","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","46f13e76f2b673aaad013b92c9289d93e09221c5","35ab75364b85e43cfdeefee1845b6611d34fcfe8","47a87c2cbdd928bb081974d308b3d9cf678d257e","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","481aaa51e428c7c2fe5c3b1f0d71ceace76a14b8","fae2092079a30401341abc4cf3a48c055d3106ba","44a9484e0b752e7f1218f0c6dd7461a97bc7ab49","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671"],"id":"db6e349f17ad892584c3dbcfc510253a4f0085c1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/db6e349f17ad892584c3dbcfc510253a4f0085c1","authors":[{"name":"Baiyun Cui","ids":["40064420"]},{"name":"Yingming Li","ids":["2367491"]},{"name":"Yaqing Zhang","ids":["49890431"]},{"name":"Zhongfei Zhang","ids":["1720488"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133047"}

Meanwhile, as digital corpora have grown in size, their analysis is necessarily supplemented by automated application of computational methods, which can create layers of information as intricate and complex as those within the content itself. This combination of layers - aggregating homogeneous collections, specialised analyses, and new observations - requires a flexible approach to systems implementation which enables pathways through the layers via common points of understanding, while simultaneously accommodating the emergence of previously unforeseen layers. In this paper we follow a Linked Data approach to build a layered digital library based on content from the Internet Archive Live Music Archive. Starting from the recorded audio and basic information in the Archive, we first deploy a layer of catalogue metadata which allows an initial - if imperfect - consolidation of performer, song, and venue information. A processing layer extracts audio features from the original recordings, workflow provenance, and summary feature metadata. A further analysis layer provides tools for the user to combine audio and feature data, discovered and reconciled using interlinked catalogue and feature metadata from layers below. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the system through an investigation of `key typicality' across performances. This highlights the need to incorporate robustness to inevitable `imperfections' when undertaking scholarship within the digital library, be that from mislabelling, poor quality audio, or intrinsic limitations of computational methods. We do so not with the assumption that a `perfect' version can be reached; but that a key benefit of a layered approach is to allow accurate representations of information to be discovered, combined, and investigated for informed interpretation.","inCitations":["b87d31f813b68cf25bb3842ea227ed0acfd695b1","0856904aa846b476c2942d981584db18475b79e4","6231eefcebd97d9cfd09616495efdbb00c46eaa3","e1952a692022aa7084c3e18d2f8ae029ed20b702","77214878cfe35c3fa1ce49793c8dd82b6be1cac2","8964f879465b5dd645b5d38dd7f0c7098e2eb1fc","932aa8b3e6dccb8d2a9de3cb3dbc8ae3c665e667","ee40050f1edb0307c3db56a3879eb9ee15f5f0f2","4a93e6aff9c1912f597fa047aaef580ac7c8a7ec"],"pmid":"","title":"Realising a Layered Digital Library: Exploration and Analysis of the Live Music Archive through Linked Data","journalPages":"1-10","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/31883/Fazekas%20Realising%20a%20Layered%202017%20Accepted.pdf?sequence=1","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3200345","https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/53317247/JCDL_CALMA.pdf"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["08b47077daab64f5d85a32caf89c761d7487229c","f00b672b1bf0b3c66d511768f002631e350b7bb6","5aaf311172b9778d78f6904fbe40124c63463b57","99fbcf127f98d017af59d192d6d1f5e3d7664498","30b90662e17209c9afa06e6b0ede110ff7632cc8","e76af50e96b12fc507e73b025fe9da4a99600af9","20aeb2357e9e215787c7e0d0acfe7a6b598c9103","541a5763d0512917a099f851f4615948a9ed0113","98c4c8e4c8c6a7f53c7458b4cc89904a6fabf9d2","83674b834c79a28facaf3b84810279814f27147a","55c9ac390fee7d6b7df6096dcdb2c0ba09c93c6e","4330d5fa0f2d9fd5c7c395ce4977717054b0b4ee","150cab2b18125c80f6cc8a299844f53cd6a90ed9","229185c092926c087b861d77dabbbe4db2edfaf7","0008ce9b54fcd8eb28a7cf63fc7164d74d9aa953","0e0d84d29f9c217899cd36314eedecde42c73dfa","3f4529b529483656764276112ea4bb7cb56edddd","47ca1e457f1b3f59b78a86aaec630eb0218cbd95","98c830b90997a219f1f3acf0ef894733ef0b45f7","b0f5018fa14d35fa2c10e7ce8a7a3b169c2ae4cc","033ebbc375c9d08b9a0b1cf1fa8b7475d57b82e7","5836f6f0b00053526c485c91d59cacab78d8b34f","77c8314807d2eb05c534e74c476224fa77a7ce43","2eaf38e6d55874b3263214c2533d9b55aa95fecb","9c3cfc2c07a1a7e3b456db463f527340221e9f73","32909929b0c0fdc0087e2a473e3406796d35bd39","cf422339cc7598c26b1098706988bd8ed1c34d91","233c432913a2ba04fccdcbfe6a83b9600d2a96e5","2f0d74900069e797fa189b4dfe46e5e3e8c0afd5","deef6f6302337179b76f2726c13dfc87f0ea4bba"],"id":"5a5b0872acf912b493bc6cc3fde63970ab80a5a0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5a5b0872acf912b493bc6cc3fde63970ab80a5a0","authors":[{"name":"Kevin R.

For each contract, different types of data will be consolidated from many sources and used to compute its risk tier. For high-risk tier contracts, a Quality Assurance Director (QAD) is assigned to mitigate or even prevent the risk. The QAD gathers and selects the recommended actions during regular portfolio review meetings to enable leadership to take the appropriate actions. In this paper, we propose to automatically personalize and contextualize actions to improve the efficacy.

Nowadays, cyberbullying affects more than half of young social media users worldwide, suffering from prolonged and/or coordinated digital harassment. Also, tools and technologies geared to understand and mitigate it are scarce and mostly ineffective. In this paper, we present a principled and scalable approach to detect bullying and aggressive behavior on Twitter. We propose a robust methodology for extracting text, user, and network-based attributes, studying the properties of bullies and aggressors, and what features distinguish them from regular users. We find that bullies post less, participate in fewer online communities, and are less popular than normal users. Aggressors are relatively popular and tend to include more negativity in their posts. We evaluate our methodology using a corpus of 1.6M tweets posted over 3 months, and show that machine learning classification algorithms can accurately detect users exhibiting bullying and aggressive behavior, with over 90% AUC.","inCitations":["fd3b7c475c3616124358ad58054e417aebbc79bc","fd8a4af74c3a55a3e6dd25f6099a6b20e9231d0e","295ca18d2cdb7178e01fef67130bc6e2230e8ff3","9f3051340dc1b0bcb7773f70095650491cd173b2","aa35826dba5334501e3f8b7d5af30249a118f0ae","8204359f16d999acb727d32c3117407e6acecccf","dfcd3527d11960261b9dcad668b23b7c210f3cae","1c1f20d91dcdf82710e0daf3a13df13959e61d30","8e32e8ee716688696566625a678d9c5fcf9ce9c4","913e211d44b0161f15b1d570ff4d4bb3f7708cae","09db3f98a3a1b9cb62b8f0fd205cb1ddbf2febd7","b90927a3d4879ff2794c217aba48d78d44242665","e7946fcbd40b6d3a5f9883505abb1bab159b37a6","ee619508aff0b3a2f07f3e313affabea4ccb9029","498430c7a745d593766733684f4645ea7b52b71a","cf94c28c89d01736806a97d3c591fa9fb12f26b6","beb0e2682cb0ac132dc348044d1940669fb7194a","bed74814efd2e59ef91c550b3e20e87214e70c19","853cb86dbea1ed42126db3134e7cc186395c940f","959536fe0fe4c278136777aa54d3c0032279ece3","9635a88dfbe3e6758923260a1429813f94a3e032","fca806165ab68dda751b753a3fcada929553d5ed","f3aadc407febb2b5c0d332c4e800c8c86963f794","4f8689a90b05e0eae603eb7f09bb95d5686d2269","1e791c7cd75329faa730bb299dd3ed0c12f436ea","6c8cf4c52ac677e41882aa2f26f3938c6aa063db","5040260aa3702136caaa3421dd86a964aca5cc6b","b3b097bda9834de2a7b5754ad49044dfee95ef95","f8c4e9836f54afa3f72404d900018ffd86353327","97255d2c710ed3a0be0b1c761429ced58dd7382c","7e6d508d7e9d3876311a5a399c30371c00e3548f","ff737e1d2885e5a3e5d8d8da24aa0461da128666"],"pmid":"","title":"Mean Birds: Detecting Aggression and Bullying on Twitter","journalPages":"13-22","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06877v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06877v3.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06877","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06877v2.pdf","http://oswinds.csd.auth.gr/sites/default/files/publications/ppt/websci2017presentation.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091487","https://iseclab.org/media/uploads/zotero/bullying-WEBSCI2017.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cyberbullying","Machine learning","Negativity (quantum mechanics)","Online community","Scalability","Sensor","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0088523c4bf74b35c2e7471e740d6758ab36f7b9","07f04c23147fd83e2274fe01374380a02798d60a","6c5337a1deea7a8588493f1ebfa01e00107ce037","bfcf14ae04a9a326f9263dcdd30e475334a96d39","214615f9c8d45da7c622e27a9ccac03c76035e4e","2138b37bfced70599d26dfccbf93a8e7a4b7ad85","631a35622ecb42e66d8be8cf2f3967badead9e08","0f279b97e9e318b6db58da8da66a565505a0fab6","8cf97f66243a6652d45cddb75ae6969f9b542098","1c555cc696520469ca6b14351952b194ada0bb28","37aaa2c2da2876ca5ebbfe396f942d3094d5ee30","c9948f7213167d65db79b60381d01ea71d438f94","253269723343dc8515f3f1533e9744d79209327b","649da6e910f977aab5d9e959e988d4dee526c1c9","080c47cb63f3418953115faca46e3a5531dc6487","97158169dfa967ee721c26b1a6130e46876f8e33","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","4662a354348c42a78884d1b69582cd5d550b5e9d","3166c5d28cdee481979ed84d5881ed2436fb5251","c45dc7d18f2cbe77a0433e0ab7d786a17aaff68c","4138c2fe94bd577ae9beb1f55dee016fec045707","6b17827b6e2563f10b53b8b37c95f5af5415c556","b9895c47cc273d2cd78c9f6320da937497ad0351","23dced7766f1770b5c0d65ac6eceecec05cdb593","b5d67aee50f0ea07d23b35dce0c57280b7fe5067","e39b586e561b36a3b71fa3d9ee7cb15c35d84203","812183caa91bab9c2729de916ee3789b68023f39","7accbf0de00ee952a1801e521652c41e5cef5732","a74374a36868865581539919584e4fe30e6084ee","2cc1f577bebd5c008a59913ac0c01d439f1e3772","05789d2fc1075a9fd4f33cb6a3ea14c79f47e4dc","bc37489e7173c75be152b2fcea35191c68847ab2","959536fe0fe4c278136777aa54d3c0032279ece3","2f48e9b2a2378ce3f5aaabc3976f18617decfe73","81ce545054abe91c75ee1e1f26031bf1b52b7fdb","9ddf5da8ce7f629d0869f46272b970f80990518a","fd3b7c475c3616124358ad58054e417aebbc79bc"],"id":"7b07982b0ee638ebc47e2bd41c93647bba11cb16","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7b07982b0ee638ebc47e2bd41c93647bba11cb16","authors":[{"name":"Despoina Chatzakou","ids":["2550292"]},{"name":"Nicolas Kourtellis","ids":["1946641"]},{"name":"Jeremy Blackburn","ids":["6688191"]},{"name":"Emiliano De Cristofaro","ids":["1728207"]},{"name":"Gianluca Stringhini","ids":["2350947"]},{"name":"Athena Vakali","ids":["1741423"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091487"}

The reason may be the complexity of the ranking problem, as it is not obvious how to learn from queries and documents when no supervised signal is available. Hence, in this paper, we propose to train a neural ranking model using weak supervision, where labels are obtained automatically without human annotators or any external resources (e.g., click data). To this aim, we use the output of an unsupervised ranking model, such as BM25, as a weak supervision signal. We further train a set of simple yet effective ranking models based on feed-forward neural networks. We study their effectiveness under various learning scenarios (point-wise and pair-wise models) and using different input representations (i.e., from encoding query-document pairs into dense/sparse vectors to using word embedding representation). We train our networks using tens of millions of training instances and evaluate it on two standard collections: a homogeneous news collection (Robust) and a heterogeneous large-scale web collection (ClueWeb). Our experiments indicate that employing proper objective functions and letting the networks to learn the input representation based on weakly supervised data leads to impressive performance, with over 13% and 35% MAP improvements over the BM25 model on the Robust and the ClueWeb collections. Our findings also suggest that supervised neural ranking models can greatly benefit from pre-training on large amounts of weakly labeled data that can be easily obtained from unsupervised IR models.","inCitations":["e301275b5924494b43bff0f931baa324fddc1a0c","f53d7c0b8a44a4d179a005ce98500456d53d1d63","14a33be93ed24c5e947556f6b382135abe69fb11","953ff89b61382263091ee78304577d145200a1ae","cce7c272dbc3249a45f18b43d8c79664033d12ad","98472179ed79d8d67362e61b4582d686755c9d3b","5f8d47c65be2b58be5e9cb6b0383a38941a84a63","22f2dae897c8df800666e42ff1869d70a5126d60","575c8cbf97b0b5fb99cb359570f2ecb438b77036","fc3384d631f5e2b2a9d66623d4d3e1d28b96dee7","10cdb2f8943e2589673818e7f4d630464de94553","613cd84894ee61e51bca03a1e4feae8624617399","caa8b954566c9a97db0267b281d8a9843ecfac3d","9b9ddb87a7a3522dcd74ede538b0c1dd0db6024e","a9df59fbbed634b8473f133ce11856fa6ce03868","43642a638cae87af650f9acf65eb75d6b1f4a733","4323a97845917859c5d56d318ddc33da6ceacaa1","06e7ba45e4def91c280360791031f2b24d9898e5","76f449e391ba7fe2428ca563dbd2a1f0cdb54710","e9595c4c99c0aa1fbd092d19813d984f39823494","3e37b7d4b60334ba083f60d69a73a8c251458d03","0bd0ba5ec0d8e4a9c86725a8920842151c616a35","f9954113e8b701df4ba38f6d0da6656e52466bbf","ec90406cefe54a6488616ebf5bf0bc7363956497","8549510a69fec4f723250d195f02af66b6b2bccd","ee0185185838103059157f91c5e1f8b7d45c0b5e","1aae280c85f0eb40c7a82525dfe7798f27ce0a2c","f0d116b7d8dc6542a0b1331cbd747573f32a6a2b","432b36c1bec275c2778c66f9897f9e02f7d8b579","cda4897c7a2a5f4fdf0a8d12f2032a723cbb8302","de411ccc884f55a8527db7dbd232955a2826d397","d9a633d57312f59393fcf98e1f5f25b3b5cbf904","fb993659d2aa8cbaef429d1d6333c95310920d31","0939cd4462d294946435e5503c591ca33adf4f9b","20e9e210470b94e1996cbca275217c8d2f2e0ba1","0f9535512a9bc8414f86a2774b5e4d8b35a5036b","d2d7f9f2029ab66165dfe2f083b2160f2443eaae","fab5828ac72c3cf10b55b5819296a65baa4aca32","41a31fb17a9b1c5ee267dea43ee7e682bc07dae8","d778697179299798419a6f6ea498ef46932c0854","7f01c6fe27f57ee6191b51efa18b9199baf7b82a","6f8fc12004fa068c424369793fd39426e772b07d","d8191c96a89bb843b5e422583246ec6464cad27a","da036a105189563b2f6e8f559a774e301d4dc2c5","f4b635da887e963b9caa05d4978a23866638796a","0b33a3653f4b645be831ab3387137151acf0b211","33fd02f1485c562449650f8edbe5aac892476dca","f4b96cbeff598f6655ec16bfc754b92fa416df21","ad5d07e542a773820128c4da08ca4be18133cb92","8d182d01a7f75766256f08d60755026557e6d691","3f26b7932ff73610e1fc2c5def42cf873a0e096b","581082bf235f70ea070201839d7b8223a0cbf321","d036bcd996da56d2fa41e43c77e09b313fd25cfe","033600ee58fca630f07a7647ebdfde0d8b2bd7cb","51bf901f64239ede59f6cef4609c21a318f7d479","c94cd6f5433c27eb1f944bab0960e813fa2c25cf","e01afd8b7c12894fbe0d48fd87045d9b2ad4c5e3","c769f4a20daf6ff6ef57106a0bfef95b8890ae83","2b6c68e0cb1a6a6e4092cc335cc0110d3583e035","b286e2164f51daf7e39613583c79c3e45cd422ae","b22e36568321a27ca8a2a09e9a6a3fa6cb89507e","ebfcfc4d7183f912e23e52fecd7c72449da7c302","0a1d7d955fe01206c71e393444c1a9b4cea09c0d","a72de9c34a71fcd7d3d0fa3cdf71cb9efbba7c73","b6ef3817f795d4f5eb45255a2e0f77e164bf6701","e643b04503d341432dccff0f567055c778fb1bb6","22b56535aa94b133038aa9be05aa0e3af5037003","256a1b72030066dea0682abab25b156758a53e27","9d5cf3567ffc462083df263873c176341b3ceea8","b2ba41f05f40df30281c5041f439dc36387e56e8"],"pmid":"","title":"Neural

Perceived virtual relationships, commonly known as para-social relationships (PSR) have been shown to exist between celebrities and fans (Horton and Wohl, 1956). The end of such relationships, para-social breakups (PSB), have also been studied (Eyal and Cohen, 2006). However, with more and more celebrities using social media, the dynamics of PSR and PSB have changed. Using data from 57,000 fans for the top followed celebrities on Twitter, we try to understand how para-social breakups manifest on Twitter. We hypothesize that a PSB on Twitter happens as an act of unfollowing the celebrity and study the differences in engaging in a PSB between various types of fans. We find that, surprisingly, the most devoted fans are more likely to be involved in a para-social breakup. Given our scale and dependence on non-reactive data, our paper opens new avenues for research in para-social interactions.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Understanding Para Social Breakups on Twitter","journalPages":"383-384","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://ingmarweber.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Understanding_Para_Social_Breakups_on_Twitter.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3098877"],"entities":["Interaction","Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing","Real life","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d3a1ba93ebda182e9e448bc833c44faee3022c2e","4f97475aca3638164d440d6d63593232c8ab74f4","08bf1763d34c8712dceb9d7cf837a3612779b3c8"],"id":"acd4ef66af3230fcf013e19c33e68ac6221f4e2f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/acd4ef66af3230fcf013e19c33e68ac6221f4e2f","authors":[{"name":"Venkata Rama Kiran Garimella","ids":["1699369"]},{"name":"Jonathan Cohen","ids":["50065230"]},{"name":"Ingmar Weber","ids":["1684687"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3098877"}

For value maximizers, GSP is the truthful auction [4]. Moreover, this implies an axiomatization of GSP \u2014 it is an auction whose prices are truthful for value maximizers \u2014 that can be applied much more broadly than the simple model for which GSP was originally designed. In particular, applying it to arbitrary single-parameter domains recovers the folklore definition of GSP. Through the lens of value maximization, GSP metamorphosizes into a powerful auction, sound in its principles and elegant in its simplicity.","inCitations":["f57a2ad8bf221f721fe58814ea95c1b35f753572","e760ba21d701b88fee7c47ff4ab8bcafb6d288fc","5bb5fc4cc50d2800ff16b84e7ef72be40601ce54","3c455755220cd93a61d4d81971b0ee374de4f580","eb0d684f514e9dd03660f3db046a6e8a8ba94e7e"],"pmid":"","title":"GSP: The Cinderella of Mechanism Design","journalPages":"25-32","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7bd8/a9c4656084b94ac36b0336df8d46c3401c6b.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p25.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05946v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05946","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rad/WCN'17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052687"],"entities":["Auction algorithm","Axiomatic system","Coincidence point","Edmund M.

Being able to predict this value directly benefits the recommendation and ad pacing contexts in music and video streaming services. Recent research has shown that predicting the exact amount of time spent is highly nontrivial due to many external factors for which a user can end a session, and the lack of predictive covariates. Most of the other related literature on duration based user engagement has focused on dwell time for websites, for search and display ads, mainly for post-click satisfaction prediction or ad ranking. In this work we present a novel framework inspired by hierarchical Bayesian modeling to predict, at the moment of login, the amount of time a user will spend in the streaming service. The time spent by a user on a platform depends upon user-specific latent variables which are learned via hierarchical shrinkage. Our framework enjoys theoretical guarantees and naturally incorporates flexible parametric/nonparametric models on the covariates, including models robust to outliers. Our proposal is found to outperform state-of-the-art estimators in terms of efficiency and predictive performance on real world public and private datasets.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Hierarchical Modeling and Shrinkage for User Session LengthPrediction in Media Streaming","journalPages":"607-616","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271700","http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01440","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01440v2.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Bayesian network","Cobham's thesis","Convex optimization","Interrupt","Latent variable","Login","Loss function","Mathematical optimization","Online and offline","Real life","Streaming media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2c0cdd08a8d3cb834da33515037eafa4bdb5faff","26bc9195c6343e4d7f434dd65b4ad67efe2be27a","f6787e7c82272ce56fbb6771b13b2bab8f110867","1b65af0b2847cf6edb1461eda659f08be27bc76d","8bdcde37ae42ff7eb54529d6a012428773b113ba","44c990cdec924eedbea7d21e39452cb6b0e4f3bd","c4806efffa95a727006d2d6284240f2c181f75ab","40d41c8c94e71d76ad84bc2a7154800cb2693fdd","5c431acc0a3f56660e9275248a3b549feb79c06f","33b3d9864a0f776afdc2d57453a4acc0a9f2519e","bdfb35517be890b6b071c580d5d56d4f542d2b29","3957eedd032ba9dee0b40ab90c861b55f91e89a4","bcf48b5e76c7e22335c6820f0de0abe8c5f708b5","ab21e24201e6117ee6879a58624b655a52e9dd54","18fb605aff0296c2bc7515fdc258a634e53a3024","4b9e993d7f4846d4750762fc0dba5b0ddadd709b","a68cb0d4b8fc2b71327feab589c93e321383e047"],"id":"ffdaea586497a465867be836a828452e69d5a5e6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ffdaea586497a465867be836a828452e69d5a5e6","authors":[{"name":"Antoine Dedieu","ids":["36361397"]},{"name":"Rahul Mazumder","ids":["3523738"]},{"name":"Zhen Zhu","ids":["48148046"]},{"name":"Hossein Vahabi","ids":["2507979"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271700"}

While traditional EL approaches have largely focused on English texts, current trends are towards language-agnostic or otherwise multilingual approaches that can perform EL over texts in many languages. One of the obstacles to ongoing research on multilingual EL is a scarcity of annotated datasets with the same text in different languages. In this work we thus propose VoxEL: a manually-annotated gold standard for multilingual EL featuring the same text expressed in five European languages. We first motivate and describe the VoxEL dataset, using it to compare the behaviour of state of the art EL (multilingual) systems for five different languages, contrasting these results with those obtained using machine translation to English. Overall, our results identify how five state-of-the-art multilingual EL systems compare for various languages, how the results of different languages compare, and further suggest that machine translation of input text to English is now a competitive alternative to dedicated multilingual EL configurations.","inCitations":["cf24586ab114c132f69accfd9754210b8085031e","7e5bc66023e2aac94f3f41848a58195904142bc4"],"pmid":"","title":"VoxEL: A Benchmark Dataset for Multilingual Entity Linking","journalPages":"170-186","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/03a9/265c82e4b80247f07bb1eedb3b6a33682ef2.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.aidanhogan.com/docs/voxel_multilingual_entity_linking.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00668-6_11","http://www.dit.unitn.it/~pavel/OM/articles/Rosales-Mendez_iswc18.pdf"],"entities":["Babelfy","Benchmark (computing)","DBpedia","Entity linking","Experiment","Knowledge base","Language-independent specification","Machine translation","Neuroscience Information Framework","One-to-one (data model)","Text corpus","Voxel","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2d0d34637db18461643a3b1aa4d51d2ddb30b2bc","9ca61f6ede25100da67b5388c941bf69929a7528","d7403f9f0a5e22f69b5bfda3a29b4f032cad842c","128d2482c0968cbd7639ecbe7dca97c11cf51570","c407ff39024ee63d56bb09d43117dd438e443825","9ce5fe90794acb5dcc36b2e90b38fc33e9ef6637","6a52c1447b96a73a68d14069ee0e9f04de216551","0b9dea9414a3acbd5d00e00541f917f96be68e19","4ca528d8e582d7927727e272dc651677286ad915","7769af2a451d1e13582c0e3af028cef4ba0a3350","6c83b6afa58aa69ffb2c8a408f8ac392dcc0f760","e8177476a3c62278d3b5dd3a99b9bb417c7d449a","1d2a4018b4fc6a5f498e65d68260615dbc9e7ec6","fe2b08135fbfe3d3a8846f5b328afb8a0ab1567d","526db07760eca0a0b7a3b01e43368a4a9a229b60","5b35981142209ad7d003ec4341b64f9a04005e10","6016495c5a5d4040773395350a49150ada14e1c1","743f3041effeabfbae3e8e179bf993386f2876a9","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","ff0e6684aff7ab0476c5b34bb9fc274124327f5a","12f7b71324ee8e1796a9ef07af05b66674fe6af0","ae93607a4c49c49bc684ba4cafb182fc4268b2e3","4fa0d9c4c3d17458085ee255b7a4b7c325d59e32","0ab8627660919f08a89fe05655e98ee63a318e8d","8d909921d6cd819dce68673f0ae9997122423812","4d337fdffca3daf6ab8eb8b1b469e48730c6c6f5","837b071d4c83e0f90d3e6b6edc1a2d4ca35711fb","7aab8952e711c0858cbc98faf4eafffebccc1bb5","d39ed7762394c6c6aa25a6ecf048662188e2ebdd","425d6a85bc0b81c6e288480f5c6f5dddba0f1089","196d7e0a43587b0216c47a1ddb8cb1875aa1c1d0","3a7210732592a60ee1ec9ab259c77b5bb4197142","aa2a7ac7bfa9a0201d4faddd4e7bb26299a5e0be","dc463b4950cb00e5fba3822924edda1d0b6d07ec","ad40e2f53f7112f4d2177df99fe5df47e2028541","1c909ac1c331c0c246a88da047cbdcca9ec9b7e7"],"id":"80bbf722f655c3176973909f15bd4dd0c037e9ac","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/80bbf722f655c3176973909f15bd4dd0c037e9ac","authors":[{"name":"Henry Rosales-Méndez","ids":["3075194"]},{"name":"Aidan Hogan","ids":["2473381"]},{"name":"Barbara Poblete","ids":["2272762"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00668-6_11"}

This is also called real-time bidding (RTB) and the ad displaying process ensures that the publisher's benefit is maximized or there is an equilibrium in ad auctions. However, the benefits of the other two stakeholders - the advertiser and the user - have been rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational framework that selects a banner ad based on the optimized trade-offs among all stakeholders. The first stage is still auction based and the second stage re-ranks ads by considering the benefits of all stakeholders. Our metric variables are: the publisher's revenue, the advertiser's utility, the ad memorability, the ad click-through rate (CTR), the contextual relevance, and the visual saliency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that optimizes trade-offs among all stakeholders in RTB by incorporating multimedia metrics. An algorithm is also proposed to determine the optimal weights of the metric variables. We use both ad auction datasets and multimedia datasets to validate the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the publisher can significantly improve the other stakeholders' benefits by slightly reducing her revenue in the short-term. In the long run, advertisers and users will be more engaged, the increased demand of advertising and the increased supply of page views can then boost the publisher's revenue.","inCitations":["4155365ea340f5d2939c6f32c1385e6246c28919"],"pmid":"","title":"Optimizing Trade-offs Among Stakeholders in Real-Time Bidding by Incorporating Multimedia Metrics","journalPages":"205-214","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10642","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3077136.3080802","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/159032/1/159032.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10642v3.pdf"],"entities":["Auction algorithm","Display advertising","Feasible region","Mathematical optimization","Optimizing compiler","Page view","Real-time bidding","Real-time clock","Relevance","Web banner","Web page"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["876bfee8b66b8940d6ca43f1f448f8f82d606807","1b4523aa07fc0dab565a45c55009de963053942c","ae7d5d50fc1d11aff59f910c3b37d7ee6415ee51","0862546afcd8cd40af6e149eda82e832d2b9868d","8af63cd129217c2264845f4d71180e4a8ab0d754","8c087fe26314a8f9327fb9382e2e6aa7d99f9bda","2ef4ec21347c457dcedef334d7a54e5cb0545ca9","6fb5142dc60256ad0cea7051be23fb94eb27ccc0","59e8a0371a8cdaf24cdc3e3c0f5e7e6f2d6a1251","2286315e1787519c14617a85fe633b8080b30ea9","26346f47a1d2b74216de9b64e544e4f195d408a6","5ccf2ede4bb17bac118a6bb47a0583f3c55e68d2","2ed346d7bc09b6151f6a2b1910a6817c822d72db","270536a38fe2e901e676eafc914235979c3a6462","2834899017d814886679f378858ba52d34ee6ddd","53993c7fabf631cbd8a44ab3e42c6bdf784db456","4f92339b2624fae5b4dfbaa85cad326f380af83a","2cd6252dbe666b7c17957e396f31df5c766c426a","1a2931a234e41034f78321dba216828eb8feddff","d3972d4285c48ec17f4bb59fbf412acef5233291","970628d3fcbae58a787c5a50523e93ecf8d212e7","6d55be7a6fcbf760f9c32548afddb313606598c8","8fbe262bf0e83766f6985e25e2af851ea5cec66b","81e8916b9d4eeb47c2e96c823b36d032b244842f","bfc214ce7ab5b101425e5cabd631176bb427adff","4e937d0372eb356ab64b47c6e140ad1dc729a0d6","1cea62d9d9436fe78ed83676a7102a46a7f5446b","2092f0f1adaee50ed247216a1cfab7016add37f5","89b2facea4c73aea089d37b0782d7e9156145be5","0df68ccc83e7b879282c4a89100661fb2194a207","1134280b51cb3a24be47ee98be9044414f74b718","b705f7267fc9a2b51fbe124328d8985dabe85c04"],"id":"3f34fe30f4ddb69bf7f886fa78dcf7bcd4d930bd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3f34fe30f4ddb69bf7f886fa78dcf7bcd4d930bd","authors":[{"name":"Xiang Chen","ids":["46772865"]},{"name":"Bowei Chen","ids":["47440000"]},{"name":"Mohan S.

The conceptualization and contextualization of various entities and dimensions have emerged with innovation that led us to develop a digital ecosystem-based inventory. The ODP based domain ontologies support the warehouse repository, which accommodates multidimensional data relationships. The concept of a digital ecosystem in the ODP context is to bring the dimensions together and unite with multidimensional schemas. We explore the Big Data, incorporating their characteristics in the ODP constructs and models. The volumes and varieties of the ODP data are logically organized and integrated in the warehouse repositories. The multidimensional data modelling makes the ODP more smart and flexible in an environment, where varieties of business rules and constraints change rapidly. The visualization and interpretation are the other artefacts of the Big Data facilitating us use, reuse, test the interoperability and effectiveness of the data models for sustainable ODP digital ecosystem. We compute the polynomial regressions, based on the data fluctuations of the ODP as observed in the scatter plots, providing new data mining models for knowledge interpretation.","inCitations":["357795872c69cca7f7a42e47048acdcdb76536b6"],"pmid":"","title":"Knowledge Base Smarter Articulations for the Open Directory Project in a Sustainable Digital Ecosystem","journalPages":"1537-1545","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0673/c323ea05956ff2cbad8a32dd2ba07999d97d.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1537.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054769"],"entities":["Apple Open Directory","Big data","Conceptualization (information science)","Data mining","Data model","Data modeling","Digital ecosystem","Entity","Interoperability","Knowledge base","Logical topology","Ontology (information science)","Polynomial","RM-ODP"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["76a30c37a0ea6c62a8494612ddcef7cc28da9d11","2499da7d503078a604418030d3fcc12e1b2458c4","d527b324501f6f5a3be47a1226cea13a5f2d85b6","8838db5d2c1755c400db161c3064d30c89995cbc","8fd0fd4173339b29d1790aba3bba280a787389bd","40027b88123002e0c01a54639f2abeb5e64cb7f4","2b249e02cc4c4defe809667cc794a62adafa5b20","877854f9b25288935522b78e2753235537c2f976","075f3db938d03e8ae033e1b6a20f1fcae43d7302","cb846a2bc8d78d55ae8ad36dfd662408273cad49","108f8bad22a541aa53f0c6aff8a4c061f3d4d465","d978cc1624aa8620ceafd2b2a9121c255e032652","f2fd093d6d6b24af08c2e2788d07bd1b3d238bf4","6451546c986519489608d57b0eeef765590bf603","c32b38c793bc0d9237c05b92ce6873847adf42ac","1229c34adfc702a725f8e831d444794beaa3c034"],"id":"0673c323ea05956ff2cbad8a32dd2ba07999d97d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0673c323ea05956ff2cbad8a32dd2ba07999d97d","authors":[{"name":"Shastri L.

One of the emerging applications of HAR is to monitor needy people such as elders, patients of disabled, or undergoing physical rehabilitation, using sensing technology. In this paper, an improved version of Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) is proposed which makes use of misclassified results for post-learning. Specifically, a new technique namely Misclassified Recall (MR) which is a postprocessing step for relearning a new concept, is formulated. In HAR, most misclassified instances are those belonging to ambiguous movements. For examples, squatting involves actions in between standing and sitting, falling straight down is a sequence of standing, possibly body tiling or curling, bending legs, squatting and crashing down on the floor; and there may be totally new (unseen) actions beyond the training instances when it comes to classifying \u201cabnormal\u201d human behaviours. Think about the extreme postures of how a person collapses and free falling from height. Experiments using wearable sensing data for multiclass HAR is used, to test the efficacy of the new methodology VFDT+MR, in comparison to a classical data stream mining algorithm VFDT alone.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"On Recognizing Abnormal Human Behaviours by Data Stream Mining with Misclassified Recalls","journalPages":"1129-1135","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/efce/c4daeafc0fe72ab8605750b8428801bfc0e6.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1129.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054929"],"entities":["Activity recognition","Algorithm","Archive","Cluster analysis","Confusion matrix","Data stream mining","Decision tree","Elegant degradation","Holism","Multiclass classification","Precision and recall","Scalability","Sensor","Simulation","Tiling window manager","Video post-processing","Wearable computer"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3556c846890dc0dbf6cd15ebdcd8932f1fdef6a2","2b64d787a2cdfabcd10bad495d15e1407addc80b","9953decd812a578df999bff85aba622a31f07111","c67eeed921768d002684900f8f52fb0fb10835db","0bf6d1208d6df29423692060def8cdfd8ff7a5cf","18b02beb27288f6bd9d4376ca41e70655a698084","8ca327ee1295a9f799dbe67bb9d65eeebbae77d8","8f8ad072421b36b3689b2219a0a49c2f6575ef7d","de2174bae4358f05cd9f0eaaad086c5262c7536d","e4338af0ee599c29515b40c67a2777499aa0021b","a9b35080d736b9e5cdc6230512809123b383e671","3af17bdd6775f5aa1738fe6c103968e640cf4e21","6678b407e30d3ff28050b5789ad55439735a9ac2","06fdfa00ea6a51aafa8fe305d2d69f4b46973892","418fd4e93086f4476eff13b4b42d989bec22b8b3","773fcbb1d7de5cb5aacd911ce7551746f83b21af","6cb3895e439cc4d4ae32b270d51e3fd150250906","ade370e2ce0e8847ffe9d72389cd9a3c42842b95","ec71bc20442cb839f1a01417fe11446a8a4f61a8"],"id":"efcec4daeafc0fe72ab8605750b8428801bfc0e6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/efcec4daeafc0fe72ab8605750b8428801bfc0e6","authors":[{"name":"Simon Fong","ids":["1721970"]},{"name":"Shimin Hu","ids":["48802339"]},{"name":"Wei Song","ids":["40162927"]},{"name":"Kyungeun Cho","ids":["2818294"]},{"name":"Raymond K.

Obviously, any true source of text reuse that is not retrieved during the source retrieval step reduces the overall recall of a reuse detector. Hence, source retrieval is a recall-oriented task, a fact ignored even by experts: Only 3 of 20 teams participating in a respective task at PAN 2012-2016 managed to find more than half of the sources, the best one achieving a recall of only~0.59.

We study the problem of natural language interface to APIs (NL2APIs), with a focus on web APIs for web services. Such NL2APIs have many potential benefits, for example, facilitating the integration of web services into virtual assistants.\n We propose the first end-to-end framework to build an NL2API for a given web API. A key challenge is to collect training data, i.e., NL command-API call pairs, from which an NL2API can learn the semantic mapping from ambiguous, informal NL commands to formal API calls. We propose a novel approach to collect training data for NL2API via crowdsourcing, where crowd workers are employed to generate diversified NL commands. We optimize the crowdsourcing process to further reduce the cost. More specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical probabilistic model for the crowdsourcing process, which guides us to allocate budget to those API calls that have a high value for training NL2APIs. We apply our framework to real-world APIs, and show that it can collect high-quality training data at a low cost, and build NL2APIs with good performance from scratch. We also show that our modeling of the crowdsourcing process can improve its effectiveness, such that the training data collected via our approach leads to better performance of NL2APIs than a strong baseline.","inCitations":["0ba2b86242e0d04cdf4e88aa5a544357e459288d","206335225e093551e97b297110225b0a6701f13f","3ea850ab5761fe7cb1e3c9c2599e1e5cd2fb2112","dc030c2e55b266c029356a54bb444b7d9b1f2abc","e8475cfc1f72f0c0e4df1556566eb719b27e83cf","8761fe4a7dbdc9fb214b7e25096053507aeb9b69"],"pmid":"","title":"Building Natural Language Interfaces to Web APIs","journalPages":"177-186","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133009","http://cs.ucsb.edu/~ysu/papers/cikm17_nl2api.pdf"],"entities":["Application programming interface","Baseline (configuration management)","Crowdsourcing","Dialog system","End-to-end principle","Language model","Mathematical optimization","NL (complexity)","Natural language user interface","Semantic mapper","Service-oriented architecture","Service-oriented device architecture","Spoken dialog systems","Statistical model","Web API","Web service"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0ed8e3871e427b33dcfb98974af0c76996134004","1b3fe379e9f321c1dfe8a802d73f1a094298f630","24ff26b9cf71d9f9a8e7dedf0cfe56d105363cd3","7a4d676d8e037321db1effaae1f1f88a3f9be07e","47c27cd2c37ba331ced0b24fba43fd917d5f6d19","b0dd99ca21a8eb04f4133cb4c2d057be037a8e32","0d98bb00dfe73bc21bbe906cb3a77764c9138b47","047a000fdd280d1953d230d162374971a32cd6b8","042db0977555fcd7d5eac67b26695cd918ecb44c","112b1448c7b309711bb8a85e282645a704a57f8f","41866f1c6e5b92d1f73749c5de1394447aa72fc5","2518ece8eeb2fecc3ed0f69adaba98ff83c026e7","0e27493639268ecd35356e5e08d45e5d0dcd7fd8","41ab97376fcbd67d05bad648b40d92d96a3f1c1c","837f29be38a14d61caf2c10248ef8d5ef48b468f","6e565308c8081e807709cb4a917443b737e6cdb4","25369f56a933e3bfb1d8e1588cdc6c50df93ecae","55f5e98bd4a32fcb5e597052f15efbea78b02fb0","1d7db886d2af3734634450d134de344f5cf3e742","1d7d7362c1e4b1544fd4ce2af7c65f9f47ffeb82","097665e66a05d316ad0e649fec374db44a485bda","673a851db00c835d17788b8a6cb7b470de493fb8","0286d2f03b29fee6381d5546a6f51df2a2cde379","745c2b01a77e63ad5835db50a0420ce4be6e1d81","0567eeecaadaf19c408a8fb5e941786e36b199ef","40d25c148b7ae32fdf1f33a9a3d7627319ce4f5c","b53686ae41b6fd5ec2ec80a8275f9bd9aac2b41a","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","0041273d39fa57ffefaba21b0a4e491b0d017b79","46a08cb624b2f7be26c1cf69ebd89446f4034ed3","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","818826f356444f3daa3447755bf63f171f39ec47"],"id":"585bf9bf946b4cd4571b2fe6f73f5a7ba9a3d601","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/585bf9bf946b4cd4571b2fe6f73f5a7ba9a3d601","authors":[{"name":"Yu Su","ids":["50087337"]},{"name":"Ahmed Hassan Awadallah","ids":["1977489"]},{"name":"Madian Khabsa","ids":["2072010"]},{"name":"Patrick Pantel","ids":["1990190"]},{"name":"Michael Gamon","ids":["2417334"]},{"name":"Mark J.

However, there is little to aid them in sorting through the overwhelming load of information that is offered. In this paper, we propose a new research problem: suggesting example sentences for learning word distinctions. We focus on near-synonyms as the first step. Two kinds of one-class classifiers, the GMM and BiLSTM models, are used to solve fill-in-the-blank (FITB) questions and further to select example sentences which best differentiate groups of near-synonyms. Experiments are conducted on both an open benchmark and a private dataset for the FITB task. Experiments show that the proposed approach yields an accuracy of 73.05% and 83.59% respectively, comparable to state-of-the-art multi-class classifiers. Learner study further shows the results of the example sentence suggestion by the learning effectiveness and demonstrates the proposed model indeed is more effective in learning near-synonyms compared to the resource-based models.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Towards a Better Learning of Near-Synonyms: Automatically Suggesting Example Sentences via Fill in the Blank","journalPages":"293-302","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55a7/d4cc75d592639389e70240ea7d2307a15785.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054163","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p293.pdf"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Google Map Maker","Sorting","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["439cc68dec42870cbdc4103855f69d380e0f9a44","981fec6d9d4b45c2f0f4d80512fe0cf56419b8b1","66d60e9ba3e27f8fda2c9246cc723cada62ba3d6","1462b56f662fd50d199b0e862c576bfc4075fe43","9ac8ba7b5d78c8a8764a3064e59a0017b440991d","3a39206799e8ad69b3038f22ba7aa48722c1ecc0","2f83f6e1afadf0963153974968af6b8342775d82","178631e0f0e624b1607c7a7a2507ed30d4e83a42","6208ee83919ca4bbb1dba223b1d8102be0021a99","9e4291de6cdce8e6f247effa308d72e2ec3f6122","d6bb4f3b28e97c20d8c58af5cd9751fe1ef905d9","cda843371fe0fdd6722dca31afeb882ef61a9e2f","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","566fd527c8be61b461cb7c437843972a1df2b727","cda680a98310e3a4fd567b0d4d7a7cf0f85fd5df","5c43dda16a3ba339d97fae1023305c80b45e6d04","77f9c326235404f404e2e7cbb6a55aedd115c87b","d7a8e7aee25703f2b0e1b9cc94d7f65801abd4b2","4b8089bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2","f6c035de37e797f7e5167d655b246a2f9426a9eb","55fb5e0493314d0b9f3834d8826f58300bb16e7a","3ac6048987af33cbccb0b5d3419df6092b09f6d2","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","4305fbcf887a24442373eb0a223a6f988e58b123","72fd771553ef87b3a03d9fe9b17decbb9a6a4883"],"id":"55a7d4cc75d592639389e70240ea7d2307a15785","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/55a7d4cc75d592639389e70240ea7d2307a15785","authors":[{"name":"Chieh-Yang Huang","ids":["7901504"]},{"name":"Mei-Hua Chen","ids":["40617421"]},{"name":"Lun-Wei Ku","ids":["1746959"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054163"}

Such diverse relevance patterns require an ideal retrieval model to be able to assess relevance in the right granularity adaptively. Unfortunately, most existing retrieval models compute relevance at a single granularity, either document-wide or passage-level, or use fixed combination strategy, restricting their ability in capturing diverse relevance patterns. In this work, we propose a data-driven method to allow relevance signals at different granularities to compete with each other for final relevance assessment. Specifically, we propose a HIerarchical Neural maTching model (HiNT) which consists of two stacked components, namely local matching layer and global decision layer. The local matching layer focuses on producing a set of local relevance signals by modeling the semantic matching between a query and each passage of a document. The global decision layer accumulates local signals into different granularities and allows them to compete with each other to decide the final relevance score.Experimental results demonstrate that our HiNT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art retrieval models significantly on benchmark ad-hoc retrieval datasets.","inCitations":["e9f7ca5d4cf9b9aca2706ae67dc3de58d7ebf498","5091ee7158e105a7882eeb5f295d29e6cf1d77ec"],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling Diverse Relevance Patterns in Ad-hoc Retrieval","journalPages":"375-384","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05737v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05737","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209980"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Benchmark (computing)","Deep learning","Hoc (programming language)","Information retrieval","Learning to rank","PageRank","Relevance","Semantic matching"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a75e912a1712776f33239bef3c432c669f442a62","4adb97f155fa9ab8a1d3128db4b00a7812349e5b","57c682ac421e67fa3697c75f1b2a2e7b6bd6c292","305ea2c0992052c4c9574cf1873a855fbb88b957","9f00cae22a1f1f7d3d3cdd63e87bd0abf5e1240a","3257cfb4bb041efe583a3c80e4491419d8852275","234dc7984668f72ee4917755915040386be4eb1f","0dcdc50ffd9f68e1d0f2878552329920022cfe99","0496b636c5304ccd37321b5e04c13aadb9a5fbc0","aad41c3828185b8d3e89b73867476b63ad0b9383","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","23c6f2ec6d65eb00db0ce677904a5fc07e4b6db1","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","38f58c1e201b7c770464f065a593e597a54d545c","80ac6390e471b7159726bea0f0f8645f0eb6e478","6626cb6139312a6c3ee1b525ace3f2347cd90052","22a6a87e376768c5d8d59b9db3158ace62371217","18b36625c0be4f1a5f598478adf5c02937af3f72","9c72a32a9b9ae7c0d450e787ce9c49a654b2018d","ac1410ee22f8163cf0513b02a5d43054eb037424","427b168f490b56716f22b129ac93aba5425ea08f","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","ae0067338dff4e6b48b6b798776ec88a6c242aae","b00bb8acf3a573d7663222412160b60c0c6db796","0beeb77c16e7866a23991f3718b25312af55d3e9","1a8282495642e742f2840589165a41c3cdd63a22","4ffb424a6e8fee887bb70a7ac40ed77e7fa60ea9","0a616ae5e04499f6aceeb637bb4d2cd78e4e678b","c08d0525bd42fa1c24f9f5df72f4c8fcf7063b22","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","56d03ab8afe62e40c34cfb79607efa1ffac1988c","90fbffb3486e7e9668eb4d42bbc9e94d0b665256","8101b548f5b2eae2591dfdd989f6c15b9a4cdefb","a489d95fb930401c1f4b7d92bb139d271d49abbf","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383"],"id":"1272e219612184aa64b61d1d5c714f1811fcd407","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1272e219612184aa64b61d1d5c714f1811fcd407","authors":[{"name":"Yixing Fan","ids":["7888704"]},{"name":"Jiafeng Guo","ids":["1777025"]},{"name":"Yanyan Lan","ids":["37510256"]},{"name":"Jun Xu","ids":["47882783"]},{"name":"ChengXiang Zhai","ids":["1736467"]},{"name":"Xueqi Cheng","ids":["1717004"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3209980"}

Existing approaches learn the joint embedding don't consider the answer-related information, which results in that the learned representation is not effective to reflect the answer of the question. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method, i.e., Adversarial Learning of Answer-Related Representation (ALARR) for visual question answering, which seeks an effective answer-related representation for the question-image pair based on adversarial learning between two processes. The embedding learning process aims to generate modality-invariant joint representations for the question-image and question-answer pairs, respectively. Meanwhile, it tries to confuse the other process, embedding discriminator, which tries to discriminate the two representations from different modalities of pairs. Specifically, the joint embedding of the question-image pair is learned by a three-level attention model, and the joint representation of the question-answer pair is learned by a semantic integration model. Through the adversarial leaning, the answer-related representation are better preserved. Then an answer predictor is proposed to infer the answer from the answer-related representation. Experiments conducted on two widely used VQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Adversarial Learning of Answer-Related Representation for Visual Question Answering","journalPages":"1013-1022","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271765"],"entities":["Answer set programming","Benchmark (computing)","Discriminator","Feature learning","Kerrison Predictor","Modality (human\u2013computer interaction)","Question answering","Semantic integration","Software development"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["23d2d3a6ffebfecaa8930307fdcf451c147757c8","50bc8a4e7e6ab9837c6244b29ff800f523494d65","b2624c3cb508bf053e620a090332abce904099a1","1eda03469d860ac725122bd27faaae6b2cb47d0d","108961c7366e36825ffed94ac9eab603e05b6bc6","115808104b2a9c3ab6e2e60582ab7e33b937b754","0217fb2a54a4f324ddf82babc6ec6692a3f6194f","61060bea27a3410260988540b627ccc5ba131822","0e3e3c3d8ae5cb7c4636870d69967c197484d3bb","46aca9fd693cda49f7f02d575efaee0977f078c7","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","20dbdf02497aa84510970d0f5e8b599073bca1bc","859e3afc4b8e7662a6bf29723863e9d5ca14d14c","1d060730d49e62343b70ce0434341b9161e8ef17","d372629db7d6516c4729c847eb3f6484ee86de94","9a6268d2bc1221ea154097feadea0c58f234d02f","247b14570940601f5c7a2da1db532ecf1c302288","4761f0fd96284103ecd3603349c7f8078ad28676","d740d0a960368633ed32fc84877b8391993acdca","228db5326a10cd67605ce103a7948207a65feeb1","35b0331dfcd2897abd5749b49ff5e2b8ba0f7a62","173a38768848cfe57a6b20b5ae019ce613e58781","384ac9d963e1fc8b2a1573e980a7c559b97575d6","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","4659d36f89c7bd422f077300f7d2798a0c3cef40","33261d252218007147a71e40f8367ed152fa2fe0","4991785cb0e6ee3d0b7823b59e144fb80ca3a83e","fe466e84fa2e838adc3c37ee327cd68004ae08fe","7fda1edac608bc67e55ac3d7c9dc5a542d8f8aee","0910a4c470a410fac446f4026f7c8ef512ae7427","0c3b4d51d5e64d27439b022c742abe63325ed771"],"id":"c67d62592ff24a25764e489a8a68672d40f50da7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c67d62592ff24a25764e489a8a68672d40f50da7","authors":[{"name":"Yun Liu","ids":["47909637"]},{"name":"Xiaoming Zhang","ids":["46447760"]},{"name":"Feiran Huang","ids":["1939569"]},{"name":"Zhoujun Li","ids":["1707275"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271765"}

Because the mobile search is different from the desktop search in terms of the search tasks and the presentation styles of SERPs, whether the approaches originated from the desktop settings are still valid in the mobile scenario needs further investigation. To address this problem, we conduct a laboratory user study to record users\u2019 search behaviors and collect their usefulness feedbacks for search results when using mobile devices. By analyzing the collected data, we investigate and characterize how the relevance, as well as the ranking position and presentation style of a result, affects its user-perceived usefulness level. A moderating effect of presentation style on the correlation between relevance and usefulness as well as a position bias affecting the usefulness in the initial viewport are identified. By correlating result-level usefulness feedbacks and relevance annotations with query-level satisfaction, we confirm the findings that usefulness feedbacks can better reflect user satisfaction than relevance annotations in mobile search. We also study the relationship between users\u2019 usefulness feedbacks and their implicit search behavior, showing that the viewport features can be used to estimate usefulness when click signals are absent. Our study highlights the difference between desktop and mobile search and sheds light on developing a more user-centric evaluation method for mobile search.","inCitations":["14cb1a501a812d1c5c37c1c0d54f7411c9799fc2"],"pmid":"","title":"Investigating Result Usefulness in Mobile Search","journalPages":"223-236","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a81e/b4f2e2cbb51d4799f146bf1b5e2971870604.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/publications/ECIR2018.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_17"],"entities":["Desktop computer","Feedback","Mobile device","Relevance","Usability testing","Viewport","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f237e72b2d5265da4c213e3c69979395728137dc","d0cfaed38630f9a812706c75af94bc8d1db68479","0deba9d4ad88045fa1c6af2a1d6b507316df9e23","88fbf478fd5d0baa2c1d5cc6d0b7daea38893a89","61c0a4a8244a36b58973c62f40dd63797dd1a79a","3f1b205331062c0e9610a4faa649b8e07b353f9b","a233e80cdcf7492fe9878f067d8a2d06071b9fa5","e96e5521907bc2982d8f264d1a2c694332ed3e07","e95a1ce95b4f0e7b542b70ef80073b9525646717","d5c2c62baa3dac194e03afba955ba4c9db84a69d","f904fbdcc35a83002718de07630894af547d8b19","0b811838fbd235d10e627c9d3ccca0df0a94c13d","b569ba6196625937d7664194beb0f07fcdb5cc72","09c0211bf1458bd383cb984b577a9dce819d9bd5","ecdc7519f0e52b04b4a90acf8270d1b64bbf2c7a","35f41f503e9aa32297225d6ebcece74faeafca34","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","c0dd495d008dad9141d8cea5a5e146fe48884342","0a4baa9044f273ba3da73e0e7df19e198781bf6a","36987aae17d54bc9f3e2883644866d988129d901","a0f96a954ccb478440523ef36e67f01de51e6918","a67a2bc5e9f85fefd515c948691f5ecc03e560c1","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","4047d5efd1683bbd3280500c3244149089412024","3453d79657e8f3e1614e73608f92465ab7f5a291"],"id":"a81eb4f2e2cbb51d4799f146bf1b5e2971870604","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a81eb4f2e2cbb51d4799f146bf1b5e2971870604","authors":[{"name":"Jiaxin Mao","ids":["3340223"]},{"name":"Yiqun Liu","ids":["1783406"]},{"name":"Noriko Kando","ids":["1678892"]},{"name":"Cheng Luo","ids":["1755091"]},{"name":"Min Zhang","ids":["38898636"]},{"name":"Shaoping Ma","ids":["8093158"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_17"}

Among the various techniques for user modeling, there is fairly limited work on how to merge multiple sources or modalities of user data - such as text, images, and relations - to arrive at more accurate user profiles. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach that extracts and fuses information across different modalities. Our hybrid user profiling framework utilizes a shared representation between modalities to integrate three sources of data at the feature level, and combines the decision of separate networks that operate on each combination of data sources at the decision level. Our experimental results on more than 5K Facebook users demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing approaches for inferring age, gender and personality traits of social media users. We get highly accurate results with AUC values of more than 0.9 for the task of age prediction and 0.95 for the task of gender prediction.","inCitations":["02019b7f146cdf81ae899f146731618e3f9f6b9d","33cff42fa86e02031df0117749cb3ee9298ccc38","3e59a03363f8718c285934f3301a03ad7b8c9383"],"pmid":"","title":"User Profiling through Deep Multimodal Fusion","journalPages":"171-179","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://faculty.washington.edu/mdecock/papers/gfarnadi2018a.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159691"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Complementarity theory","Deep learning","Geolocation","Image noise","Loss function","Multimodal interaction","Network architecture","Optimization problem","Social media","Stacking","User modeling","User profile","User-generated content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["df1ec9f9be12c561e9cb4dfb03c8c9f87a51b580","6043006467fb3fd1e9783928d8040ee1f1db1f3a","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","5e439ba42e2da01fd2c9458d41855d0332e78d19","a66fe50037d1a4c3798fb0aadb6e9b7c5c8b6319","2b4b941b1d003cd6357aff531c298847824495ae","8a5444e350e59f69ddf37121d9ede8a818f54a3d","3ffbc27a37470ab670f14636c96e579bb976d273","9d8f9cd695a269773c4386c57cb0438e1b1a3d34","27208c88f07a1ffe97760c12be08fad3ab68fee2","5724aced24e10f371559e0e3b29e1aca76096b24","f0af0029293dc8f242894f113baf15d68228ec4d","eda501bb1e610098648667eb25273adc4a4dc98d","3ce5eb88ab2d6d3041c0cb4d9a328ec6b4a9c301","023cc7f9f3544436553df9548a7d0575bb309c2e","8355d095d3534ef511a9af68a3b2893339e3f96b","2012f32199adc88747d5a1b47c7b4ba1cb3cb995","1b4e9ddbf1c851e11b2532e69674704830f097c8","ee458bee26e6371f9347b1972bbc9dc26b2f3713","4a2e92c3ca4fe72ab321865aee84b81a9d11dcee","10195a163ab6348eef37213a46f60a3d87f289c5","aad9c378dc1485957ae8d661596462b2ec16ab24","0b9ef11912c9667cd9150b4295e0b69705ab7d61","a27e3a8fa727881b2a333aee0501714a3e839ef2","e9090508b9073763c6693983577137db2a41a25b","1b771544b3b1aa54243e0a1942275bee01f0a9f6","b554da42487697cb0d01a4146858e966c1d2404f","90fbd777cf57096e9292601dfe0dbab30198d40f","1b4b2346279cb5515c508017e6ca3e03f4b3869a","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","0dfa460a35f7cab4705726b6367557b9f7842c65"],"id":"493c8591d6a1bef5d7b84164a73761cefb9f5a25","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/493c8591d6a1bef5d7b84164a73761cefb9f5a25","authors":[{"name":"Golnoosh Farnadi","ids":["2086602"]},{"name":"Jie Tang","ids":["13436774"]},{"name":"Martine De Cock","ids":["4502624"]},{"name":"Marie-Francine Moens","ids":["1802161"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159691"}

Since releasing individual\u2019s mobility records usually gives rise to privacy issues, datasets owners tend to only publish aggregated mobility data, such as the number of users covered by a cellular tower at a specific timestamp, which is believed to be sufficient for preserving users\u2019 privacy. However, in this paper, we argue and prove that even publishing aggregated mobility data could lead to privacy breach in individuals\u2019 trajectories. We develop an attack system that is able to exploit the uniqueness and regularity of human mobility to recover individual\u2019s trajectories from the aggregated mobility data without any prior knowledge. By conducting experiments on two real-world datasets collected from both mobile application and cellular network, we reveal that the attack system is able to recover users\u2019 trajectories with accuracy about 73%∼91% at the scale of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands users, which indicates severe privacy leakage in such datasets.

Yet, texts often also contain Counting information, stating that a subject is in a specific relation with a number of objects, without mentioning the objects themselves, for example, \u201cCalifornia is divided into 58 counties\u201d. Such counting quantifiers can help in a variety of tasks such as query answering or knowledge base curation, but are neglected by prior work. This paper develops the first full-fledged system for extracting counting information from text, called CINEX. We employ distant supervision using fact counts from a knowledge base as training seeds, and develop novel techniques for dealing with several challenges: (i) non-maximal training seeds due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases, (ii) sparse and skewed observations in text sources, and (iii) high diversity of linguistic patterns. Experiments with five human-evaluated relations show that CINEX can achieve 60% average precision for extracting counting information. In a large-scale experiment, we demonstrate the potential for knowledge base enrichment by applying CINEX to 2,474 frequent relations in Wikidata. CINEX can assert the existence of 2.5M facts for 110 distinct relations, which is 28% more than the existing Wikidata facts for these relations.","inCitations":["57761435a76864b807c77a1e66ce994609bda7c7"],"pmid":"","title":"Enriching Knowledge Bases with Counting Quantifiers","journalPages":"179-197","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0f9a/f071653c6686b8ee05310417d4bc47f4470d.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03656v1.pdf","http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2629989:1/component/escidoc:2629988/arXiv:1807.03656.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_11","http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03656","http://www.simonrazniewski.com/wp-content/uploads/2018_ISWC.pdf"],"entities":["Digital curation","Entity","Experiment","Gene Ontology Term Enrichment","Imperative programming","Information extraction","Information retrieval","Knowledge base","Maximal set","Quantifier (logic)","Question answering","Sparse matrix","Wikidata"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","73626ee16f65b8a9d11741bbc890d759eacea9c8","0891ed6ed64fb461bc03557b28c686f87d880c9a","4ef9757c3dc854782d0952ca3315668e9603e41d","2b9cd09b949b7e69933d18ae408397e803987151","00a3f6924f90fcd77e6e7e6534b957a75d0ced07","513167c08db5139162710aad9b2c217b344df2c4","dd37480412bfa5b4340cc08122c1d6595716ba08","57b219132b634d1b4c634c92e58b9a1c8b3f60ce","65d7710326c059af852e6abeb6887fb184323ae3","1354ba1b6567f869065e9515a488bc031a00e25a","5d544dea9765311432d96307b182a80d5fa25874","5e35ab9178462c1f57a60f29c035dbecd6d3d0bd","20bd197114af847d23410a1a3de7dac563a60948","5b35981142209ad7d003ec4341b64f9a04005e10","568b038d39be18aa58149b174693172ed334f0d1","8f8139b63a2fc0b3ae8413acaef47acd35a356e0","1b97b4623cf2f183340e548e0aa53abf0f2963d8","a68e479d4e3ddeaa734df29ac6cd11dcfa0cf77d","12dbbc1f31d302b528e7d260b6a51fb280112ab3","8ad0e78a9619c50bcb3cae4a589ec9a5d38c437c","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","2b2c30dfd3968c5d9418bb2c14b2382d3ccc64b2","3c13bfa74e1650cffbdee2ba18b50bea6b0b26da","151ee8aedc97e7a388a8edd704ff13698a7af0b4","34ba24f51f8e1f15b9345382c3c3917a08b20325","db550f7af299157c67d7f1874bf784dca10ce4a9","3abf5cf3f15aaa44b331c3da3c3601590b2095b0","2132af47c82d5722b86747dfe3a9d7cf9e0bb4e1"],"id":"c7725540372d206a6e4333ba2170ab438c49ca70","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c7725540372d206a6e4333ba2170ab438c49ca70","authors":[{"name":"Paramita Mirza","ids":["2814289"]},{"name":"Simon Razniewski","ids":["2499758"]},{"name":"Fariz Darari","ids":["3350360"]},{"name":"Gerhard Weikum","ids":["1751591"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_11"}

It has also been shown that offering coupons to a small fraction of users may affect the purchase decisions of many other users in a social network. This motivates us to study stochastic coupon probing problem in social networks. Assume there is a social network and a set of coupons. We can offer coupons to some users adaptively and those users who accept the offer will act as seeds and influence their friends in the social network. There are two constraints which are called the inner and outer constraints, respectively. The set of coupons redeemed by users must satisfy inner constraints, and the set of all probed users must satisfy outer constraints. One seeks to develop a coupon probing policy that achieves the maximum influence while satisfying both inner and outer constraints. Our main result is a constant approximation policy for the stochastic coupon probing problem for any monotone submodular utility function.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Stochastic Coupon Probing in Social Networks","journalPages":"1023-1031","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02688","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271771","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02688v1.pdf"],"entities":["Approximation","Constraint (mathematics)","Experiment","Internet","Mathematical optimization","Mii","Optimization problem","Social network","Stochastic optimization","Submodular set function","Utility","monotone"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["549ad8bd845fc32d36b4d057d0b7ab91af310d76","555251fd2c4247963f430d51ef22964332111a89","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","b21b85afeb68446e07b6c0285cf948727d342f00","5ba8ca9bf9364b4f3313f40cad67c8e15a4351d2","d7f9c3253552e13f24c3b73bc055ef60388af57c","a679aaf7b91a1997c9c9acc1d81c0292c23db3fb","404ae4a2b31d5c2184861cf702f953e47db40cab","8e5158cd9ad82a88d880c379e6e724629229a021","89ee56421940d3d84bb0e6a32d1e6b57d871ff59","6e2a2e690ed9cd8cc4e0401d4edd7e541a88c557","f90b09c978171c8e067a392eee5ee4924e820ee8","2716e2a8f31288a2f402d6dfb886a4a79c5a9829","4cd73382dc17561cd276f276c61d5ebf39bf69ad","1120862afe84a80db85e1f997d1b7e7255d73b31","5a32fefbed0cfbd6e43a66fb7addddd2f8a0ef29","bed099c8862175a8f0256191a963fd48adb2226e","3a43c0c79f3fdb2490eb87efd299a0c7e8480a91","23a62b31e538b21ee99bea000d84be35f1f0bd4c","2308df24e9181b34f1c33feff434742cc0146742","4bb0f607c1f6be38ca720ad6913577a778cc2f15","d611db34db098729a6550d2c5c3fede87c745909"],"id":"a61aa8409834b8fe832cc422a4af45371582b312","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a61aa8409834b8fe832cc422a4af45371582b312","authors":[{"name":"Shaojie Tang","ids":["1682309"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271771"}

Similarly, rule-based systems have been studied for this task in the past. What is missing so far is a common evaluation that includes more than one type of method. We close this gap by comparing representatives of both types of systems in a frequently used evaluation protocol. Leveraging the explanatory qualities of rule-based systems, we present a fine-grained evaluation that gives insight into characteristics of the most popular datasets and points out the different strengths and shortcomings of the examined approaches. Our results show that models such as TransE, RESCAL or HolE have problems in solving certain types of completion tasks that can be solved by a rulebased approach with high precision. At the same time, there are other completion tasks that are difficult for rule-based systems. Motivated by these insights, we combine both families of approaches via ensemble learning. The results support our assumption that the two methods complement each other in a beneficial way.","inCitations":["f9967956754fad28d0a13dcae08d6a9b58b51e41","92cd044fcd3b95994785b10940254a257ce590d0","e31f2ddff57a2353e74bd2c5cac9f0a54a6a60c9"],"pmid":"","title":"Fine-Grained Evaluation of Rule- and Embedding-Based Systems for Knowledge Graph Completion","journalPages":"3-20","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d576/bff38d3b1c87f1c77e4ef15b05010bb0e615.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/lehrstuehle/pi1/people/rgemulla/publications/meilicke18ruleemb.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_1"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Ensemble learning","Knowledge Graph","Logic programming","Rule-based system","Test case","Turing completeness"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05","33bc88dbc11a7833e724d8754f2b16c64c6a8b8f","c2e4d8f97d85783895db2c7066b6f3199c08c68c","5b50842142ee3efdba0ba31dff322136cd42554d","9697d32ed0a16da167f2bdba05ef96d0da066eb5","5b9c2b3f85920bc0e160b484ffa7a5f0a9d8f22a","68a33a3afac65eb6e0fb3726c1f9c8b727f32a42","512a783b0daf2cedcdb1586c12b8a9f9fe571d40","a77cf5d0d0b8fa64890e66152c5f7f6fe75c9b7c","bb75de5280ff9b0bbdd74633b9887d10fbe0ae10","07f294070b61e4c8aab30425027e9d08d9474ce2","5f0d37e509ee09e13a45e13f9f50912c61e4afc6","3dd5b127b18fd1e7e36b2d8b4c97b06f9bf38999","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","55d176b92d5740d039e1c8ebbad025d460de9ae0","1d86ea624bd6d7f36aa29a0e5a3ae7fadacb7b8f","74606b052a17dd425bcc6cd1d05db153633c742a","f5160040907305b6943176105e9c0126486bc14d"],"id":"d576bff38d3b1c87f1c77e4ef15b05010bb0e615","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d576bff38d3b1c87f1c77e4ef15b05010bb0e615","authors":[{"name":"Christian Meilicke","ids":["1795542"]},{"name":"Manuel Fink","ids":["37685043"]},{"name":"Yanjie Wang","ids":["49415870"]},{"name":"Daniel Ruffinelli","ids":["8792454"]},{"name":"Rainer Gemulla","ids":["1777107"]},{"name":"Heiner Stuckenschmidt","ids":["1698459"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_1"}

Humans, as a valuable source of background knowledge, are increasingly getting involved in this loop by crowdsourcing and active learning, where presenting condensed and easily-compared information is vital to help human intervene in an ER task. However, current methods for single entity or pairwise summarization cannot well support humans to observe and compare multiple entities simultaneously, which impairs the efficiency and accuracy of human intervention. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to select a few important properties and values for a set of entities, and assemble them by a comparative table. We formulate several optimization problems for generating an optimal comparative table according to intuitive goodness measures and various constraints. Our experiments on real-world datasets, comparison with related work and user study demonstrate the superior efficiency, precision and user satisfaction of our approach in multi-entity resolution (MER).","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Automated Comparative Table Generation for Facilitating Human Intervention in Multi-Entity Resolution","journalPages":"585-594","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210021"],"entities":["Active learning (machine learning)","Algorithm","Crowdsourcing","Entity","Erdős\u2013Rényi model","Experiment","Holism","Humans","Kasparov's Gambit","Knowledge Graph","Knowledge base","Mathematical optimization","Usability testing"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b8d47b0c0b12dd77543e82e6bf6636ddd335cfea","1c2e8d2d63312c18944c9477797e65a0975361da","0736b8ac43fdad545adf074729a55c854b1a89ca","426386e04afc68d43b34a4fe54825de5e0060c85","3420d8a5bf5e3fcc92c688fd9bccf3aa42a72ada","2bdbef53c5d236a40f20ad7836b0ee95b46de2ef","33a3ad9983a4879f00d6ed38c5891bb67ad461e7","a7cb7de7329f1145626a3689349ce92e54f81756","09ad9778b7d8ef3a9a6953a988dd3aacdc3e85ae","70bcae7b744711369ffa7515a6c465e681667105","e94b95b8a6e2c057f7b6341241a6d0b3e0f5362e","63a8b8d36eb4fe275a135f9788ca25dec2da6d63","445d1bcb0a958cc405bfc69453cc7b323e36c369","0870b7cfd7383fbacf5eef508f35d6ea2e0d89e9","f5d9c0182d8578f7c0a99ad9bdd4ff62e5f7c68d","a83cb80dd4ed5160c66dbd31c7782b01e7a97170","2aa034dd84b4c3426aad52a9bf4d4aaba342cdc4","c669c8cb28c6d219419e0e904a795164e8c6be05","213cb7593934bc675c336f53dd6c61a3c799be80","aae411e740afc359717f3f8bee4fa403534b8c45","3c082c16a779a329c5e52a89314a1271c2aaafcc","870fca95bd140249485095d8b9c1c25a42f94def","c0a8c0e6ccf9882969ba0eda0b898affa015437b","6740d09575fdb2e6cf3f5ef554de1bbd4faadf20","45cf7ea736444e2fefc0ccbaf598abd110fabf0d","136f0afc6e9bf3b292f7f32bf1f3c2c28abaff6d","513f97b9e489e6d0b46c18ff60703ea8c5520438","52edce6d72120aab2c08129829f77b5b4ae9d72c","48fd283e386e937267949a877da85f3075afc689","24b8fb9cdcf47b21dc7333cb4e5b8f4016ef0c11","740ce07385d81c3e9ba1de0cfbe3a775b498d347"],"id":"d21af1362ec7cabb5a9a15c00b5f66304a3cd56d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d21af1362ec7cabb5a9a15c00b5f66304a3cd56d","authors":[{"name":"JiaCheng Huang","ids":["2873696"]},{"name":"Wei Hu","ids":["48594708"]},{"name":"Haoxuan Li","ids":["3105865"]},{"name":"Yuzhong Qu","ids":["1887019"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210021"}

Unfortunately current continuous query languages (CQL) lack the features and constructs needed to support the more advanced applications. For example recursive queries are now part of SQL, Datalog, and other query languages, but they are not supported by most CQLs, a fact that caused a significant loss of expressive power, which is further aggravated by the limitation that only non-blocking queries can be supported. To overcome these limitations we have developed an a dvanced st ream r easo ning system ASTRO that builds on recent advances in supporting aggregates in recursive queries. In this demo, we will briefly elucidate the formal Streamlog semantics, which combined with the Pre-Mappability (PreM) concept, allows the declarative specification of many complex continuous queries, which are then efficiently executed in real-time by the portable ASTRO architecture. Using different case studies, we demonstrate (i) the ease-of-use, (ii) the expressive power and (iii) the robustness of our system, as compared to other state-of-the-art declarative CQL systems.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"ASTRO: A Datalog System for Advanced Stream Reasoning.","journalPages":"1863-1866","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269223"],"entities":["Blocking (computing)","Contextual Query Language","Datalog","Expressive power (computer science)","Hierarchical and recursive queries in SQL","Internet of things","Non-blocking algorithm","Real-time clock","Recursion","Scalability","Smart city"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["640041b92eb7b478ee002953a7b716ccd9b84eb2","8688b1793b01218e8f4a5a50cf678920e99d37b2","e5d5167d565d9a4a35b1cddfae829c53f8ad038f","4785e0377e77b3abbb3efc4a5b8d9a5c7f05f5e8","29d0f0556502566f1615ff347b5f568bce46063a","128985b85556c30ad405863f2a34340049957616","0121f027706620d82bc494efc56456e379b3c744","3970a426b4245bb1f9c3a203278f5e98f54617fa","37c9a357b512c9e373fd12359fcff525fdbf5d4d","04afd5f18d3080c57d4b304dfbd1818da9a02e8e","d00037118f62d02fd362d51b1790c48cb02bb4cd","d396e0fab16f146fc34b85e8c93e23f77d50c1c0","a512812f72321eb4b198cc11cbd6755bfa71aa1c","243230d5b623f79c22750b42447e902ab07a2db9","201a5add33896165a50fb8111bf63175b84af3bf","3dc49a33f4d24a6ea05cb6685a75715a9738b4e1","01dd19809cd812ef9109c1870dbb9eeda82f846a","189ef562597987ef484b43ff2c9d3fca6b797309","2acacec2890e19a19d437805121240b968f3fdc8","17f66d7a69bf20b29602d943069eedcd1c07abff","9f948448e7a5f0cc94cd53656410face8b31b18a","ba49705a1e7e4cc523de4158748df3de66d9776e"],"id":"fe07334b7e92e76bf6e5e0fae1f12cd2dcd8f9bd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe07334b7e92e76bf6e5e0fae1f12cd2dcd8f9bd","authors":[{"name":"Ariyam Das","ids":["2499545"]},{"name":"Sahil M.

An index providing the ability to search using domain specific terms across multiple ledgers will greatly enhance to power, usability and scope of these systems. We have implemented a semantic index to the Ethereum blockchain platform, to expose distributed ledger data as Linked Data. As well as indexing blockand transactionlevel data according to the BLONDiE ontology, we have mapped smart contracts to the Minimal Service Model ontology, to take the first steps towards connecting smart contracts with Semantic Web Services.","inCitations":["e04f2b8d487a6dfd779bad80e99bdf44fa09ca77","39bd0ef354ab3980a508fff95e1c73d16f4a94c8","46476e606f823961858394ce6ae306f038ffa367","860bd441ca2614462914f2a3b9a217d045476e02","ffaef7f3604fb4e97a39b9032928b47fa422099c","5a0e7eebceec42686d39b42de17820f0781a61aa","cbf13608704432d8970e566b898606530dccb679","7bb7c92c0f9cc6ab9c41a6123f78c512d28da2fa","ebeba33d0e635fc8e6f5ff2703d9c527cc1d5c01"],"pmid":"","title":"Linked Data Indexing of Distributed Ledgers","journalPages":"1431-1436","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ae1f/4a870a3f6f6d03837cc7e3e765e344ddf7e0.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1431.pdf","http://oro.open.ac.uk/49736/1/p1431.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3053895"],"entities":["Distributed database","Ethereum","Linked data","Requirement","Semantic Web service","Smart contract","Usability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["17a9cb399576c7c023a38f32735f3464be933b6c","471fdd5fb23a0907f8773c93dd45cdbb6afe5c45","0200d453f5c995c87761e50976ed07692e257a30","79ee330676c159caf5dce2b2e004a76f966be126","194056f7bd7374266c8826a65f74b75b4065a5c1","a2ac63a9e807a6d9f94ebf4e11a3adf2560a197c","f1956e8be16faef940c0e1ea0a3a1283352f2be4"],"id":"ae1f4a870a3f6f6d03837cc7e3e765e344ddf7e0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ae1f4a870a3f6f6d03837cc7e3e765e344ddf7e0","authors":[{"name":"Allan Third","ids":["2906456"]},{"name":"John Domingue","ids":["1694523"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3053895"}

The effectiveness of current methods for high-recall information retrieval is limited by their reliance on human input, either to generate queries, or to assess the relevance of documents. Past research has shown that humans can assess the relevance of documents faster and with little loss in accuracy by judging shorter document surrogates, e.g.\\ extractive summaries, in place of full documents. To test the hypothesis that short document surrogates can reduce assessment time and effort for high-recall retrieval, we conducted a 50-person, controlled, user study. We designed a high-recall retrieval system using continuous active learning (CAL) that could display either full documents or short document excerpts for relevance assessment. In addition, we tested the value of integrating a search engine with CAL. In the experiment, we asked participants to try to find as many relevant documents as possible within one hour. We observed that our study participants were able to find significantly more relevant documents when they used the system with document excerpts as opposed to full documents. We also found that allowing participants to compose and execute their own search queries did not improve their ability to find relevant documents and, by some measures, impaired performance. These results suggest that for high-recall systems to maximize performance, system designers should think carefully about the amount and nature of user interaction incorporated into the system.","inCitations":["bc90ea025a1a32b8c4c7aa1381cf28d69bf344be","09cc0def1c33c231523f7cfd88c18e911f903e8a"],"pmid":"","title":"Effective User Interaction for High-Recall Retrieval: Less is More","journalPages":"187-196","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271796","https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~h435zhan/CIKM2018"],"entities":["CAL","Document","Electronic discovery","Information retrieval","Relevance","Relevance feedback","Surrogates","Systematic review","Usability testing","Web search engine","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8194179eccc4a2459f6f369cbed0f2921f7aa4de","c0aea7fcdd01f4f468e626f8c32538907ca5b188","55ba0516e63f4ec5410e95b770e56cbfa291b528","da7315129520c63e1b813da1d2732baa4c282a8d","3957369af4a66e6bbb7e5df4a90c309e251510b0","8cbd4c1087c1a3582df8191d87081dd060fd1283","8adf8ed13aef238713d78e52bff4876083892669","1b607341c7d1bb22ef2d3e565e6189d838bea6ed","17963c800077aedd3802b3e97d45c286ba953ba4","59c9da928fbf10da0c46eef255f14aba2a8ed9a9","a70a61769073e71116bd6ea4ad497a4ae692ad4e","9dddbe4640d0707793480aac156cac9a70a1bb1d","170fe340456f33ef288931162932a229f9114b0b","1e0eb72167944b5ed65a51b5fd4205e740513f5e","f6455b04df18a75fac365fa04300c80b1252c84c","43520ba60eb643f21494dac152002b650d808f09","bfa8438eb37e303b8bd0f22acdc76f0555e4a3de","88fbf478fd5d0baa2c1d5cc6d0b7daea38893a89","abf32f0e80d1c91dbc5e1fc2dfd27720294eb30a","21d991a5ad8c49f767e22e66c28d2726d734c5fc","d61c0b9d86f60ce2220be9ee2baf5009c5ce8841","98b7fe007f9382c4a39619ca44f100dcebaf0811","5185297b4c2f0fcc00ec183b2dde1565fc963376","c7ba20a46ddefed391655e2c60292d1b4382474a","9fcc3005da857a37d30939478f50cadb71f38f3e"],"id":"54328292e93ee6b9824e59bcd422960ee1a75344","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/54328292e93ee6b9824e59bcd422960ee1a75344","authors":[{"name":"Haotian Zhang","ids":["9184695"]},{"name":"Mustafa Abualsaud","ids":["3017884"]},{"name":"Nimesh Ghelani","ids":["3404697"]},{"name":"Mark D.

Discovering the skyline of such datasets over a subset of attributes would identify entries that stand out while enabling numerous applications. There are only a few algorithms designed to compute the skyline over categorical attributes, yet are applicable only when the number of attributes is small. In this paper, we place the problem of skyline discovery over categorical attributes into perspective and design efficient algorithms for two cases. (i) In the absence of indices, we propose two algorithms, ST-S and ST-P, that exploit the categorical characteristics of the datasets, organizing tuples in a tree data structure, supporting efficient dominance tests over the candidate set. (ii) We then consider the existence of widely used precomputed sorted lists. After discussing several approaches, and studying their limitations, we propose TA-SKY, a novel threshold style algorithm that utilizes sorted lists. Moreover, we further optimize TA-SKY and explore its progressive nature, making it suitable for applications with strict interactive requirements. In addition to the extensive theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the combination of real (including the entire AirBnB data collection) and synthetic datasets to study the practicality of the proposed algorithms. The results showcase the superior performance of our techniques, outperforming applicable approaches by orders of magnitude.","inCitations":["03ba26aadd035038ca7870b31deed1922bb82553","23323ba9634f395d01e01a1b3f196e5e14e5d6b1","70d95dd4b2f9165e2e87f84e774729b33ab02af7"],"pmid":"","title":"Efficient Computation of Subspace Skyline over Categorical Domains","journalPages":"407-416","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00080v2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00080v3.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00080v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00080","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133012"],"entities":["Algorithm","Boolean expression","Computation","Data structure","Organizing (structure)","Precomputation","Requirement","Synthetic data","Tree (data structure)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c6f457fb338eb8048cf212a1036c67dcd8eeb8f8","a401596b7c337afefe0ea228ef9cd4908429b43a","5dbe84872b42cb6167d3b601fdf68b4eb2d7f5d9","a6725be97c70a3f9c7719f23d4d8233e4771cdf1","10feecb5eebbb958439aabb2e10bd56739e315c9","0f7e7d9add82a37b44764bd706b60fddd97b13fd","d616e3a1b7df3e2101faf851eb7545920f033242","21ad2325794d3f3311590e53aa8415c3fbcf983a","25281e6fdc8f82a95da5c77c9c35a58ff13840f2","450555b3f6c0606d811f2bdf728a92bd853d79a7","85d542ce705eb3fcb923ca93d781d93c4a6ee061","18dff7ade61602daf0dab35289db6f8850c957d5","a40cb295b6c1633c549d5846cd9fe59c381e6920","e1f3c9b4da3c84ef47d357140e842d44056c8a98","fb8847eb47efd8e940aed0d88acba1e6fa354434","93cccf4711ae0cfbf1bbdf048c089eacb333f742","5d255fd0a6f2e4ed9c6d787995df51d3a6cb72dd","4a7960e5f9e16aefbed71ae5d437cd0ccfcfc48a","a45865044c56951daaccb8edbaf7c7eb6b0e601d","4e86eacde01d3ce8946a1559650f37938deac1b0","978017c3c2547ad801066937769015efef187434","534b6dee5e86587676047d7ff921cea970b7d95b","91c0b8036bba427cd3170b4d461e1be6b72232bb","9fb8f081e203cc0114ea93a1b19123aa164438b9","75953bf97b08ca3873be90a6a3d6974364511fc4","0ee04631e65ca7d9300dd2539c17ea6d624e0f2b"],"id":"182af3723ee9778581779f5d620460f9f0029ecc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/182af3723ee9778581779f5d620460f9f0029ecc","authors":[{"name":"Md Farhadur Rahman","ids":["2940261"]},{"name":"Abolfazl Asudeh","ids":["1717283"]},{"name":"Nick Koudas","ids":["1721062"]},{"name":"Gautam Das","ids":["41126273"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133012"}

These APIs classify entities using different taxonomies and disambiguate them with different knowledge bases. In this paper, we describe Ensemble Nerd, a framework that collects numerous extractors responses, normalizes them and combines them in order to produce a final entity list according to the pattern (surface form, type, link). The presented approach is based on representing the extractors responses as real-value vectors and on using them as input samples for two Deep Learning networks: ENNTR (Ensemble Neural Network for Type Recognition) and ENND (Ensemble Neural Network for Disambiguation). We train these networks using specific gold standards.

To find influential topics in a given context, instead of searching widely over the whole information network, normally it is wise to find the related communities first and then identify the influential topics in those communities. In this demonstration, we present a novel framework to compute the correlated sub-networks from a large information network such as CiteSeerX based on a user\u2019s keyword query, and to extract the influential topics from each correlated network. To help users understand the influential topics as a whole, we utilize a word cloud to represent the discovered topics for each correlated network. As such, multiple word clouds can be generated for different correlated networks, by which users can easily pick up their interested ones by reading the visualized topic descriptions over word clouds. To determine the sizes of different terms in a word cloud, we introduce a scoring scheme for assessing the influence of these terms in the corresponding networks.

Often the number of labels needed is too large to be created by the best annotators, and so less accurate labels (e.g. from crowdsourcing) must be used. This introduces errors in the labels, and thus errors in standard precision metrics (such as P@k and DCG); the lower the quality of the judge, the more errorful the labels, consequently the more inaccurate the metric. We introduce equations and algorithms that can adjust the metrics to the values they would have had if there were no annotation errors. This is especially important when two search engines are compared by comparing their metrics. We give examples where one engine appeared to be statistically significantly better than the other, but the effect disappeared after the metrics were corrected for annotation error. In other words the evidence supporting a statistical difference was illusory, and caused by a failure to account for annotation error.

The difficulties of this task not only come from the ambiguous and abstract characteristics of sketches with less useful information, but also the cross-modal gap at both visual and semantic level. However, images on the web are always exhibited with multimodal contents. In this paper, we consider Fine-grained SBIR as a cross-modal retrieval problem and propose a deep multimodal embedding model that exploits all the beneficial multimodal information sources in sketches and images. In our experiment with large quantity of public data, we show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for Fine-grained SBIR.","inCitations":["94c359b11d1664af9ac912e0140377af9a73e918","dd2e69465ecdcd67d5211babb9d1a6754468d174","e8a164266d496b77f45e1c0e297cf28a3292ef06"],"pmid":"","title":"Deep Multimodal Embedding Model for Fine-grained Sketch-based Image Retrieval","journalPages":"929-932","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080681"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Deep learning","ENCODE","Image retrieval","Information privacy","Modal logic","Multimodal interaction","Sketch"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["14318685b5959b51d0f1e3db34643eb2855dc6d9","d01af16689093cb1c6ad3db54e423dff683ff8ad","68d96226fb71daad7d1a4ccbda267062244d9bc0","10d6b12fa07c7c8d6c8c3f42c7f1c061c131d4c5","8a336adeb5115f2e70d65dfd9e7feed6e894fb3a","1a3f4d437dc546f4163dcfe4d2258bf78de2bae2","076e44dd24d1391a640cd6379d2306ace6b87a6c","d3bbd57899d938e8c4bcafbbda10ceb59638e4db","bc07e730d8d6e7b6f9e5b1d5e547772cb069634b","3099e25764d879995bd19c5f9bf4fc39df3c3d9d","29aa3dc15450e6eb46c34f30f0e224e5ea16615e"],"id":"9a5af8af77c32068ad590de11a44b01fe9ce5e39","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9a5af8af77c32068ad590de11a44b01fe9ce5e39","authors":[{"name":"Fei Huang","ids":["2166643"]},{"name":"Yong Cheng","ids":["1750263"]},{"name":"Cheng Jin","ids":["1751513"]},{"name":"Yuejie Zhang","ids":["7550713"]},{"name":"Tao Zhang","ids":["40953577"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080681"}

Given the wealth of information that can be derived from stored information and biological materials, there is a pressing need for structuring biobank data for more computeramenable analyses. The utility of first generation biobanks was originally evaluated simply based on the number of samples that they contained. Currently, the value of biobank data lies in how it can linked with other molecular and clinical data (\u201c-omics data\u201d), to provide new insights into health and disease. Linking data has thus far, however, proven challenging due to unstructured and incompatible data types. Here, we describe the development of a Next-Generation biobanking ontology (NGBO) (https://github.com/Dalalghamdi/NGBO) that is capable of supporting both Biospecimen processing, management, storage and retrieval infrastructure, and acting as a knowledge hub for an integrated clinical and translational research ecosystem integrating \u2013 omics data. NGBO harmonizes the instrumentation and procedures used to prepare and process specimens, and also covers terminology used to describe computational biology algorithms, analytical tools, electroniccommunication protocols, in vitro assays. Laboratories, investigators, and other biobanks would also benefit from the knowledge contained in the ontology, by the means of using NGBO a biobank data catalogue that can be used to map any existing unstructured data.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"NGBO: The Introduction of -omics Data to Biobanking Ontology","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8a40/5582df22d23ebf792c2a969347d392b20d03.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-02.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Biobank","Computational biology","Ecosystem","Omics","USB hub"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0839fe30a217ba1534a15b761b7242a6059bd4d9","ed1df6aa01ce65060b4614ea0c9f466b6e56e134","ea7b9587952ef1c8e251d000e6f8824d8a5e9086","47b9d5ba4b313b1c0c3db80f9ccec210e83140e7","1c944061d332474087bc7c6f88e055bab5f2d6ec"],"id":"8a405582df22d23ebf792c2a969347d392b20d03","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8a405582df22d23ebf792c2a969347d392b20d03","authors":[{"name":"Dalia A.

We focus on triangles within graphs, but our techniques extend to other clique motifs as well. Our intuition, which has been suggested but not formalized similarly in previous works, is that triangles are a better signature of community than edges. We therefore generalize the notion of conductance for a graph to triangle conductance, where the edges are weighted according to the number of triangles containing the edge. This methodology allows us to develop variations of several existing clustering techniques, including spectral clustering, that minimize triangles split by the cluster instead of edges cut by the cluster. We provide theoretical results in a planted partition model to demonstrate the potential for triangle conductance in clustering problems. We then show experimentally the effectiveness of our methods to multiple applications in machine learning and graph mining.","inCitations":["4ffc25f59c8b8eab903737f783da1d6bcc3fed09","39b4d14b4e8c05afd0e13b7962cf9bf36a7be95e","1216bc7fb8a9ebe66f48286b61eca226c68ca2f8","237eeda47984a10b7a59c2f27ebb00e1c209d2cc","92aef93febb71ef1d8debb9c589ee08d7f994d3c","c1725670bec01c42df7306e45d258ad992e97c6b","54d8b5eed9ca1fadd0e77c641388050febf7ed6e","279c7554634fd5748b67864e49cc95bab39e6ea3","e2fa1416e023f3a39294a094844abbf25f3f4567","49bab785d8a7a7a78bc71cce860acacaba111ab4","184234a97a5a1459f5c72be1480e17e7b350f534","053bc51ab3bf6505c973db1a96d04da2cf35c8ad","cc2101c1368c528a7def9bf9ae711d3725933ac8","e2d5dd9822cd6b504453b9dcbe1ddbf0327f6e88","8f9ead83ca03d7a432c3694bd0aa44ceebf0d0d4","0a0313534055863471898ab7cfc68c3e457872dc","6e5cfa21fe0b5a428a311f74d38c2c8b7388cf37","3b6b983008d7b1b15ba3b8eca29016422904129f","00673496dd1efdacce581d64238feca0c2a410d7","b4b603ff71a77a19c357adb8b9b5fdb48597d7d6","95c99e458b0dd7e22229d4bb1e0f278b8d0fd56a","b98d1736d7d4d03fbd7422dea2a33f72caa8bcb5","32441681ed22bab85aef2f72e88f43964eb540c2","45e2141448ffe1f16e135a8bd61413b036376a75","59b96dcfe7a19cb98ce00506ec474e3b2330784a"],"pmid":"","title":"Scalable Motif-aware Graph Clustering","journalPages":"1451-1460","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4a8c/d5b5d6bbffad273b5403851facca4e7b65a0.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06235v1.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1451.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06235v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06235","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052653","http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~babis/www17-motif-clustering.pdf","https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/6886-s18/papers/TPM17.pdf"],"entities":["Clique problem","Cluster analysis","Conductance (graph)","Experiment","Machine learning","Motif","Spectral clustering","Structure mining"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["00d89b389f112e6f4375b83b3c26acdd201717bf","0cf0c343ae17b0db4b5564b22480aa0415ef61af","0f3fd2233b51ec5cbbb46451f1f76996d7493450","fb573ad5463a30cf88d4cd6ce93b7cd3854a5842","0eaf38cd3d7c7fb456201d59b6d28b084010d358","0ae474036f6684b0b2333e7a7d09815efa8b037f","c47330a3a60a00736d86048472e4b19d18bd3885","5478c84cc163d656c2bb7c5ae6857d4df9e8787b","08761f82913ce39f57fa1298b5efafa527d6f1ba","3628ce942f3039ab75e0f0f62be7d08469caa362","2a005868b79511cf8c924cd5990e2497527a0527","5aba6cd030f094d8c0ccf3a143371c37c396451c","eb66482fe6a11ddd83dcf9886e66a609eda6fd9c","12d4ebe2727911fc18f1a6203dde2b1892057f83","8e1a0b89cf01cb5dd82b30bed640a7185b0c18e0","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","23279ca0b7f63ede92762c6d31d40472f63b15e2","a71f6d2d49eda16193bf5578662c11d3ed986355","6225106656fb9d685f4cd7d24c12ac8e5814f379","931478afaeb06b58b3888b1c78456c8a2bd8ee44","9b90cb4aea40677494e4a3913878e355c4ae56e8","107971a12550051421d4c570b3e9f285df09d6a8","12a5bb62bdd4cf99be1488fc6ab1429dd62a6cc1","147550d5b61b77f082371bdfee0ba0eac09bb391","164f7422f2dfa481179ed34f6e180b0bb60f4174","9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d","481061586800e4018442f02634834c0706e2c7e3","b8d99088d0827f147efda85a54cf36aa02c036e0","71e5a6c95ff476c303c3adeae0c1a4387485f733","9f82001048320f27ca93f74653ff933b3e8bb963","0aea7c981f3c0bf140bbe30b135ad1d87eab3503","2dd0e306d9afe1999af4a1572e63a2bd41c9431d","e0f3b3a8fe02221e9618f86cbb554420e7619261","d9b3b84b415fbfcd63f2afd6fae9388a51e65e57","1437415df29d3927c7851c7a0db0edd4a472d6e1","8b64db892961f87853c9ffa50d04ce43320f2c13","5f944a6722a6e0f2114e8fd1262eb01ede6d5b9d","121e53ccc22cbf6aa453a221fcde294b1fcffe60","dc753ef05a4c8ef8e81aedf7a3911530742e7baf","e0d2861a9022667a93a8a0573d44f238f7c3a027"],"id":"437a492ddaf7a68a4634036897f528e2c9dbc349","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/437a492ddaf7a68a4634036897f528e2c9dbc349","authors":[{"name":"Charalampos E.

Although considerable research efforts have been conducted on this topic, we can still point out two significant issues unsolved: i) single-valued assumption, i.e., current methods assume only one true value for each object, while in reality objects with multiple true values widely exist; ii) sparse ground truth, i.e., current works evaluate and compare existing truth discovery methods based on datasets with limited ground truth. Therefore, the empirical studies might be biased and cannot legitimately validate the existing methods. In this PhD project, we propose a full-fledged graph-based model, SmartMTD (Smart Multi-valued Truth Discovery), which incorporates four important implications to conduct truth discovery for multi-valued objects. Two graphs are constructed and further used to derive two aspects of source reliability via random walk computations. We also present a general approach, which utilizes Markov chain models with Bayesian inference, for comparing the existing truth discovery methods and validate our approach without ground truth.

The DP has two input parameters: 1) the cutoff distance and 2) cluster centers. Also in DP, different methods are used to measure the density of underlying datasets. To overcome the limitations of DP, an Adaptive-DP method is proposed. In Adaptive-DP method, heat-diffusion is used to estimate density, cutoff distance is simplified, and novel method is used to discover exact number of cluster centers, adaptively. To validate the proposed method, we tested it on synthetic and real datasets, and comparison are done with the state of the art clustering methods. The experimental results validate the robustness and effectiveness of proposed method.","inCitations":["c61f49079634131f5f0f2bd4c787e6839c6d98e8","00a680933349e39687a5432d51650735e443b885"],"pmid":"","title":"An Adaptive Method for Clustering by Fast Search-and-Find of Density Peaks: Adaptive-DP","journalPages":"119-127","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054148","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p119.pdf"],"entities":["Adaptive histogram equalization","Cluster analysis","Synthetic intelligence"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["25ebaeb46b4fb3ee1a9d6769832c97cdece00865","1389d5e6de60baca6b5f2f6147d9f5f4b9fb2ef6","6ccf50496e73a69535f50262bd3dba7548677fff","23e755d3e9f729bb3fecb327bf2c1c1ac8292e22","fc28a7a4823d91550254ad7a93a6031991714e3c","8aa4a200ddc86ebe19922dfacec8d0e8cfe3340e","1fbaa51a428f045d7425d88d8827699adcef6ba7","7ac51fa1c00985c13818def3c12d98a0c1e4a263","1faa856958fd22125dff44c40d5fd7ba92e7cb3b","726fe0171864a150f41cab23dbc9153a3aba16e9","debf4c77b8a2a3610c112283bec4e2c13f21a8b6","d002c042ee9516231f44ed7dfb03bec7ece8289b","990bb605eef13c7ce7e7ad1095e1096464956da3","98431da7222ee3fe12d277facf5ca1561c56d4f3","c0092736e4ed69bd792648ff542262208f90f06b","db35422ad075ce5fa5f20c97edffb553cd0c441c","b0b8757e6b327180824f01514cfb81b1e2823550","c36240168944947ff2dfa375a1bd79a030e6eab7","13a375a84a6c414b85477a401541d3e28db1e11a","f22046b49561c37de844de62f2c70077e2aeee92","5b5a019a5fb3db61971204a5a51702b4c2ebf3e2","1c168275c59ba382588350ee1443537f59978183","08ab6872194cb51873d0c9f5057002c852bd7127","5b6dc1cdc8f07504176aa27f5fcf810398732b65","c37a9ced7fb89e999e66f41eb862934dd2d7791e","947e492f2d3163202533d991fe02409608e042f1","e7cfd0cf9909599f7af677c83b492bad94ce7dc4","c130cc0b9fa46ef2810224f49994a13600bdf805","cceb5c0bf6056ad0bad59cf3b39d17623bf0baef","a718b85520bea702533ca9a5954c33576fd162b0","3f297f15976b2ffb58c8d2e46472c8c192b0daef","856a91b5521f40db63cd730686e3eeb3a1411182","cc64356e805d7b7f113504ba49f5a7b45df38ecb","ab696bedb8945ca79d4c3bd686393396ddcc219f","1be16d8c557b15cdf2db9e7eb4453f2274fd60af","a988a8c89cc1de75c9cbca88c17b2e8afb04a1e4","03d6b40caff82c191d5329d6355c1c57abcd9d8f","0d54a0f443d08290d88019196e4edfb0741b8eb6","0d5017f05a9b4db635a013dab8dec06855a96dee"],"id":"f7371f9d3b098129ed244990cd9f973abfba92f7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f7371f9d3b098129ed244990cd9f973abfba92f7","authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Ruan","ids":["35062170"]},{"name":"Rashid Mehmood","ids":["1715632"]},{"name":"Ali Daud","ids":["40247823"]},{"name":"Hussain Dawood","ids":["2464264"]},{"name":"Jalal S.

In particular, we look at whether the use of recommender system can affect user experience and user opinions in a systematic way. We define and analyze three metrics to understand those effects - intensity, simplification, and divergence - and we explore both link-based and ratings-based recommender systems. Our results suggest that previous studies of this problem have been too simplistic, and that user opinions can evolve in complex ways under the influence of personalized information sources.","inCitations":["e89a36f18483c8450d2a558d8587e457b816a883","4c8e9aaa5a16f5918a7ef043c23733310cbfbb76"],"pmid":"","title":"Closed-Loop Opinion Formation","journalPages":"73-82","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091483","http://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/crovella/paper-archive/netsci17-filterbubble.pdf"],"entities":["Dynamical system","Level of detail","Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3","Personalization","Recommender system","User (computing)","User experience","Vergence"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["59839c895a0cddcad0e4efdc953d5ccad302f115","7a8980eea123975c5e38aa7e91a821c01b051119","a06d6219d6724f7a5ae0e4d8b4b03f9d2efba620","68b8e2f79e8e0b4f674cdbc9bfc2afbde5e94c8e","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","0886e182f8e06f14378111d1c996bdf46a2fd1e2","c8665198592b52ba122e5cf84032a9bc1c61eade","5db2474d3a1ac21a9efb24ba742b808ce79f5464","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701","2014d34e2ed6e3475fd2ddfa6bb06168602c2ade","31c67f575b468fa760b64abbe852b81a0abf14c5","71db8c8cc644d69a36bf59e69e247eeda7b2eaeb","049eb75c64d8b80b62d6227a6b628e8bdef0e216","098c57f75479813c2cdc848ab16ef41d87353702","0a86de84670457c76e85ee20053e684495c555bb","81a809b9b5ac940778fe2c7c9fe6df262fec927a","60cad48b0e0ae74a5ec0025aa791045a07f4928e","a60fddf04a5ba89b3bc5f80dbd4e0c2f9321b8f2","9916eef828b461051d4c0b090e82aef8d4855485","323c2f1ed4bd17013e30d31495ace253e4356dca","1d89a12092d6323b9d3b1a5bd4e6790897e2a2be","154e504956cbbc8ddfd2e0aa420333f81f1183c9","64edd2c5c41e856695e1dcb950c0512c3a87edec","7882de8fc50ff82c2440b217b300e455b53be6cb","aa800cc1af75cdcecae9875185b0ede5c04f1d6b"],"id":"d050014162b0207fa8062ebd7dc6dcb2216acf46","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d050014162b0207fa8062ebd7dc6dcb2216acf46","authors":[{"name":"Larissa Spinelli","ids":["2402131"]},{"name":"Mark Crovella","ids":["1685445"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091483"}

The RDF graph is often obtained by materializing source data, following the traditional extract-transform-load workflow. Alternatively, the sources are declaratively mapped to the ontology, and the RDF graph is maintained virtual. In such an approach, usually called ontology-based data access/integration (OBDA/I), query answering is based on sophisticated query transformation techniques.

Although we achieved a measure of success, the reality was very different from my expectations. It turned out that end-users cared about search relevance only to the extent of reaching for buckets of vitriol when search failed to find what they wanted, and people making purchasing decisions were more interested in other things: what repositories can be included in the search, how responsive search is to updates, what security models are provided, the appearance of the search pages, and achieving internal business goals -- even at the expense of end-user needs. Organizations often purchase search technology as part of another system, such as a content management system, or a records management system, leaving other repositories unsearchable or incompatibly searchable. Causes of enterprise search failure include dimensions studied in IR but an ES system often fails because of the way it is configured, or because it fails to cover information resources that end-users need. The dream of a comprehensive, highly relevant, fully secure single search interface to all of an organization's information is very rarely achieved. There is a huge market potential for a killer ES product but the biggest challenges in exploiting it lie outside the scope of IR research. I look forward to sharing lessons learned from attempting to commercialize IR technology, and new perspectives from my current employment at Bing.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"MAPping the probability of start-up success","journalPages":"1345","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3096467"],"entities":["Content management system","List of Code Lyoko episodes","Purchasing","Record Management System","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"97f341271ee49fa813086787ebf3d200f861ebba","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/97f341271ee49fa813086787ebf3d200f861ebba","authors":[{"name":"David Hawking","ids":["1718817"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3096467"}

In a clinical setting, automatic query generation provides a means of retrieving information relevant to a clinician, based on a patient record, but without the need for the clinician to manually author a query. Given verbose patient narratives, we evaluated a number of query reduction methods, both generic and domain specific. Comparison was made against human generated queries, both in terms of retrieval effectiveness and characteristics of human queries. Query reduction was an effective means of generating ad-hoc queries from narratives. However, human generated queries were still significantly more effective than automatically generated queries. Further improvements were possible if parameters of the query reduction methods were set on a per-query basis and a means of predicting this was developed. Under ideal conditions, automated methods can exceed humans. Effective human queries were found to contain many novel keywords not found in the narrative. Automated reduction methods may be handicapped in that they only use terms from narrative. Future work, therefore, may be directed toward better understanding effective human queries and automated query rewriting methods that attempt to model the inference of novel terms by exploiting semantic inference processes.","inCitations":["f424eb44c2988f79444d86de51fbec89d2020b90","0cff5ca9148ae2f76cd02331f68491137b20c400","147d789cc366b10972401b48f4d99dd5eea1e51e"],"pmid":"","title":"Generating Clinical Queries from Patient Narratives: A Comparison between Machines and Humans","journalPages":"853-856","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080661"],"entities":["HTTP 404","Hoc (programming language)","Humans","Human\u2013computer interaction","Query optimization","Rewriting","Tf\u2013idf","Type inference"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0baa5f80bdaa688ba970d15047ffd5192b7be91b","6210785d964aafa31e1db4fa7761b9c30f67b397","0517f1c7dee7621c67e9fcc6424ff856793510d7","45d35d65b344e07349e91f6d4b40196fc7a92acc","1c09bbe0603fde278384d8858d0d6f767a921ceb","6d0a5a4e7c315422c4513c377d9938c706457d7d","38ad6b8a22e5089edebd28674060fe8c0a127513","1918b0273933ffa9f85a4b072bdac7b68fc3f3e2","14b69114783f65bb9f5245dbfd08323da0cc550e","a670e9a5bbfffe338125a7fcfade30943f474b03"],"id":"82a2edbe8f290a49c97901d2f7139a6ba88c2041","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/82a2edbe8f290a49c97901d2f7139a6ba88c2041","authors":[{"name":"Bevan Koopman","ids":["1783566"]},{"name":"Liam Cripwell","ids":["13668934"]},{"name":"Guido Zuccon","ids":["1692855"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080661"}

Conventionally, this task is decomposed into two separate subtasks: target detection that identifies whether each entity is mentioned in the text, either explicitly or implicitly, and polarity classification that classifies the exact sentiment towards an identified entity (the target) into positive, negative, or neutral.\n Instead, we show that attitude identification can be solved with an end-to-end machine learning architecture, in which the two subtasks are interleaved by a deep memory network. In this way, signals produced in target detection provide clues for polarity classification, and reversely, the predicted polarity provides feedback to the identification of targets. Moreover, the treatments for the set of targets also influence each other -- the learned representations may share the same semantics for some targets but vary for others. The proposed deep memory network, the AttNet, outperforms methods that do not consider the interactions between the subtasks or those among the targets, including conventional machine learning methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning models.","inCitations":["5872b41cbb4f8b920bc9286a4fcd10385ddd353b","beb138ff8b18dc0b4454ba555197141a2b09b966","30b3aaebda73d934cea368249b73f8a0ae21f742","7c595b2c81ad4f05eb5c659de4d856e0d317dd0b","247073acc29cd6dc8a01792b149be06d89ae5d86","c77947a8b69d77269f7129ee937f00122b46e26e","0d310cf7f829b8704c591be6f55e98f78b288a34","9e63233e36f70361c3fb00b2a2894951e7606852","6e279973506f42868590d88e4cc01e1c4febb034","2f95752cda40f175752e331090b49ec4f8bc7c64","f5b690fd3fda181a1409b1ab5d3ff441da4f4425","e90081bc94e3a6ed972c77fd777347a3df090531","2b91a2cbcd9cce902cbc8da78fec5f18f4bffc98","f5205433ab7ff175bcb710697f5d44856ad0b3b2","cc76c27ad3f6d34df56fdadf86a5a53937ecd132"],"pmid":"","title":"Deep Memory Networks for Attitude Identification","journalPages":"671-680","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018714","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.04189.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.04189v1.pdf","http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lichengz/papers/wsdm2017-li-memory.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04189"],"entities":["Deep learning","End-to-end principle","Entity","Interaction","Machine learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","ecfdfcd1ef21449a01701122745a7be5ba135e7f","7348bdc5415fc87977777a0d40407dd020aa54eb","73cf7c10f1b7a30089b201d924f73f342b64c2bc","27ee75e2047bac3ae9fc3b4f09aa610d14104f5c","303b0b6e6812c60944a4ac9914222ac28b0813a2","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","2e8d01e2fcf7ad7bfc889360a7c9c495effbdc34","820843544be57efa903ce14d6967b0eeafd6a7ed","1256c05bd50a80bb0a223ca94674c71fd61fad5a","32cbd065ac9405530ce0b1832a9a58c7444ba305","d4019b7d8c20203e24a4252d845d15c4072b86a9","5e9fa46f231c59e6573f9a116f77f53703347659","937cf0ed6304751e5ffd80f1e7af64a4253feede","0f16f6f478b5c788dce466eb50e36c612273c36e","e6bef595cb78bcad4880aea6a3a73ecd32fbfe06","87fe8163dcaff9b5cb759439c47c2c4661c78829","27e38351e48fe4b7da2775bf94341738bc4da07e","2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","173920744d0a70a29f891466492576fbdd18ba03","1ad85ad6a4b616655da3b06e6e70343755042a87","78f8901f907e1b2a6ceff139aabeca5a438a12b4","0b7ec645545f4bd58d8e249d034ef177c55a076e","25e44679b20098b14208c17cd0914edec7a8a1a7","872182b8d8825d3bb1fd15f71bbdbdda19a259ba","cbef47e24e699f4f96430382a6d6f143b27d3c44","28f4fb05ddae33ee998291b19e64373976ebaf31","178286f3640f9c5c8c129799d6b00f313481d13a","06e122f475a21d92dba137609c40f35690217475","6aedc02edbd48c06a70b3e7bfef8888ded61c83d","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","688d8718e662d931d8c0ab1bfd03314c2ba711af","234bca5bb8ee713d168b77f1d7729c23e9623c1d","32a437ecdc20cc76c01e37c08920317ea18fde50","0ec57ff75062a6e557998079578587efc869e105","e5a241df2f4bc8dca3763131571a2145d139f426","13e5f0c40c85ca8e01b3756963d5352358de7c29","8bbcded0c093f62bd2a54cad58bcc8114aed5aa6","5085a20e568191edc929146939fde98b273ab99b","6c6bf6d6b6f718089cc720ccbb16f7d31f6dad41","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","3811ba132e669b1d94938df0636897ce957cc170"],"id":"04850809e4e31437039833753226b440a4fc8864","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04850809e4e31437039833753226b440a4fc8864","authors":[{"name":"Cheng Li","ids":["46651787"]},{"name":"Xiaoxiao Guo","ids":["1955964"]},{"name":"Qiaozhu Mei","ids":["1743469"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018714"}

Humans can provide more insightful information for these difficult problems compared to machine-based automatic techniques. Nevertheless, human workers can make mistakes due to lack of domain expertise or seriousness, ambiguity, or even due to malicious intents. The bulk of literature usually deals with human errors via majority voting or by assigning a universal error rate over crowd workers. However, such approaches are incomplete, and often inconsistent, because the expertise of crowd workers are diverse with possible biases, thereby making it largely inappropriate to assume a universal error rate for all workers over all crowdsourcing tasks. We mitigate the above challenges by considering an uncertain graph model, where the edge probability between two records A and B denotes the ratio of crowd workers who voted YES on the question if A and B are same entity. To reflect independence across different crowdsourcing tasks, we apply the notion of possible worlds, and develop parameter-free algorithms for both next crowdsourcing and entity resolution tasks. In particular, for next crowdsourcing, we identify the record pair that maximally increases the reliability of the current clustering. Since reliability takes into account the connected-ness inside and across all clusters, this metric is more effective in deciding next questions, in comparison with state-of-the-art works, which consider local features, such as individual edges, paths, or nodes to select next crowdsourcing questions. Based on detailed empirical analysis over real-world datasets, we find that our proposed solution, PERC (probabilistic entity resolution with imperfect crowd) improves the quality by 15% and reduces the overall cost by 50% for the crowdsourcing-based entity resolution.","inCitations":["cc2cbed913704b4f8ef0d6461937a345a59abf4b","bf2c1741e7e84478e1a6e6779064c86a10ecd742"],"pmid":"","title":"Select Your Questions Wisely: For Entity Resolution With Crowd Errors","journalPages":"317-326","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132876","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08288v2.pdf","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1701.08288"],"entities":["Apriori algorithm","Cluster analysis","Crowdsourcing","EarthBound","Humans","MOE","Malware","Natural language processing","Network interface device","Possible world"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3d7efdb458ed4ceac72afad879960fcc853ff6ba","33e4aadc07e40513fcc3626c1d5930ec8934e411","7c6d0ef82e65ba599a1496d21a936ea91266c36e","1ec2d02bd12f3a357449cf1bbc67b6adf7cd6296","539f8a3046b8d6f74a271293e7571a647481e4e7","ba24bd33caaa38127664f86d1bb486ac508b8a47","4759b9e47a2139a860402512427d45b15f69e1c5","1c37b0b78434f415ced54c87615cadacd955430a","88cd4becf3587a8378e450a99ded801fbdb264e1","08f51a9138458f667f0c00d40b6a820c451c7d36","157852dd14a9b518bf62fa6511be0f02f5d04a79","02b8e2b9301f83005f0b284fec7ee2468ffc2cba","d84af7f39033a084d9ae95fe895d39b9ec5246dd","0a49b6a6e7ec1eecbe976f635d3cec85411ac5da","151673abe01271dc3fc37725c02e95e7970f3bed","70da1b284d1a4dd5e4c79594ca7bf52ad2e2a71b","31a290e6c99c5b2c87d6ba9de4e142db6bcd40e8","060bdc422872e375bbef9b1cd82fbf0f936d4691","71b76a4de9b1364be2905278b69e0912c5f70b3a","404d38143b1078fcb4329f6addbd781d2a99f9b0"],"id":"bffc9f6c0230a97d5ad5aa1eeb1a16649236b54e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bffc9f6c0230a97d5ad5aa1eeb1a16649236b54e","authors":[{"name":"Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi","ids":["3423701"]},{"name":"Xiangyu Ke","ids":["8766005"]},{"name":"Arijit Khan","ids":["1725060"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132876"}

LogCanvas segments a user's search history into different sessions and generates a knowledge graph to represent the information exploration process in each session.A knowledge graph is composed of the most important concepts or entities discovered by each search query as well as their relationships. It thus captures the semantic relationship among the queries.LogCanvas offers a session timeline viewer and a snippets viewer to enable users to re-find their previous search results efficiently. LogCanvas also provides a collaborative perspective to support a group of users in sharing search results and experience.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"LogCanvas: Visualizing Search History Using Knowledge Graphs","journalPages":"1289-1292","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05127v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210169","http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05127"],"entities":["Entity","Knowledge Graph","Timeline"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4ddcbb0919833b16466a9661b0f6e9553b77cbf2","32c57f48b4a2cce0b8dba19eec39f415dadd3cdc","6b620d14e6518011dca0e497b3e8dee42d5a70d8","0dbc02e649dee9899944c31a11316c1e41dda698","0cd74739064fabb1e302b71fbc24189f235b576b","51b5cecc3881f1608ce53c4229682f55e1787fa6","4afba04f92477aeb6bcbe3ad5a0d3176083a3a60","0aa7ba4d80ffb0d3827607899249e7950b5883bd","52aa034a1c1413e03e7895dab0a0b67549cf92e1","67c0339af5df01b8a9b14512276c3d9ebc4b7e09","7bba909bc4f20a43e021b1f6fb36dfbf03503a8c","3d6c51755473289f06d172e4a7365d1995fcfa66","756e05876940c3ac29d8eb138382987df8486e18","7d046e73f7e70935c33af9e32ea72905ed959d2e","4edacc8e241819cc0d633e06775172c4da691205","dda232b51cbede591eb722ebdb328ed004fb211e"],"id":"5a1208ba5c9506eeae994f163988fe97b3eca170","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5a1208ba5c9506eeae994f163988fe97b3eca170","authors":[{"name":"Luyan Xu","ids":["30483271"]},{"name":"Zeon Trevor Fernando","ids":["2019849"]},{"name":"Xuan Zhou","ids":["39637594"]},{"name":"Wolfgang Nejdl","ids":["1744808"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210169"}

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval.\n We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs docum-ent clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithm.","inCitations":["a40d778e776f32d4590e83bcad71b7961a2ed4cf","a1adb39f3b1e1ca608ea456d91ce1c899094fbfd","463a3f569ee574c6fbf169882b5b210e33e49c77","430d6adc79199d1591ca338030bb0e33d314e5c2","c7539eea31dfb8b9ec92d546918fecdd3728d49a","3325ca775c4e55b1033161baf036e57232fde1b3","5895933ec74bbb0c7d13af029e6eeb407ab59962","17d05c68fd5ab780461e67c2c39a915974abfa15","133a9e03e058d5e5918652a3a9320655ca1f84e7","ef63abacbd2f9c7b7992792ab5dc5ac6be4758c2","9b0be12db18aed79e5746c10bc830d3656306c06","813adcc1dc28c537bc62b294ccb8ad8f398ab2d5","146d23cd1bc6d5b862bd621f84a80a73689fb722","3cabe57654c55dcf11dd287b2904e1f5a2b43880","5596ea5d62621544a50c5a69aadcc7c36d7a7ec4","7089fcf42e0e3cbe28d0cb31806d1601673612bd","19c8f5e1f1a2b643ec8181b6fe9ef4a7da5465de","cb7d132f47a142cd4d07856e5e5530d4335d7dad","a9aaf2a06d588c6307a8ff43a2e2c0522d182e3b","b87f0e1bf293684e2f200785b7614b0215bfff16","146b157524728525a868af9038f8461bce23f30f","6232afe60326ab45c884ce3fb8bf9587216fe40f","084df4a650d43bf9065a4ad3092008e3e9b9e5d4","5a5e2bde9e864be13d213e2ff4efb95de8d99aea","069ad6d0a5e3920488c93f9b65eeb2dc79e02769","272fb0f5a5c60688d92cc48a585e67ee94bc26c8","708a0e288f992e28d1c374a4a4de9ea95d1fe508","55c6238d2285414586dfc8bcc39f487cf98a0c5f","8a3a0d3b77e87dd26bb6abe799a28532cb3fd15a","fe3b7bbe58352637a986a0ed79a15d2d53db363b","5b2c2802823e24a3eb4d9bb4eab519c981ceb6af","98b7b95a7feac218ecae9cc2a67c71978baf3fa7","9ea12d315acfdea6e2b4ec3b57913cb6b74419a3","22b469d24ef6a90bb71ca08c3161419545c57257","ab0b71dcad59a0abf64d3f1231a64f173f4a8752","d3acf6b165db612faae4cd1d861972d8f13d1985","f8557ab79904983d85bc214d0a708a75b1962625","de34e8810a6f48c7b886daedba9e5b9cc3dc7e43","342bdb6fb15709d4e3dd2c40e5c3aab82d57b814","3bc599477cd767625b788de503228494c17c85fa","a802410a09048c7e4023a5e532e88fa124dd2f10","b9385b13fa084b41cc168501ddd33a84c60a69b7","a746a04e256b77f6118a3dd0bc57f82907d8211e","4665b979d409e9878404ead82e87d787cbca270f","1fefb2f8dd1efcdb57d5c2966d81f9ab22c1c58d","2103dc71d3954fd40809f32a58fe7093884f7fd3","cc63ca42cdc46d3cfab5eb412875da3cf207b3d8","1592dca81ba62a31e5fada437b5b7e27209b08ce","048b8c6f4aee298928f3f08461e9ed830755c389","8701780d99fe476304a7d894f3cf53cdeda84788","b6892936efd8b28515dfcbef212a3ccc2d1bcae7","378d73e57d8e32b91af6bdef06b4af9bcb026a50","00c60b8a65f60a460c7747d4d4556af09cec7e62","5a017ffb0a9338aa7ef8a5f15e8924bf885db3c2","d0cb3ebc7fbe9b7198ac0d42195cb15961704a6d","fd2f754ac59713b9901b3166b3eb3c1393b6c2de","2fdba8b70fbdf0168274c50e5d6215ecc7e5b7b0","83638f336d15f9568160e045437d61d89abe8823","9d8b650cc0e4e9d60e70fe8ac23b950562c2e774","30b409d3ff41ad4382eedcb5258bafc7841f3dda","3b66bf9dafb97705fd86b5fca0b2d422a4c26557","ba4a36631a8829fd7e171736229f02839bbec7c4","5c5540420fcddf7e1d5099c52e58404237798def","f392418efba0b97654d41a758e970810dfef4147","764fb39acf057b52f9e1221f630e701ff56ea3b9","7c92701973599fe863eceb63268ec50eee13d036","21f58ee32727060e7f249b0924ad58e1d2965382","74512a39befe3ccb5f5cc6e8877a4f0719d869d0","309db76ab58bcc680c0ab342d6e95bcd00ab11c4","7aead20d736c22f37440694fae88f49e2b3a09b1","6cb52aea2297a3f8698eb37e569c66fc30d09ebd","dd1eabfecc556b4e345fa0b6bf6f16b619c85f74","e811b1768910464c8cf745d571b678aabcabf44b","e42889a930021026f11131abfad1fdd88b257e21","ac08c89009d33f97cb01235e917ea89620027a8c","dd6b8e78c2bd08cd200180f7aca79d7a0a86cdad","feb6e2a032c5f40f710b216dd4ebbc8d1e62d620","cb555640d70913872e9999311345e837c0e2adc0","fa4a98757f6def8578abe5a6227901bdb5ce818b","35f441565a613365d410aacc122a02f27c8c85c9","96423eb877a25b554b464d2ce1864531458a0ee3","2fa5c4abacf0fca50b375c61bffbb99dc5f194ba","3506be0d24d10a3df40187c804c7eb62e5a41d33","2c7a200108990841be24c8626204a21e84440df5","88bdc73a0d9832e1bada7cf92193e54c965cc813","02067980845f00bf8314311dfd198f726b44960e","0ef8201cb405ba56c9b69885030162248cc989cc","513b1bcc5727da422e4d7516b00e7cb997173bb9","225b70ab6b4fa393ce4e235bec8421b018242350","a1388a9271e385b289d8caa13ab2b03507c968f6","082434ef04ad7369d1782c13651f2198556ffffb","62a8939e4f566dcc816583e7f73068d50f1a4bfc","32bd1985d7eecc638adbd2f731322f0a45cb6b9f","f30273bb39f0cfce3944f6ad7ce1102211c3b612","1872d9670397b3b85dde1aa0059650ac6764afa6","405ed9fe07f901bb6a5745adc6535f306f104ca8","2d28ec21a391f23a0b5567d1d79f22c4718c2744","83a734d923d6dab103a8eb34e7bd8851272b3dca","36ce71c9ff15cc46b32ab35d30d4b3b1c58cbfc6","8c972e0bf28e111a5175504bf2af51bfb5383466","df306736e8278d40c271550759dc83e402726d2e","4855fc5506f367e1fbecfc4190097307c0809563","56df6a406396f233e4482311ff40dc7d5b3a7f1c","30b3454a04c5861494da0c15e4578f8afd8de4d3","1d298dc42312f8bc962138587af9b5448c6473b0","c86de3f4d4dff308464839b9c55d8919f06f3dd9","d9de5abecb343325fc4ff2ddfed651ef373d52b7","54f7c374b217fcfef0513bc2428299c7c13429cb","2c1f5977384f8a89ab91e5a2ecda3e08d2df1caa","48ac9b7a30285d749ca1114543a71d8b7acb22fc","7624860716abf1680b1f589df2ed8fa6b265bf9b","b7fe7fd1e35df9b15679b9d5d088e88a0fa0dc35","0faf98417be68e7486ef2e9cfd73136d39636c0b","37f24c7df419f461dab13f61768eceb574c74595","3754dee1d2a89b3bbd3e16f3506913ef704726f7","859aafb58fdc2ed30c758ab774b

A knowledge market framing allows site operators to reason about market failures, and to design policies to prevent them. Our goal is to provide insights on large-scale knowledge market failures through an interpretable model. We explore a set of interpretable economic production models on a large empirical dataset to analyze the dynamics of content generation in knowledge markets. Amongst these, the Cobb-Douglas model best explains empirical data and provides an intuitive explanation for content generation through the concepts of elasticity and diminishing returns. Content generation depends on user participation and also on how specific types of content (e.g. answers) depends on other types (e.g. questions). We show that these factors of content generation have constant elasticity\u2014a percentage increase in any of the inputs leads to a constant percentage increase in the output. Furthermore, markets exhibit diminishing returns\u2014the marginal output decreases as the input is incrementally increased.

This phenomenon motivates the need of truth discovery, which aims to automatically find the true claim among multiple conflicting claims. Existing truth discovery methods are mainly based on iterative updates or probabilistic models. In particular, iterative methods specify rules that govern how credibility flows from sources to claims and then back to sources. However, these manually-defined rules tend to be ad hoc and are difficult to adapt and analyze. Probabilistic methods model a few latent factors that impact how sources make claims, such as randomly choosing, guessing, or mistaking. However, these manually-defined factors may not well reflect the underlying data distributions. Given these limitations, we propose a new, unsupervised model for truth discovery in this paper. Our model first constructs a heterogenous network that exploits both source-claim and source-source relationships. It then embeds the network into a low dimensional space through a principled algorithm such that trustworthy sources and true claims (meanwhile, unreliable sources and false claims) are close. In this way, truth discovery can be conveniently performed in the embedding space. Compared with existing methods, our model does not need manually-defined rules or factors. Rather, it learns the embeddings automatically from data. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for truth discovery.","inCitations":["c9096ff6c758d90ebc4e69ba1fcbb3551169d304","7f80ec2656666fc6f7a136aa14dc790798032b30"],"pmid":"","title":"Truth Discovery by Claim and Source Embedding","journalPages":"2183-2186","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133069"],"entities":["Algorithm","Hoc (programming language)","Iterative method","Latent variable","Randomness","Trust (emotion)","Unsupervised learning","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1c2e8d2d63312c18944c9477797e65a0975361da","33efd3ecffca21efaf9d1469b7dc3d2a72a0a05e","24df5a3c48ea5d3b14df1fd5e45872818116c466","4f84bcbddad1e931b0328be6e0a96ca731c538f8","4607f09a348c87f95aedd7711b24d8bf614fe58c","26196511e307ec89466af06751a66ee2d95b6305","af2a807c5e32a35765850c6b6891f471d7bc7aea","40c6e880da4fa9d3266e2ce60342b20a1eca106e","0abb28823d51d6a644c78fedca0e7e96295df762","7e93a2538de5bf0e0871c87ffcb5a786f6f4846c","1a0f8261d8384bfefbf2d561d446c3a687a5febe","f94350a59508ce0175e33b3427ff0dd92ccc9abf","1b763ec4c21c799eef00ca26f6afc6c01b45a82c","579e1e9217cfed6d563cedf8f8fdcd1604fc0917","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50"],"id":"cd52cc0ac4b8e77131c9bf668e8f214230f7f9ea","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cd52cc0ac4b8e77131c9bf668e8f214230f7f9ea","authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Lyu","ids":["25883189"]},{"name":"Wentao Ouyang","ids":["8676190"]},{"name":"Huawei Shen","ids":["2476503"]},{"name":"Xueqi Cheng","ids":["1717004"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133069"}

In this paper, we propose an approach for sentence-level sentiment classification without the need of sentence labels. More specifically, we propose a unified framework to incorporate two types of weak supervision, i.e., document-level and word-level sentiment labels, to learn the sentence-level sentiment classifier. In addition, the contextual information of sentences and words extracted from unlabeled sentences is incorporated into our approach to enhance the learning of sentiment classifier. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment classification.","inCitations":["6d5fe2873be7e2b86d35ac180de5f7cd08c3bd3b"],"pmid":"","title":"Sentence-level Sentiment Classification with Weak Supervision","journalPages":"973-976","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080693"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Naive Bayes classifier","Sentiment analysis","Supervised learning","Unified Framework"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b0aca3e7877c3c20958b0fae5cbf2dd602104859","04ba531c6a51effc0af5f115bbd14f2b2f269fe6","919c73019cc6d9814679a848fa1aae353f848170","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","0d52f84a6ce865540936de1f1dd8155274717e7a","3405c26e87ce1c5bb277da7ccec971431e15c2fd","86c75de847ff50b4d6a6c7e83719f336e9daeaf0","bfa8775282a25dcb2b5127b87fa6bd67e007d81a","b59abcfd7dbed8e284c4237c405f912adb1ad4ea","13e5f0c40c85ca8e01b3756963d5352358de7c29","1fd185dc6966a3a62459a96291700dbb236bd65f","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","58e00cde75cf11589ca53e7d2e62179a80cad19a","02acc46ccd36ce4fccbdc594d3e8992874e69178"],"id":"62f890b6038f6d007cb31df37f2f176d8cf360b9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/62f890b6038f6d007cb31df37f2f176d8cf360b9","authors":[{"name":"Fangzhao Wu","ids":["2397264"]},{"name":"Jia Zhang","ids":["50561695"]},{"name":"Zhigang Yuan","ids":["34179005"]},{"name":"Sixing Wu","ids":["8175335"]},{"name":"Yongfeng Huang","ids":["1731776"]},{"name":"Jun Yan","ids":["48270296"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080693"}

Nowadays, e-commerce retailers are facing more fierce competition on price promotion in that consumers can easily use a search engine to find another merchant selling an identical product for comparing price. We study e-commerce data \u2014 shopping receipts collected from email accounts, and conclude that for non-urgent products like books or electronics, buyers are price sensitive and are willing to delay the purchase for better deals. We then present a real-time promotion framework, called the RTP system: a one-time promoted discount price is o↵ered to allure a potential buyer making a decision promptly. To achieve more e↵ectiveness on real-time promotion in pursuit of better profits, we propose two discount-giving strategies: an algorithm based on Kernel density estimation, and the other algorithm based on Thompson sampling strategy. We show that, given a pre-determined discount budget, our algorithms can significantly acquire better revenue in return than classical strategies with simply fixed discount on label price. We then demonstrate its feasibility to be a promising deployment in e-commerce services for real-time promotion.","inCitations":["69b0e11ea4880ff3854a4e40bc24937e8adb975d"],"pmid":"","title":"Monetary Discount Strategies for Real-Time Promotion Campaign","journalPages":"1123-1132","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/04c6/0b20fd94546e0517416d8c437dbca529a0d9.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1123.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052616"],"entities":["Algorithm","Book","E-commerce","Email","Kernel density estimation","Real life","Real-time clock","Real-time transcription","Sampling (signal processing)","Software deployment","Thompson sampling","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["cc547e30da4a8ff092b8182c170456adde4408bf","1ed4fa46eac7cab5443b0fc3d6a951f86104f5b1","0f16f6f478b5c788dce466eb50e36c612273c36e","5b8d44acc28ee24e5efb6337f78002b212383b30","d5318c04bbda0f8a1f91f6f6d11bc91313331117","22a8e8657f5e4edfbc4482c3781f5864c3635125","355a30d7116edc6901c4877fe5c393d73397887e","96675dce23113fee759714a6205157e5ef652d72","04b137b972fa56702b7ba6725067032091bf281b","769587883887e1327073eb7f13536f7ae8762c56","5776373e3e6c3a619252e2c132b5a4414d6c2271","5f155b2773ae2ee6f380c500fabd4328ec9d2119","123f66ccda6791faf42880f3cc61fa350dbe837c","e4fe28113fed71999a0db30a930e0b42d3ce55f1","0ceba5f5ad81dd7a735349e4f886351c848910a2","46034a94c55c947c037a9cfd605cabf0a29ebe89","0d8500c0f63c05c25d55b408787eaf4d357b6e00","3cdfc29af1b16a33d99e5912c539b2ca66053d80","74199fe0477d2c85fa30ab5622f56ac1a4382802","0c78161ac17a78dacca76546ffd36e7a5a243745","98710c4e93f064799d63efafffa7e7e584da429f","48124400b1433668f9c2e334baf75893cc0d4f21","1b3c86ad6c149941750d97bd72b6b0122c1d8b5e","5047f4eb460037988de612857814fe476bdf5c72"],"id":"04c60b20fd94546e0517416d8c437dbca529a0d9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04c60b20fd94546e0517416d8c437dbca529a0d9","authors":[{"name":"Ying-Chun Lin","ids":["47906094"]},{"name":"Chi-Hsuan Huang","ids":["47396816"]},{"name":"Chu-Cheng Hsieh","ids":["2054622"]},{"name":"Yu-Chen Shu","ids":["2057911"]},{"name":"Kun-Ta Chuang","ids":["2780321"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052616"}

In contrast to many search tasks, the objectives of product search are not confined to retrieving relevant products. Instead, it focuses on finding items that satisfy the needs of individuals and lead to a user purchase. The unique characteristics of product search make search personalization essential for both customers and e-shopping companies. Purchase behavior is highly personal in online shopping and users often provide rich feedback about their decisions (e.g. product reviews). However, the severe mismatch found in the language of queries, products and users make traditional retrieval models based on bag-of-words assumptions less suitable for personalization in product search. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical embedding model to learn semantic representations for entities (i.e. words, products, users and queries) from different levels with their associated language data. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) our work is one of the initial studies on personalized product search; (2) our hierarchical embedding model is the first latent space model that jointly learns distributed representations for queries, products and users with a deep neural network; (3) each component of our network is designed as a generative model so that the whole structure is explainable and extendable. Following the methodology of previous studies, we constructed personalized product search benchmarks with Amazon product data. Experiments show that our hierarchical embedding model significantly outperforms existing product search baselines on multiple benchmark datasets.","inCitations":["3ae5bef6b0c8317603a2deab2527383580904fd8","3bb2a5e883bb17563f763055e27837e19ae01761","c1a2a640da8a0a4b026e00611ed8341c161f49fb","c446971a5f2ca9825e97725f7f7d53311c1a1368","43642a638cae87af650f9acf65eb75d6b1f4a733","6a1d1c100ad3ebcace07048876414673c9c07613","02019b7f146cdf81ae899f146731618e3f9f6b9d","1d13f96a076cb0e3590f13209c66ad26aa33792f","1b2084f46e1133624438f87d3c3edba0bfd053fc","8c4eb0cfe00e15b26a41ab366e54acb708e7c1fb","ea92512cb91050fe1cdd55f8ed5c302272303ffc","389acfcf59c39b8a58c0c76afcd159adf0cb62ef","b9015d4f1e591eba7ea21c3566c919f80f7c2afe","9a482b9064eed10ef54d874d08b8a05246b42c9b","14a33be93ed24c5e947556f6b382135abe69fb11","97f1d08c306040401112ff0564f37e6c6a312522"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning a Hierarchical Embedding Model for Personalized Product Search","journalPages":"645-654","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://929153a2-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/qingyaoai/research/SIGIR17_ProductSearch.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crZLvocI2GouvXyPZ55TNtocmnJj3pWX27KDqjQJyAn6JLfyElAUhPi246LPBNohkDwwvfPLk5fxoMvpHSCcUUBIUpBvQv8xRsTsZzBToN4O3HSItDqg8J-79kZVWGE39oOKTm8QQOEomQrhUv4bgBZPVnXN9xshTdyHI7_XitI6jGts5FEPLd__qvh0eoO4fZ0agqz66dnQ34W_uiAO-n1b9rfMMdSVPFH_PYpnZ0UsIPLIks%3D&attredirects=0&d=1","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080813","https://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1260"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Bag-of-words model","Benchmark (computing)","Deep learning","Entity","Extensibility","Generative model","Online shopping","Personalization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","4d4d53a82d105f6d1b5c4a12778dd5667641c387","7a7d290d2feda000027831cbba76b7e38bf18c90","003055c1e7108975f88042f20321add41a7bdee5","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","6ff38efe7537b1f64c9c12c4781fc6f71a7b10ee","2d7f7c9dd68e86ef977a0294a35abb63d9c7bceb","d8b3bafeed46a7b5105a17a6507536c524ed8dcf","36cb4ed29f9f0b6ea37343b3d98154293a374ec2","2bb2ba7c96d40e269fc6a2d5384c739ff9fa16eb","f9dd22e0a3be85c2e721b3a0c4a735268bff0932","2b8859eb4774d2597cd68d5615f2fbaf408a1e6c","9eb67ca57fecc691853636507e2b852de3f56fac","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","22ae02d81c21cb90b0de071550cfb99e6a623e62","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","362d4eec03067fff5a05dd1a450ac7f5d20fbf2f","cca93fbe0534b8eb7bfe1602196aba78ad1bc184","73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","e912e59930acd9f63c9e0c0613620f28468eca0e","1944fda0d2aad86fdfac5f3c0d5c3b4055fa1336","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","0dc505b3d140d9349a2f4dd87cebfa97687f0c08","4ae093d626e17670ede21200f9cf1790e8c23dc8","8b40b159c2316dbea297a301a9c561b1d9873c4a","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","0ece9e2827d0af7f47bef2e14e3d8986556e1bad","17ce7734904a6162caa24e13a9454c1239924744","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e"],"id":"24d31924b294ee9e6c41425b43cb382c535a486d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24d31924b294ee9e6c41425b43cb382c535a486d","authors":[{"name":"Qingyao Ai","ids":["35531065"]},{"name":"Yongfeng Zhang","ids":["1739818"]},{"name":"Keping Bi","ids":["2112104"]},{"name":"Xu Chen","ids":["48282714"]},{"name":"W.

However, creating and maintaining browserless wrappers of high precision requires specialists, and is prohibitively laborintensive at scale. In this paper, we demonstrate the principal feasibility of automatically translating browser-based wrappers into \u201cbrowserless\u201d wrappers. We present the first algorithm and system performing such an automated translation on suitably restricted types of web sites. This system works in the vast majority of test cases and produces very fast and extremely resource-efficient wrappers.

However, such diagnoses from non-expert crowdsourcing users are noisy or even wrong due to the lack of medical domain knowledge, which can cause serious consequences. To unleash the power of crowdsourcing on healthcare question answering, it is important to identify trustworthy answers and filter out noisy ones from user-generated data. Truth discovery methods estimate user reliability degrees and infer trustworthy information simultaneously, and thus these methods can be adopted to discover trustworthy diagnoses from crowdsourced answers. However, existing truth discovery methods do not take into account the rich semantic meanings of the answers. In the light of this challenge, we propose a method to automatically capture the semantic meanings of answers, where answers are represented as real-valued vectors in the semantic space. To learn such vector representations from noisy user-generated data, we tightly combine the truth discovery and vector learning processes. In this way, the learned vector representations enable truth discovery method to model the semantic relations among answers, and the information trustworthiness inferred by truth discovery can help the procedure of vector representation learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we collect a large-scale real-world dataset that involves 219,527 medical diagnosis questions and 23,657 non-expert users. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of identified trustworthy answers due to the successful consideration of answers' semantic meanings. Further, we demonstrate the fast convergence and good scalability of the proposed method, which makes it practical for real-world applications.","inCitations":["c9096ff6c758d90ebc4e69ba1fcbb3551169d304","c15d858a3d6ad602594c3afba7347848dc08666a","da25dc304ec9961660434952195df252e098a0af","6b77cbfa239f814a4401a23b118ad068c78845c5","124516f6b307e4e71d6cc282182afa0b31200e43","14c85972b5fb4abc0f2b4d02aa23118fa182d1af"],"pmid":"","title":"Reliable Medical Diagnosis from Crowdsourcing: Discover Trustworthy Answers from Non-Experts","journalPages":"253-261","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~huansun/docs/trustanswer-wsdm.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018688"],"entities":["Crowdsourcing","Feature learning","Machine learning","Question answering","Scalability","Trust (emotion)","Trustworthy computing","User-generated content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2ffe1157df90ce94cb91f28074b43b58135cedac","dc79d0de2f38ca0380650cf7e7c66a87837c59ae","1c2e8d2d63312c18944c9477797e65a0975361da","7be513d138da95762d7359383101888832c3513a","5f5a54728cbcff679b5c9a915c8d72a5196403b3","1b763ec4c21c799eef00ca26f6afc6c01b45a82c","cd48760a142830b796b8a85a158cd469f3e5feb0","579e1e9217cfed6d563cedf8f8fdcd1604fc0917","4f84bcbddad1e931b0328be6e0a96ca731c538f8","2b9cd09b949b7e69933d18ae408397e803987151","4607f09a348c87f95aedd7711b24d8bf614fe58c","c80bd0821a5e1330411fa04521c2fd77e38b395e","81cdea249e937f8426a3e3a1489da736502d836f","a1fd45b3b34d1c886f249fdf57d194ccc6c480b2","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","1354ba1b6567f869065e9515a488bc031a00e25a","f94350a59508ce0175e33b3427ff0dd92ccc9abf","46dbcee23edc8385921749f6710f480440a61375","8953ebc39ec351bb7b73dc67fe238ef860b95ae9","06614ff37476c9d2cc648e2728590b361de49103","1005645c05585c2042e3410daeed638b55e2474d","113d893885b9416ecb95a18647f3719bba3b8d4f","0cd75bc954961e164818141e172820112ff4c95f","bc800d570ffb11b4f5d39156c28281f81f7100dd","0445be92e3b4867eb1e1e212c78d43c3d0c80012","a12cd3d9ae5530a90302a6e4af477e6e24fa0f95","8d67f5356ead0643940b16642a894d18b830e154","0e5ebc2eb31b6c78ee0dee10246efeeaf587f7f4","d47aeb204c9e3b879893510ac2b66883a42cf86d","1a0f8261d8384bfefbf2d561d446c3a687a5febe","3de7e6c1504e75d49b0ddeee602e9981873a7f8c","95ef74f3d40ab11163f41edaa757b71de4550a52","1a07186bc10592f0330655519ad91652125cd907","db61ce862405ca89968f43fad8aff2e8136ccb41","66b43dbeef7a13a7f1dd36ce7564e888f7196ac5"],"id":"6109a04e98efb746be96ad28a7acb7ee3d29d7ea","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6109a04e98efb746be96ad28a7acb7ee3d29d7ea","authors":[{"name":"Yaliang Li","ids":["2694924"]},{"name":"Nan Du","ids":["1714086"]},{"name":"Chaochun Liu","ids":["2633680"]},{"name":"Yusheng Xie","ids":["3052897"]},{"name":"Wei Fan","ids":["46193609"]},{"name":"Qi Li","ids":["37696683"]},{"name":"Jing Gao","ids":["49952124"]},{"name":"Huan Sun","ids":["1730401"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018688"}

This development calls for a new evaluation infrastructure that supports multi-dimensional evaluation of recommender systems. Today's researchers should analyze algorithms with respect to a variety of aspects including predictive performance and scalability. Researchers need to subject algorithms to realistic conditions in online A/B tests. We introduce two resources supporting such evaluation methodologies: the new data set of stream recommendation interactions released for CLEF NewsREEL 2017, and the new Open Recommendation Platform (ORP). The data set allows researchers to study a stream recommendation problem closely by \"replaying\" it locally, and ORP makes it possible to take this evaluation \"live\" in a living lab scenario. Specifically, ORP allows researchers to deploy their algorithms in a live stream to carry out A/B tests. To our knowledge, NewsREEL is the first online news recommender system resource to be put at the disposal of the research community. In order to encourage others to develop comparable resources for a wide range of domains, we present a list of practical lessons learned in the development of the dataset and ORP.","inCitations":["dc3f342803766ed68bf80da6ec0f380d0b59cb76","13718f4dbe3deaacc514d1952ecdaf47529bc40f"],"pmid":"","title":"A Stream-based Resource for Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of Recommender Algorithms","journalPages":"1257-1260","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://pure.tudelft.nl/portal/files/35744099/35744048.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080726"],"entities":["A/B testing","Algorithm","Interaction","Living lab","Recommender system","Scalability","Streaming media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5a729680c3f2c9ee40b4f5f3a20c24b768c0a1c9","ec76e7b8c67b47547ebc3f1f6c4edcea3d78b9dc","9f792b60ffe9f0db315d81e876c56655a419e5c2","01a199367c852d2f138de1bdadf18764dbff7eec","46ff00b1aaa2a41624181bdff3ae5cc7084d1c72","31af4b8793e93fd35e89569ccd663ae8777f0072","24cad70c8d723afd403e03fa08f49e090c4facb6","276ebc620a8976026bd2d03582b9ecfa3738d43c"],"id":"0c96f2fb180881db3a10e56194549e4c182cf7b7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0c96f2fb180881db3a10e56194549e4c182cf7b7","authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Kille","ids":["2105528"]},{"name":"Andreas Lommatzsch","ids":["47735361"]},{"name":"Frank Hopfgartner","ids":["1759761"]},{"name":"Martha Larson","ids":["1748247"]},{"name":"Arjen P. de Vries","ids":["1696923"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080726"}

One example is learning a similarity function between pairs of text, which has applications to paraphrase extraction, plagiarism detection, question answering, and ad hoc retrieval. Within the information retrieval community, the convolutional neural network model proposed by Severyn and Moschitti in a SIGIR 2015 paper has gained prominence. This paper focuses on the problem of answer selection for question answering: we attempt to replicate the results of Severyn and Moschitti using their open-source code as well as to reproduce their results via a de novo (i.e., from scratch) implementation using a completely different deep learning toolkit. Our de novo implementation is instructive in ascertaining whether reported results generalize across toolkits, each of which have their idiosyncrasies. We were able to successfully replicate and reproduce the reported results of Severyn and Moschitti, albeit with minor differences in effectiveness, but affirming the overall design of their model. Additional ablation experiments break down the components of the model to show their contributions to overall effectiveness. Interestingly, we find that removing one component actually increases effectiveness and that a simplified model with only four word overlap features performs surprisingly well, even better than convolution feature maps alone.","inCitations":["bc644dbd9f0dca18fc87f068796186a72f136f87","7b54c5bcd4f79e06b441dc650feb2cc581cd1f1e","8c0548331e02c2ead48d6c0380f9a80471ea5d80","3c3e27872d7f1a0f783c49b809a58d3ad4b8d904","10fa13117d33291d0570f00c3d09254a09afb62c","cbbf21a41b7779f64008a2720480d46223c8d615","327e62bedfa03cd6e0c7adbf224462dad13dceea","ca7dfe6d994ce56b94c51babbefc1814ac3a5b0b","84329a5ade32a3d98b03558c95c001c17e1740ae","b335cd21f8570a31319e7faa63c795340be1d3a8"],"pmid":"","title":"Experiments with Convolutional Neural Network Models for Answer Selection","journalPages":"1217-1220","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Rao_etal_SIGIR2017.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080648"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Convolution","Convolutional neural network","De novo transcriptome assembly","Deep learning","Experiment","Hoc (programming language)","Information retrieval","List of toolkits","Map","Network model","Open-source software","Overlap\u2013add method","Question answering","Self-replicating machine","Similarity measure"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["00539f3da855c8f36660f5121c280e5860fc63bb","0f6924633c56832b91836b69aedfd024681e427c","828dbeb7cf922dc9b6657dd169b8d26d2b58eedb","03feca688989940fd4a5a13ac8837403b1af5e25","3e393df4a5731fb7b49cf2f527fed1ee4e6e6942","a8ed33b244a94f032437fc6f0d7e52d5aad19133","e5d9bd94a65f3ed497a4d36e089b1393b0e5520d","68e4aedc69518d8db2f143bd3952668aa41c762c","166e449c97e50d0db3b26b5db923ffad56dd6529","828c773ec37c9f3e5e245780ba37dae7466acdd4","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","0476b7d387d2a6381a784b2b89ccf7baef098f5e","0fd0e3854ee696148e978ec33d5c042554cd4d23","515a554d001a53ba58fe5f83c6fb73556b396191","00b874f8346cedadc2a6366c4b72e60140f99556","8b1430bae27cbdb1e18b7513141233c2f9ae5849","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","343d34eec23377d6745bde10759cbfecf7a22c84"],"id":"4d7485c4837ebe75d2b94b6aa1f91e8e84f95998","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4d7485c4837ebe75d2b94b6aa1f91e8e84f95998","authors":[{"name":"Jinfeng Rao","ids":["30586030"]},{"name":"Hua He","ids":["39364450"]},{"name":"Jimmy Lin","ids":["37752900"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080648"}

We studied the characteristics of exchanging virtual goods with real money through the processes called \u201creal money trading (RMT)\u201d. This exchange might influence online game user behaviors and cause damage to the reputation of game companies. We examined ingame transactions to reveal RMT by constructing a social graph of virtual goods exchanges in an online game and identifying network communities of users. We analyzed approximately 6,000,000 transactions in a popular online game and inferred RMT transactions by comparing the RMT transactions crawled from an out-game market. Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) the size of the RMT market could be approximately estimated; (2) professional RMT providers typically form a specific network structure (either star-shape or chain) in the trading network, which can be used as a clue for tracing RMT transactions; and (3) the observed RMT market has evolved over time into a monopolized market with a small number of large-sized virtual goods providers.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"No Silk Road for Online Gamers!: Using Social Network Analysis to Unveil Black Markets in Online Games","journalPages":"1825-1834","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/44e7/05a04532f52ad82c42832535d935237eb4a3.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06368","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186177","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06368v1.pdf","https://seclab.skku.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/itsc0831-leeA.pdf"],"entities":["A* search algorithm","Bitcoin","Centralized computing","Deep web","Experiment","Internet","Lineage (evolution)","Logical volume management","Massively multiplayer online role-playing game","Server (computing)","Silk Road","Social graph","Social network analysis","Video game developer","Virtual economy","Virtual goods","Virtual world"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2f2e6b376964fb92e469b09d060ca0c60d9f6705","83f56d5165362e34ed4bc41e9e8de7cff8cea2d2","05b1724ce88bbba226f837c47c96d554d51418c3","40306b354c396bfc8381f659200194cd7a34e35a","444f0ceb312e98609914faf886f2ff0dcfebd58c","0600d4f58597767f33118ac259eb9a3be442e4e1","393da513897cc819b195223b6407414da2fef023","e833ac2e377ab0bc4a6a7f236c4b6c32f3d2b8c1","98a79269b7919cdbab0c5570e3ccee99eeedd8a3","1e4695bd5cccb8f8cc7ad8671b233b71b3a69ba0","18452937b35a289e5f2aed638e31a9ef3ee63315","d8ca1b5683eedb2600c213c0e1d81ba6dbed21a2","674d4b3409d08df6559e7daef43e1e8f462b25b5","78981127cd896e0b7bd6ecf84a24648d2ac4e2ae","4587d4722317acd4e2a90b12f58ccc9de1ecc6ee","711142335485b9e74314823fd312f6cba2b5158c","592029f9e20af564602e8a7a512d2924e999fa08","f2034a6425b921a25642fc2c41da19e365f57adb","d702b82e90233542e603f974e8a170507a9612b9","71e5a6c95ff476c303c3adeae0c1a4387485f733","f7331752c2d0de039836dc6b7e24e4ca3bb45e7c","e3967852eeb83ffb115203e27aa95964cf245b26","164f7422f2dfa481179ed34f6e180b0bb60f4174","2d1d0ee6e21c288d96577b24656cd3398082f857","9009a63ad674075dbf55e39e78213e6d90fec369","e2c5e5d1fe5ade973d5bb79c45e4e2054d4bb5c8","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","553e4daad92921dd208ec589b5fd6580eb3cc097","3ab13a23fba2f9fb59d7b438baf9177f736e3943","00b7ffd43e9b6b70c80449872a8c9ec49c7d045a"],"id":"70eca50693a8d6f4f89e48c6ba380524e69c465d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/70eca50693a8d6f4f89e48c6ba380524e69c465d","authors":[{"name":"Eunjo Lee","ids":["2090065"]},{"name":"Jiyoung Woo","ids":["5894007"]},{"name":"Hyoungshick Kim","ids":["1802864"]},{"name":"Huy Kang Kim","ids":["1802174"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186177"}

Gamification techniques can help aligning employees' motivation to the crowdsourcing endeavour. Although hitherto, research efforts were able to unravel the wide arsenal of gamification techniques to construct engagement loops, little research has shed light into the social game dynamics that those foster and how those impact crowdsourcing activities. This work reports on a study that involved 101 employees from two multinational enterprises. We adopt a user-centric approach to apply and experiment with gamification for enterprise crowdsourcing purposes. Through a qualitative study, we highlight the importance of the competitive and collaborative social dynamics within the enterprise. By engaging the employees with a mobile crowdsourcing application, we showcase the effectiveness of competitiveness towards higher levels of engagement and quality of contributions. Moreover, we underline the contradictory nature of those dynamics, which combined might lead to detrimental effects towards the engagement to crowdsourcing activities.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Social Gamification in Enterprise Crowdsourcing","journalPages":"135-144","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doc.rero.ch/record/308931/files/yan_sge.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201094"],"entities":["Crowdsourcing","Endeavour (supercomputer)","Game mechanics","Gamification","Personalization","Social dynamics"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3bf11349110a33d7d82b24e42f8bba5d97b4abc9","64acfb635d1ccd11678a5208ff14dd94522e906d","f3082c4d1f5ff99d7809c15e7a25a5cf231dac8c","e358d20a7fe90bff7ceb4579b5a67df05632ae08","4b52ad1c65b5f61fd9f7f1d040dc13d80be8d07e","176899ac1f3d4ab0b836b5f62eae511cb79a09b3","0c9c74b892695049c7c01ffabd658e8ecbbb67f6","bf56606a835de2fbc7f92b1a042cdd5a18be5804","a815df3bb9b89592e1b2a04eb7822bd1534d93d8","c0a6705f908b6875e0ed39b2e16f5a405f508dc2","59e8a0371a8cdaf24cdc3e3c0f5e7e6f2d6a1251","a2391c481bc52af028c55049310c344fee175bea","21a9f6d4f3194ad5f2ad20998a4e81d398e36874","d70c9dee74701bac83083f7ef48a17a9aa6c0c33","51933e71bfc8329115422084144afc3072bb81ef","5e747b15ef497285a2a3dda697274aed6fa8f225","7b5d41781a96d46acf34127258780299cafe3c66","f32b93e9918d7f8474e284b30ade37eaec97f416","c06d6117709a388113514b34b264ec7a1593d6f2","0768149ce1170691bcde8b4539153a282f0cc74c","e29056605bad1230b678decca3d30a7f2b3b5315","ee1b8fccb28bc805e11ac5635c5f7257c27fe49a","30248d078b584d82d82ec1194b1007316349ef43","6b4b149997b95c7db822de21b6d9277a1897b077","72dd231084d2fee5c31343b395ae372b68389ba9","a53e464fb4bc6326c217d77b38496169f7b52686","6cf8ec34a008031b018c8a3a4640a87f476d0925","ba432fb6047c4349b2daafb8938d46ad43d370a2","b6b1fcd9a0bf33a13444983fd33f7d5d196b7c99","852320e33132442e1c335b13b88be0f7afa3c080","1d8fe4710ae4ff5310ee3088823dc04ebbb361ca","a44a0462bab3134b87b2cf6f153b16352bfadd27"],"id":"6a9f3f1ba999007323de65aa3c06f49dfde76f8a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6a9f3f1ba999007323de65aa3c06f49dfde76f8a","authors":[{"name":"Gregory Afentoulidis","ids":["41127149"]},{"name":"Zoltán Szlávik","ids":["1679557"]},{"name":"Jie Yang","ids":["46478312"]},{"name":"Alessandro Bozzon","ids":["1710630"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201094"}

But the more data are available from heterogeneous sources, the higher the risk is of inconsistency. To tackle this challenge in federated knowledge bases we propose a fully automated approach for computing trust values at different levels of granularity. Gathering both the conflict graph and statistical evidence generated by inconsistency detection and resolution, we create a Markov network to facilitate the application of Gibbs sampling to compute a probability for each conflicting assertion. Based on which, trust values for each integrated data source and its respective signature elements are computed. We evaluate our approach on a large distributed dataset from the domain of library science.","inCitations":["2189351c438ed95a7584148122cfec9e59651c05"],"pmid":"","title":"Automated Fine-Grained Trust Assessment in Federated Knowledge Bases","journalPages":"490-506","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cb4a/9f4f1c9024d1b3f579443d01b029356be1d6.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_29","http://dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/lehrstuehle/ki/pub/mel/CFtrust.pdf","https://iswc2017.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/MainProceedings/119.pdf","http://videolectures.net/site/normal_dl/tag=1145358/iswc2017_nolle_knowledge_bases_01.pdf"],"entities":["Assertion (software development)","Bottom-up proteomics","Gibbs sampling","Library science","Markov chain","Markov random field","Sampling (signal processing)","Serializability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["36ada37bede2f0fd3dbab2f8d4d33df8670ff00b","487ff2a76f7859723109c2670030241593de5200","5e5c88157e4974dd7f944a2641c2385c7c6ab0f1","04f39720b9b20f8ab990228ae3fe4f473e750fe3","1c2e8d2d63312c18944c9477797e65a0975361da","2ffe1157df90ce94cb91f28074b43b58135cedac","438e50e6034517c05ceff6cc0879a0b42e728a73","4f84bcbddad1e931b0328be6e0a96ca731c538f8","46d01e53a0531e659048000e273ae0e194332204","4607f09a348c87f95aedd7711b24d8bf614fe58c","0e5ebc2eb31b6c78ee0dee10246efeeaf587f7f4","329b0e089cbe659a94a0a1fd06e71d0011498b72","4d58f3bc61a6bd91c09582e6534f46ccd84d0a9a","0ce258fc54205f6df4187fa8dbc5fc0dbbe4a734","1354ba1b6567f869065e9515a488bc031a00e25a","0dc713116d60bc65f2b69b74acbf479c3dc928f2","c9cc4712777d2e8d1f385f965b444190a5e4dca1","0d07b93cb2ee53cdfa27b116102f38c8e8b921f7","407748e97d8d3878535f6371ad324708915bf6d9","19e62aad83cd867b8b86dff15aa3fef284196597","3de7e6c1504e75d49b0ddeee602e9981873a7f8c","cc88d3ea90449023874e7d5c257a3f3644ace023","f94350a59508ce0175e33b3427ff0dd92ccc9abf"],"id":"abf5184fb72349abc0aa4eb67e80e8dcc8a751ea","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/abf5184fb72349abc0aa4eb67e80e8dcc8a751ea","authors":[{"name":"Andreas Nolle","ids":["2802106"]},{"name":"Melisachew Wudage Chekol","ids":["2077657"]},{"name":"Christian Meilicke","ids":["1795542"]},{"name":"German Nemirovski","ids":["2750942"]},{"name":"Heiner Stuckenschmidt","ids":["1698459"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_29"}

Sometimes, patients' conflicting opinions toward CAM-related issues trigger debates in the community. The objectives of this paper are to identify such debates, identify controversial CAM therapies in a popular online breast cancer community, as well as patients' stances towards them. To scale our analysis, we trained a set of classifiers. We first constructed a supervised classifier based on a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) stacked over a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect automatically CAM-related debates from a popular breast cancer forum. Members' stances in these debates were also identified by a CNN-based classifier. Finally, posts automatically flagged as debates by the classifier were analyzed to explore which specific CAM therapies trigger debates more often than others. Our methods are able to detect CAM debates with F score of 77%, and identify stances with F score of 70%. The debate classifier identified about 1/6 of all CAM-related posts as debate. About 60% of CAM-related debate posts represent the supportive stance toward CAM usage. Qualitative analysis shows that some specific therapies, such as Gerson therapy and usage of laetrile, trigger debates frequently among members of the breast cancer community. This study demonstrates that neural networks can effectively locate debates on usage and effectiveness of controversial CAM therapies, and can help make sense of patients' opinions on such issues under dispute. As to CAM for breast cancer, perceptions of their effectiveness vary among patients. Many of the specific therapies trigger debates frequently and are worth more exploration in future work.","inCitations":["9fa53f78e5654386fe38c684899dcff0b8fe9c87","07f95199b2769b2b3f94bdf4ca1b0959109cfcfb"],"pmid":"28967000v1","title":"\u201cWe make choices we think are going to save us\u201d: Debate and stance identification for online breast cancer CAM discussions","journalPages":"1073 - 1081","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6014/dccbbac110c3733154da53ac1d191bfe9903.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/noemie/papers/17www_bc.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1073.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3055134"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Biological Neural Networks","Choice Behavior","Community","Complementary and alternative medicine","Conflict (Psychology)","Convolutional neural network","F1 score","Laetrile","Long short-term memory","Machine learning","Naive Bayes classifier","Patients","Statistical classification","Therapeutic procedure"],"journalVolume":"2017","outCitations":["2b8b59a74d815a70bbb31892ce484510480be6fe","1b03f9b226a6778b42e951207f24b1bab59989b8","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","d8f9bd8c4fc1f10de358b1a2aabc06e013001fbe","9e463eefadbcd336c69270a299666e4104d50159","3f1955ec4f10de0838b1fd68195adceea7d4ee30","8cc114ff0b9266bc7166543acd77de22865c89c9","231ed1f923cd898a8f4b6b8ced873db29d67907d","43df897ba9cf412bfc9d1068e679ee5531b34d87","a51a563d5952869df5b1286be9c1008b26d1383f","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","d1a2c2b32db3d28aec2e9045fa47dee8f4c25620","268857f94994b908446d3aa74de32161c4bcf80d","a8173a796365b9a0714762a88ba497e7b2ddeb06","54dd7247a4e900a7aae90d4028dc80e5e0e6aeec","8a30668f13cb707438979f0b0a4ab43e67168a3f","cfb3e9d705ca3e18d4c2c59daf06e86dd425bde9","d7776d46c7b33956d54b1aeb7a3f595afed84172","ca99ed945e26a9354952deb9826a598ac3716024","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","10b6bfad610aaad850fd3fb0bbbd6f0bdd533274","597522738e9bfd18331bed2ad7630f433ac8f33d","033eb044ef6a865a53878397633876827b7a8f20","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","bcf2c9383317e1f07a010ac03c4fd249f19abd51","44b8c8dd33d06284e267f186a0cf6f6aa16faa9a","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","2b1b4d7832b862ca04752ec65e8362df34e185da","ad8a7f620a57478ff70045f97abc7aec9687ccbd","92d5267e6ab49083c9ea39163d6053e3e209d579","4e4ef3270abf62570db73633de0600f540229b5a","2586e5b0893324eb491912021cddc5b0cb676ec0","2350cc5e5299007330dfabdb33d335b3a9724d98","6505a2ff0003f5f8d795490145436b53dc218f64","10fe0723d1adb9611d0c4dbb43e0a5a9f7441ebb","6a13b6a8d93faaa89b583344b0160e1a58b88094","6b5e99c128b9cd7b7fbc817a2843a47ce8a1c35d","a563c058f45d7d7969e3ef57b99c9cdfdde55a14"],"id":"461a8b136e43ef34d34ec9d6bd29ea7f8a3904dc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/461a8b136e43ef34d34ec9d6bd29ea7f8a3904dc","authors":[{"name":"Shaodian Zhang","ids":["1796330"]},{"name":"Lin Qiu","ids":["1703243"]},{"name":"Frank Chen","ids":["30184502"]},{"name":"Weinan Zhang","ids":["8031058"]},{"name":"Yong Yu","ids":["1811427"]},{"name":"Noémie Elhadad","ids":["2763493"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3055134"}

Knowing why people search for images is of major concern to Web image search engines because user satisfaction may vary as intent varies. Previous analyses of image search behavior have mostly been query-based, focusing on what images people search for, rather than intent-based, that is, why people search for images. To date, there is no thorough investigation of how different image search intents affect users» search behavior. In this paper, we address the following questions: (1)Why do people search for images in text-based Web image search systems? (2)How does image search behavior change with user intent? (3)Can we predict user intent effectively from interactions during the early stages of a search session? To this end, we conduct both a lab-based user study and a commercial search log analysis. We show that user intents in image search can be grouped into three classes: Explore/Learn, Entertain, and Locate/Acquire. Our lab-based user study reveals different user behavior patterns under these three intents, such as first click time, query reformulation, dwell time and mouse movement on the result page. Based on user interaction features during the early stages of an image search session, that is, before mouse scroll, we develop an intent classifier that is able to achieve promising results for classifying intents into our three intent classes. Given that all features can be obtained online and unobtrusively, the predicted intents can provide guidance for choosing ranking methods immediately after scrolling.","inCitations":["f8c64245541a6a8a2befd94a148ac17f12170652","e4d9ee8acba167ba761efceabf58543cbd3562f5","b21999ed0fa901eb79bd1bfc42dd8e3e1e69112f","6b0ebbaea9e91d904b1923b470fbf9a49314f620"],"pmid":"","title":"Why People Search for Images using Web Search Engines","journalPages":"655-663","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09559","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09559v1.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09559","https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/27716/27716.pdf","https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/xie-why-2018.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159686"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["26ec0b0a8fae543e19c8bb8cad8fe279a70df89f","317654370830d9b20e1d78ea0489514a98ef3c56","6a229fb4bad1e4c18574046a8830f096082788dc","1454f8dce41bc7fd8148716e86e7755573404e93","f6e3bcd3ceb4e7a98832b908449623f77fe654ce","0020f7b5ff3bd39c322ae8f8f7927d116e77d322","91d8864ae01a99058e2fba34eede8c158f87a24e","016d97069dcd3b68200b2aaad86cb6306ad9e754","36f27559d12bd86d32fbe34f4b4ce7540f1686c0","3a30a54d8df929933e5e20bb7a4484f0a5a325f1","7e7343a5608fff1c68c5259db0c77b9193f1546d","229ff177dd148261bd0e8fd2541b4c3de6c2e491","857e7fce2e2f88ddb38935fa809aefa196689286","13d72ef522b405c18f7d228c5744687609b4c3a4","749d0d639c133bd329d43cb8be47f9aba2063679","6fde46fac1b310b932f212c36d2f09a85fbc8cb7","9780b60c459d118ceed53cb8809958aa98434e58","f174dbcc50436437e6bbd4139d0947138a362a7f","7a205e81af4547fa907bc3071b1e27e58a93828b","275b987cef19041cdfeecc89e509454329d2873e","5207aa1c44cb87d8356bb9142d5dfcf6adb029ca","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","017ef3a1c388824bf9abb58766b95bc9947c4c9b","d60f2e2d5a463a27b5f334a90d1feface2f264da","63add5b09e70e5f2abf970f9d315421a67379cde","ce5b0b9a74c1cbe8aa892d0ce6a731e79bff26e5","2d772cbd092d2b0869dcbfecadf70594a6d129e0","53d75fb2b745bc62fd6249116ce6b14ac05ad01e","27ae5272e7d4c260b1af931c225b5b92cbc7e26d","8302d0746edee8b7d81648861395b565589f4ec7","50261313142e7c6d07baecace1ca43c55c106fc9","d237072bae2bb7ab3c0e3ea10959c05df5384311","dea266419175e64b5b543bd3b9ef11b52243f4c8","4cc5fb6cf48b2c58b283460b19f3beeb7e5b6a22","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7","366862ca872ad9ddba0183d922be385b0ed0df1e","df6d4ee85c6a286d23c0ef11a0d6e7c4eb1a5490","4b9e993d7f4846d4750762fc0dba5b0ddadd709b","112a929962c1d95883730bfa3fcc7fe856cd21ab","ed4cbb28e02b3520252fe8089374deffc15800a6"],"id":"dc69f55ab2d2f2ce57ff84f2006baf442089d95c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dc69f55ab2d2f2ce57ff84f2006baf442089d95c","authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Xie","ids":["2834988"]},{"name":"Yiqun Liu","ids":["1783406"]},{"name":"Maarten de Rijke","ids":["1696030"]},{"name":"Jiyin He","ids":["37504156"]},{"name":"Min Zhang","ids":["38898636"]},{"name":"Shaoping Ma","ids":["8093158"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159686"}

It was recently shown that vaccination uptake can be estimated automatically from web data, instead of slowly collected clinical records or population surveys [2]. All prior work in this area assumes that features of vaccination uptake collected from the web are temporally regular. We present the first ever method to remove this assumption from vaccination uptake estimation: our method dynamically adapts to temporal fluctuations in time series web data used to estimate vaccination uptake. We show our method to outperform the state of the art compared to competitive baselines that use not only web data but also curated clinical data. This performance improvement is more pronounced for vaccines whose uptake has been irregular due to negative media attention (HPV-1 and HPV-2), problems in vaccine supply (DiTeKiPol), and targeted at children of 12 years old (whose vaccination is more irregular compared to younger children).","inCitations":["8ff7f47ef653603b6f65c128627c280ca1026dba","85c894ee27d25794d2b11bb989a611a2e5cb4fe2","c291d94dec6205ba201045a99098aa437852b3a1"],"pmid":"","title":"Time-Series Adaptive Estimation of Vaccination Uptake Using Web Search Queries","journalPages":"773-774","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ef08/93cd61959de25fbdcda41d95291489c9ae4e.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07326","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07326v1.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3041021.3054251","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p773.pdf","https://static-curis.ku.dk/portal/files/197766825/Dalum_hansen.pdf"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Floor and ceiling functions","Time series","Web search engine","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0043986792acabc899de208912d6387ca9ec1173","661d4b7b80872d4db466b503925aa1831a372649","9c630eb01b560d157530b038006cc51c44aecb03","79e8cf201c3548e0cb2462e5198bfaeff58e7aa4","3e54297883b2135091e6c67b6eaa3c66d24e7307","5cf63d82abb717c47654094e32a56d28d0dcd1e8"],"id":"0e6c743fe7c0ada8e9f4c2bfba2609500ce9d259","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0e6c743fe7c0ada8e9f4c2bfba2609500ce9d259","authors":[{"name":"Niels Dalum Hansen","ids":["3018458"]},{"name":"Kåre Mølbak","ids":["3468573"]},{"name":"Ingemar J.

To overcome this flaw, this paper investigates the interactive spatial keyword querying with semantics. It aims to enhance the conventional queries by not only making sense of the query keywords, but also refining the understanding of query semantics through interactions. On top of the probabilistic topic model, a novel interactive strategy is proposed to precisely infer the latent query semantics by learning from user feedbacks. In each interaction, the returned objects are carefully selected to ensure effective inference of user intended query semantics. Query processing is carried out on a small candidate object set at each round of interaction, and the whole querying process terminates when the latent query semantics learned from user feedback becomes explicit enough. The experimental results on real check-in dataset demonstrates that the quality of results has been significantly improved through limited number of interactions.","inCitations":["2471ff80b7251cd8ab46e267da63aa3cfb2bdb1d","44744340d011784eb2f62b0ef7d67b5fdde5ba48"],"pmid":"","title":"Interactive Spatial Keyword Querying with Semantics","journalPages":"1727-1736","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132969"],"entities":["Flaw hypothesis methodology","Interaction","Operational semantics","Quality of results","Topic model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8d840b296fbfb0ced99876205b5ffc6d761f0c66","3ca1c4c33019e9e5fe0ffc586629138550b2b168","2c28fd4850d41835e9ef08f76eff655da090f6c2","fb3f801336f60243c50018c4603833186406935f","ce27b5fc0248d235f4f5ea7d99e9169b9df298b6","c1eeaaf25d0bf81d923eb5d956c913dfdb056238","02dcad6ad979b6b7f0ebf3e79afdd03dda2e939a","5f20983c91d8fbad910c3a831b715983cd780e66","7314be5cd836c8f06bd1ecab565b00b65259eac6","421d8b62f25b95956d165250d2763335e6c02499","39b69649b828a3a752042f664c5ae35808f8dc4c","200ffb6ad03482850c6a574848fa4ed24c4175d2","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","215aad1520ec1b087ab2ba4043f5e0ecc32e7482","b19129524e29f05f27adcd2e6e33b340872f21e8","1fe33c70066cdf3904e0bf8c71107a44750e2e00","ed721bdc8b1f0f6b72b8093e0e4c4edfd47d1c03","9729a429444db46487d6a778aa5b1717a32e7879","99a4b339424b1d2eabc95b4dc9954ddc6c3702bb","27deec91511931597f5c7e0ca7841bf7c4fb70c3","411ca8dc357a451a7f6e38d8b5f586be984b4c81","29db6fac3819c85e1f0a9f29ae326ef432948a5b","dd0da551abda06e8e4bd75aafe07581190682053"],"id":"7889313435f7866b5accac2d430dae0a43e98d43","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7889313435f7866b5accac2d430dae0a43e98d43","authors":[{"name":"Jiabao Sun","ids":["1986390"]},{"name":"Jiajie Xu","ids":["3757313"]},{"name":"Kai Zheng","ids":["38671700"]},{"name":"Chengfei Liu","ids":["1706734"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132969"}

State-of-the-art OLTR methods are built specifically for linear models. Their approaches do not extend well to non-linear models such as neural networks. We introduce an entirely novel approach to OLTR that constructs a weighted differentiable pairwise loss after each interaction: Pairwise Differentiable Gradient Descent (PDGD). PDGD breaks away from the traditional approach that relies on interleaving or multileaving and extensive sampling of models to estimate gradients. Instead, its gradient is based on inferring preferences between document pairs from user clicks and can optimize any differentiable model. We prove that the gradient of PDGD is unbiased w.r.t. user document pair preferences. Our experiments on the largest publicly available Learning to Rank (LTR) datasets show considerable and significant improvements under all levels of interaction noise. PDGD outperforms existing OLTR methods both in terms of learning speed as well as final convergence. Furthermore, unlike previous OLTR methods, PDGD also allows for non-linear models to be optimized effectively. Our results show that using a neural network leads to even better performance at convergence than a linear model. In summary, PDGD is an efficient and unbiased OLTR approach that provides a better user experience than previously possible.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Differentiable Unbiased Online Learning to Rank","journalPages":"1293-1302","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271686","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1809.08415","http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08415","https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/oosterhuis-differentiable-2018.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08415v1.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Artificial neural network","Experiment","Forward error correction","Gradient descent","Interaction","Learning to rank","Linear model","Nonlinear system","Online and offline","Ranking (information retrieval)","Regret (decision theory)","Sampling (signal processing)","User (computing)","User experience"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27f7e9ff722cad915ba228dce80aa51d883c8e9f","3630af46b507fe6c42856c7ec77e1b0af3c5b7d6","aef63718ab6623199a3ff35268506b4ccfe79f42","0197775d7adc7fbaed5e39d7a13ab83661e3d506","4a8839d1b36b614b35ced8c0db42c89f6598fa6c","7c8822e4bff8eaa454a7a89bf13c443a16a85dd6","13e8086c13d25a38d704384831c1a511d1c39f61","dbcd79bd7edcdcbb5912a50796fc3c2746729eb5","1fcd20daf49f4d5ef0265690693986461a09cc04","72b2ccd702c970c588e7f3bea01e02bf0bb726ae","e12fe6934e85438cae6427f7daaaca5547183c96","13554f8fd86a75220f132f199ac5126752af8d7f","8a9f5e61c6c977cdacd85d9a7b14153026619505","d46a52c2f229efbd42f2c3d9aca301ecfb7ba2a5","f0b5bd1ea9af8582f5d7231be90092001f693236","ba1ea662bce87e8a44d85932354b8bcdba1ecc2f","035bd1607d664b0c10143ca055f1c645b7d04a11","f0b6d100b069b89b05ce543535378b626ccc577d","3bd42cfb7e633320bbeec7f6d361e92abec60b07","0a8d8cba07d165da3db5570b63905cada6dd7cf0","6ab7024ee8d08e393188a72cec6f32037905e9bc","1634bcf53de27d2ed0e4123af8d859c2fe6f0cc9","56d3374789d93575b8a5ae2c064802a2041c6041","56757c983518b0604d54719df85fcd0adf789044","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","407eb2355f698847dc7129bc1ba085376e5b3553","67f80240c59285146803d5dbff81f10047ffc288","1d81f37488a6c492d5dd2733d485c9b014e9eeb4","ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649","980e4f0f29e99024e2d858b881415a3e40de2b94","1a4580b88e9d3e3dd3dbc82b202e315169f2461d","3a53576ca90389a43209a094933c68dc3a90acff","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2","6b99b0b230eb4bb0644fd862a470285645ba9425","2e635989e232816546ef352edc38881580b04c1e","345b1d6c1a0445af12eaf195bde03a1e2ab7e6f2","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","aa0f6c1bcb50a9f5827a11de1fdccbc96c1daa0c","c16952435f6cf2d169c2c6dd6440d4554e35ae19","034641dbccaaa03f01d652a49ea68310e2c9d5d3"],"id":"d0bcc2a82b7f77372f1aaf0138a4862c51115fbd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d0bcc2a82b7f77372f1aaf0138a4862c51115fbd","authors":[{"name":"Harrie Oosterhuis","ids":["37910069"]},{"name":"Maarten de Rijke","ids":["1696030"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271686"}

Despite detailed posting guidelines, duplicate questions that have been answered are frequently created. To tackle this problem, Stack Overflow provides a mechanism for reputable users to manually mark duplicate questions. This is a laborious effort, and leads to many duplicate questions remain undetected. Existing duplicate detection methodologies from traditional community based question-answering (CQA) websites are difficult to be adopted directly to PCQA, as PCQA posts often contain source code which is linguistically very different from natural languages. In this paper, we propose a methodology designed for the PCQA domain to detect duplicate questions. We model the detection as a classification problem over question pairs. To extract features for question pairs, our methodology leverages continuous word vectors from the deep learning literature, topic model features and phrases pairs that co-occur frequently in duplicate questions mined using machine translation systems. These features capture semantic similarities between questions and produce a strong performance for duplicate detection. Experiments on a range of real-world datasets demonstrate that our method works very well; in some cases over 30% improvement compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks. As a product of one of the proposed features, the association score feature, we have mined a set of associated phrases from duplicate questions on Stack Overflow and open the dataset to the public.","inCitations":["4e210f80135c9bf257610b49cd46e9f131baba60","5791bfd8980219eb71137ea2fdc1e14f01802f91","b3595bdb8ccdf31f19c057ad1614db0b392b9cd4","d8f7f63244a7fdc20c8b508040c23a82f6a5c0c0","1a6c57fc372a85ea54dcd04e26cf10af219a4c04","96d819c115cfd0a16372942ce28b80a890203665","c435b4fa6c642dfc273d646bb6ac1621c44fc163","bc644dbd9f0dca18fc87f068796186a72f136f87","2618d4af1fef88c4f8e3a3b145e97aa36234f6de"],"pmid":"","title":"Detecting Duplicate Posts in Programming QA Communities via Latent Semantics and Association Rules","journalPages":"1221-1229","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/68e4/7fea6d61acbf0b058a963e42228a4e3f07af.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1221.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3038912.3052701"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Deep learning","Machine translation","MinEd","Natural language","Programmer","Question answering","Software quality assurance","Stack Overflow","Topic model","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d87ceda3042f781c341ac17109d1e94a717f5f60","24c223b3ee1b3198a021a2dcbf437136c80442ae","b3625e35fe7de551d628dd4b3875d2ba847f1097","9ac8ba7b5d78c8a8764a3064e59a0017b440991d","17ba9019ec7eb1f03d64f4d80e47376a4f6f8583","3ebf06af29f7a158778eb1c6908d7ac37f16668b","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","c83b13d9784de17926e251d9c6a6e60deb017cdc","10ab45df501d7900fe560d8ae57f0287af695998","0a17a81e2e738707836005b62447f12383ddb6ac","40eb9fb2dc89e2de7762ef5d5d77741fba571459","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","22272f8b59ebbac76fb53a71d76b5f1dc113d1fe","3b8e7c8220d3883d54960d896a73045f3c70ac17","8ac71a7aaa808f2e339fd0e7949c8c0b26feafa7","6355c8062a704ebd28e0315a6211a2d55373d05a","0ef7d9e618cbb507d69f8ebcdc60b8a1f3135bff","368f3dea4f12c77dfc9b7203f3ab2b9efaecb635","99607beb60ea3280c3945a8ecd1578a692de5ff6","b41d0fa5fdaadd47fc882d3db04277d03fb21832","36df8d7a778489d565715f273b82ea82acb71b2f","08743d09f3ec33ab1f188d4c5f8f5550c312ace0","e7bd00118441665dece85ad3cc9b7113a5abc605","097665e66a05d316ad0e649fec374db44a485bda","4b5ffc1adb22fcc29ac31a6a2779c5448c3d4ed3","0e2795b1329b25ba3709584b96fd5cb4c96f6f22","40ccca414291f5585fefb22cb9d3e841ef63fc27","574dfd4bbd7f57c5a3ea333913b7b3f9a816d9fd","0f32cd9cf29ec55b9a54dd5a4adf80b03e0ac08d"],"id":"68e47fea6d61acbf0b058a963e42228a4e3f07af","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/68e47fea6d61acbf0b058a963e42228a4e3f07af","authors":[{"name":"Wei Emma Zhang","ids":["32794831"]},{"name":"Quan Z.

Traditional click models aim to extract the \u2039query, document\u203a relevance and the estimated bias is usually discarded after relevance is extracted. In contrast, the most recent work on unbiased learning-to-rank can effectively leverage the bias and thus focuses on estimating bias rather than relevance [20, 31]. Existing approaches use search result randomization over a small percentage of production traffic to estimate the position bias. This is not desired because result randomization can negatively impact users' search experience. In this paper, we compare different schemes for result randomization (i.e., RandTopN and RandPair) and show their negative effect in personal search. Then we study how to infer such bias from regular click data without relying on randomization. We propose a regression-based Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that is based on a position bias click model and that can handle highly sparse clicks in personal search. We evaluate our EM algorithm and the extracted bias in the learning-to-rank setting. Our results show that it is promising to extract position bias from regular clicks without result randomization. The extracted bias can improve the learning-to-rank algorithms significantly. In addition, we compare the pointwise and pairwise learning-to-rank models. Our results show that pairwise models are more effective in leveraging the estimated bias.","inCitations":["e301275b5924494b43bff0f931baa324fddc1a0c","b286e2164f51daf7e39613583c79c3e45cd422ae","3f26b7932ff73610e1fc2c5def42cf873a0e096b","fe7d8d3e703dc653b32f1644c8f636cad32a8752","42d0627e231272ecba2957b8b4042c5a4b0c8ddf","332dd8f3f2d11b49246bbe1cc6efd9f50fa73134","ec445094084b368770bc05686e70fa615fc92db2","5bf3c6fe470c799bcc935226c19104cdb76ecb8e","600a6370fb124824814470a7f189020d9fe417a9","c87a934d55ca746caefeffa91dc281a4eec98608","10cdb2f8943e2589673818e7f4d630464de94553","de411ccc884f55a8527db7dbd232955a2826d397","ad41a81e52f70d56fb0a7526a0a35ad972b49d94","418383a9baec58d1232bebde205f28e730d26570","f86e212ec5f6463cbc48f144d59e68b89e47d13a","4fcdf84f55b5db5cd08210e4943740b0a84362aa"],"pmid":"","title":"Position Bias Estimation for Unbiased Learning to Rank in Personal Search","journalPages":"610-618","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159732","https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46485.pdf"],"entities":["Clickstream","Consistency model","Email","Expectation\u2013maximization algorithm","Learning to rank","Online advertising","Randomized algorithm","Relevance","Sparse matrix","Web Services Distributed Management"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2ff7249aa7221f93b81268dda63b9d2939c37883","505253630ab7e8f35e26e27904bd3c8faea3c5ce","6e953a5caa643ef2e310473b680ef23262bb80ce","ba1ea662bce87e8a44d85932354b8bcdba1ecc2f","815571978a3b21f65fa1ef2bb7a917a239a6159c","8a77d1025c2dc9669d04b3865a9cbd2ff8b526a6","77cba94ab304b82ede59ae32b7ed1ea90d2ad7c7","01f72ed3b6ddbd006e2f83bd7f60d83a279e693d","47c2612162027cdc3c9bfa10a32a9174cc5628bf","582ea307db25c5764e7d2ed82c4846757f4e95d7","10ceb668f84860bb09fca364125cae4b1ee2e760","f0b5bd1ea9af8582f5d7231be90092001f693236","ea5d5e8c9a73d317bcca27714b2eaaf7a0463c21","4752e8858dd67002b16b281e115655307ec3c974","13d72ef522b405c18f7d228c5744687609b4c3a4","374bf28854c23561976fc6a2b5abd4b9f7f117ba","46cb32eec63d625e32c0ce99744c4c256a9a13fa","79bb159199cf0e3bd2a501a8052c233290e53c05","756e05876940c3ac29d8eb138382987df8486e18","56efce392172f53b71cfc3daf09db983629b60a5","26e8f3cc46b710a013358bf0289df4de033446ba","29ee4fd0a7bee62d2fe8df5ce7bc37dd1ffed688","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","f788be99489fe49d599ea06b225e32c6f812b973","04c38643946c9acbb7f2b213e453aa14d17611e4","e414228a3b1a5d0079f880246b7421a36c9e858a","44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e","20a8a98c3f250f61a622ed4cf207c851e8d8fb3d","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2","15e7c55afea2c82b34d42e374fe4f9fccd24f998","5d06b0b24f42fa7f48b01267458baf5e6e7e9fc0","1a101cb8adad86a076a8e7686b513fa3395a0e5a","6b99b0b230eb4bb0644fd862a470285645ba9425","3832b5bbb8d751da15cdfa466f85cfc684b16580"],"id":"c9359c13b4f4b058380e4ea3387044012e65bd2a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9359c13b4f4b058380e4ea3387044012e65bd2a","authors":[{"name":"Xuanhui Wang","ids":["1734449"]},{"name":"Nadav Golbandi","ids":["3254779"]},{"name":"Michael Bendersky","ids":["1815447"]},{"name":"Donald Metzler","ids":["1680617"]},{"name":"Marc Najork","ids":["1763978"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159732"}

Existing methods encompass two general approaches. The first approach searches for these unknown connections by examining the textual contents of research papers. In addition to the existing textual features, the second approach incorporates structural features of scientific literatures, such as citation structures. These approaches, however, have not considered research papersâ\u0080\u0099 latent bibliographic metadata structures as important features that can be used for predicting previously unknown relationships between them\n This thesis investigates a new graph-based LBD method that exploits the latent bibliographic metadata connections between pairs of research papers. The heterogeneous bibliographic information network is proposed as an efficient graph-based data structure for modeling the complex relationships between these metadata. In contrast to previous approaches, this method seamlessly combines textual and citation information in the form of path-based metadata features for predicting future co-citation links between research papers from disparate research fields. The results reported in this thesis provide evidence that the method is effective for reconstructing the historical literature-based discovery hypotheses\n This thesis also investigates the effects of semantic modeling and topic modeling on the performance of the proposed method. For semantic modeling, a general-purpose word sense disambiguation technique is proposed to reduce the lexical ambiguity in the title and abstract of research papers. The experimental results suggest that the reduced lexical ambiguity did not necessarily lead to a better performance of the method. This thesis discusses some of the possible contributing factors to these results.\n Finally, topic modeling is used for learning the latent topical relations between research papers. The learned topic model is incorporated into the heterogeneous bibliographic information network graph and allows new predictive features to be learned. The results in this thesis suggest that topic modeling improves the performance of the proposed method by increasing the overall accuracy for predicting the future co-citation links between disparate research papers.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Literature-Based Discovery by Learning Heterogeneous Bibliographic Information Networks","journalPages":"75-76","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3130332.3130347","http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/p075.pdf"],"entities":["Co-citation","Data structure","General-purpose modeling","Topic model","Word sense","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"51","outCitations":[],"id":"c130efe4944b4f375baa730ff852846fa49e869d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c130efe4944b4f375baa730ff852846fa49e869d","authors":[{"name":"Yakub Sebastian","ids":["34655507"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3130332.3130347"}

These machine learning computations constitute a substantial part of the operating cost, e.g., 10% to 30% of the total gross revenues. It is desirable to cache and reuse previous computation results to reduce this cost, but caching introduces approximation which comes with potential revenue loss. To maximize cost savings while minimizing the overall revenue impact, an intelligent refresh policy is required to decide when to refresh the cached computation results. The state-of-the-art manually-tuned refresh heuristic uses revenue history to assign different refresh frequencies. Using the gradient boosting regression tree algorithm with well selected features, we introduce a rapid prediction framework that provides refresh decisions at higher accuracy compared to the heuristic. This enables us to build a prediction-based refresh policy and a cache achieving higher profit without manual parameter tuning. Simulations conducted on the logs from a major commercial search advertising system show that our proposed cache design reduces the negative revenue impact (0.07×), and improves the cost savings (1.41×) and the net profit (1.50∼1.70×) compared to the state-of-the-art manually-tuned heuristic-based cache design.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Better Caching in Search Advertising Systems with Rapid Refresh Predictions","journalPages":"1875-1884","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/193e/fb515e1eef8bcbbb9a452a4d7fd247252ecf.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~conglonl/adscache-www2018.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186176"],"entities":["Algorithm","Approximation","Cache (computing)","Computation","Computer simulation","Decision tree learning","Feature selection","Gradient boosting","Heuristic","Heuristic (computer science)","List of algorithms","Machine learning","Rapid Refresh","Search advertising","Tracing (software)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["668b7370d15381c4efe2445415fb806605741dd0","0a1c762e3565a02a7305774703872dc170ec00ca","416acb90be46d03f7402954dddde545a2891cfa0","da2b9f56a556030ea0c709f5cbc79b25abf38582","00ab6bb0df7fd605038d64eb5798b31481a39dd0","8a732568ee5590e38afebaf7d94963e82a026bf7","95dddaae82aac40aab010c1778f647538e4b4aa4","635c67d342ac2c2e26c5338d8dac115cde289828","221b42bb9b7fb5fb54ed22c22f9f025a1aed74aa","3ac21dd513a91d4535a0e6d4e52555657d788b9b","677bae0a827e910fc38ec6632aa5b1e6ea837a8d","7f7d58dd3163389470e67a1ffd4da45bb6f3f398","c4a317a205429dc826034a17a869f98ba407aea0","1ff88585ce3fd5fdaab6573722d4874641359951","2246eb11d3a82058459072d26d652143647ef58f","2ecc74f8662bb3455bbfec2f82f01ab3b17743eb","daf9ed5dc6c6bad5367d7fd8561527da30e9b8dd","ed31c96f2b2a3f17982e1b7df90cc162940fade4","1b1ea9f3f15f5160b77aa2177e7fdeb6eeed911a","582ea307db25c5764e7d2ed82c4846757f4e95d7"],"id":"193efb515e1eef8bcbbb9a452a4d7fd247252ecf","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/193efb515e1eef8bcbbb9a452a4d7fd247252ecf","authors":[{"name":"Conglong Li","ids":["2609325"]},{"name":"David G.

A fair amount of user queries seek information on problem-solving tasks such as building a fence or repairing a bicycle. However, knowledge graphs completely lack this kind of how-to knowledge. This paper presents a method for automatically constructing a formal knowledge base on tasks and task-solving steps, by tapping the contents of online communities such as WikiHow. We employ Open-IE techniques to extract noisy candidates for tasks, steps and the required tools and other items. For cleaning and properly organizing this data, we devise embedding-based clustering techniques.

High performance query processing is fundamental for the success of such systems. In fact, web search engines can receive billions of queries per day. Additionally, the issuing users are often impatient and expect sub-second response times to their queries (e.g., 500 ms). For such reasons, search companies adopt distributed query processing strategies to cope with huge volumes of incoming queries and to provide sub-second response times. Web search engines perform distributed query processing on computer clusters composed by thousands of computers and hosted in large data centers. While data center facilities enable large-scale online services, they also raise economical and environmental concerns. Therefore, an important problem to address is how to reduce the energy expenditure of data centers. Moreover, another problem to tackle is how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the negative impact of the data centers on the environment. A large part of the energy consumption of a data center could be accounted to inefficiencies in its cooling and power supply systems. However, search companies already adopt state-of-the art techniques to reduce the energy wastage of such systems, leaving little room for more improvements in those areas. Therefore, new approaches are necessary to mitigate the environmental impact and the energy expenditure of web search engines. One option is to reduce the energy consumption of computing resources to mitigate the energy expenditure and carbon footprint of a search company. In particular, reducing the energy consumption of CPUs represents an attractive venue for web search engines. Currently, CPU cores frequencies are typically managed by operating system components, called frequency governors. We propose to delegate the CPU power management from the OS frequency governors to the query processing application [2]. Such search engine-specific governors can reduce up to 24% a server power consumption, with only limited (but uncontrollable) drawbacks in the quality of search results with respect to a system running at maximum CPU frequency. Since users can hardly notice response times that are faster than their expectations we advise that web search engine should not process queries faster than user expectations and, consequently, we propose the Predictive Energy Saving Online Scheduling (PESOS) algorithm, to select the most appropriate CPU frequency to process a query by its deadline, on a per-core basis [3]. PESOS can reduce the CPU energy consumption of a query processing server from 24% up to 48% when compared to a high performance system running at maximum CPU core frequency. To reduce the carbon footprint of web search engines, another option consists in using green energy to partially power their data centers. Stemming from these observations, we propose a new query forwarding algorithm that exploits both the green energy sources available at different data centers and the differences in market energy prices [1]. The proposed solution maintains a high query throughput, while reducing by up to 25% the energy operational costs of multi-center search engines.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Energy Efficiency in Large Scale Information Retrieval Systems","journalPages":"159-160","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3190580.3190605","http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/p159.pdf"],"entities":["Accessibility","Algorithm","Central processing unit","Clock rate","Computer cluster","Computer cooling","Data center","Database","E-services","Freedom of information laws by country","Information retrieval","Operating system","Power management","Power supply","Query throughput","Scheduling (computing)","Server (computing)","Stemming","Venue (sound system)","Web search engine","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"51","outCitations":["20395fc0489a44ecd46c2825666b49c5c985aea7","d75b5ee0ab2adaceffa28054ed994b047d3c69a4","982363c9a166d9aa2b2ad9ab00b75102cef4082b"],"id":"fba9b31569ba7ec7a059c1e0444954de4f112868","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba9b31569ba7ec7a059c1e0444954de4f112868","authors":[{"name":"Matteo Catena","ids":["2748759"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3190580.3190605"}

In this paper, we aim to estimate the wireless coverage of an area based on the randomly distributed samples of received signal strength collected within the area. Specifically, we propose a weakly-supervised generative adversarial nets with auxiliary information (WS-GAN), which is a data-driven model to make estimation on the wireless coverage. Different from conventional methods (e.g., k-NN) that predict the missing values by simply replacing them with the average of nearby observations, WS-GAN adopts a GAN-based structure, in which the generator approximates the real distribution of observations under the supervision of the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to distinguish the ground truth from \"faked\" data produced by the generator. WS-GAN differs from the literature in two aspects: (1) WS-GAN is able to use the auxiliary information of local radio environment, e.g., geographical information as terrain and buildings, to improve the estimation performance, since such auxiliary information has significant impact on the variation of received signal strength. (2) The objective function of WS-GAN combines adversarial loss and a new light-weight reconstruction error term for weakly supervision, which are jointly optimized during training. The experiments on a real dataset show that WS-GAN can generally achieve more accurate results than baselines. Moreover, through a case study, we demonstrate that the wireless coverage maps generated by WS-GAN are more rational and practical than those obtained by baselines.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Weakly-Supervised Generative Adversarial Nets with Auxiliary Information for Wireless Coverage Estimation","journalPages":"1851-1854","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269294"],"entities":["Discriminator","Display resolution","Experiment","Ground truth","K-nearest neighbors algorithm","Loss function","Map","Minimax","Missing data","Optimization problem","Randomness","WS-Federation","Wireless router"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6f5b6b6e94dca127afe5c6effa62a4c6771640d8","35756f711a97166df11202ebe46820a36704ae77","f1db5828c2f5eb3d7e9b9ad15eb73f6ae53fbe05","023f6fc69fe1f6498e35dbf85932ecb549d36ca4","0bbc35bdbd643fb520ce349bdd486ef2c490f1fc","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","6de2b1058c5b717878cce4e7e50d3a372cc4aaa6","31c67f575b468fa760b64abbe852b81a0abf14c5","187480101af3fb195993da1e2c17d917df24eb23","446fbff6a2a7c9989b0a0465f960e236d9a5e886","ba753286b9e2f32c5d5a7df08571262e257d2e53","8a3bf4d403a39ed33f0fa8cf78dc906d6130595f","bd36544bfecd5b9ea58d0eab186968b3c9d181aa"],"id":"7c00f4882f145c599fd737f9c6085c172927d510","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7c00f4882f145c599fd737f9c6085c172927d510","authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Li","ids":["46948015"]},{"name":"Hongwei Wang","ids":["48016057"]},{"name":"Miao Zhao","ids":["48886436"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269294"}

Deep learning has revolutionized many research fields and there is a recent surge of interest in applying it to collaborative filtering (CF). However, existing methods compose deep learning architectures with the latent factor model ignoring a major class of CF models, neighborhood or memory-based approaches. We propose Collaborative Memory Networks (CMN), a deep architecture to unify the two classes of CF models capitalizing on the strengths of the global structure of latent factor model and local neighborhood-based structure in a nonlinear fashion. Motivated by the success of Memory Networks, we fuse a memory component and neural attention mechanism as the neighborhood component. The associative addressing scheme with the user and item memories in the memory module encodes complex user-item relations coupled with the neural attention mechanism to learn a user-item specific neighborhood. Finally, the output module jointly exploits the neighborhood with the user and item memories to produce the ranking score. Stacking multiple memory modules together yield deeper architectures capturing increasingly complex user-item relations. Furthermore, we show strong connections between CMN components, memory networks and the three classes of CF models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMN on three public datasets outperforming competitive baselines. Qualitative visualization of the attention weights provide insight into the model's recommendation process and suggest the presence of higher order interactions.","inCitations":["dd65b918ba7ce2728c2c8f10168814e0d66d7d86","f0d7ee59de345c8d0ed3c265a3bc9c54a1e7e4d3"],"pmid":"","title":"Collaborative Memory Network for Recommendation Systems","journalPages":"515-524","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209991","http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10862","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10862v2.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10862"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b2624c3cb508bf053e620a090332abce904099a1","6a94f16627379a7163f39a5b909c41b5167d3889","15f5721502c2905c555a4eb0a110d6fc211c1fb2","9e91c370a8fae365c731947ad9178fb3788f6593","cd7f63705b45ef2f66e9b41462a36901450c9d51","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","f0af0029293dc8f242894f113baf15d68228ec4d","081ad92ce0e71541646218f11061c86414a960c2","fe298e05c0e3a0de1bc47c6d59595cb5fbd8e6f5","2ef7d506b25731d0f3ec0c8f90b718b6e5bbd069","0c0ff60e9d39c203929457d1ac3f840f8c8e9619","4f6e61d2ab1e2f468cc4bc8fdd8d6f13efaba468","859e3afc4b8e7662a6bf29723863e9d5ca14d14c","82a19668cbe51e0ed6396dc3ab178932bdd8408f","098c57f75479813c2cdc848ab16ef41d87353702","5324ba064dc1656dd51c04122c2c802ef9ec28ce","733965e4eab52c25af641919e3c9481b1cddfd09","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","04850809e4e31437039833753226b440a4fc8864","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","714544b7cf35a3b8bdc12fb1967624a38f257a42","bf9ca74b5b82e9679383e0d1e9e4ae9b14b68b99","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","4672f24bf1828452dc367669ab8a29f79834ad58","24f1a3ec9d02abcd3b5ed7f511b9d8017213954a","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","3b0c39b323a8cc1a90b3fdee83dad2fd417bd0ce","ece016d98b66d21489169cc4c7bbb5973d658e79","04ee77ef1143af8b19f71c63b8c5b077c5387855","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","067faa8ec03587537c568418c9d05334a7624212","873c4035268fb41f36555cd9f4b90423c174dae9","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","3ba179bceb9692d4d21109d0b87b120195761148","7656cddac460af91919558175063938acfdd813b","784ee73d5363c711118f784428d1ab89f019daa5"],"id":"5872b41cbb4f8b920bc9286a4fcd10385ddd353b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5872b41cbb4f8b920bc9286a4fcd10385ddd353b","authors":[{"name":"Travis Ebesu","ids":["9701534"]},{"name":"Bin Shen","ids":["48113851"]},{"name":"Yi Fang","ids":["48802863"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3209991"}

We believe that certain kterms are more important than others and hypothesize that uniform kterm weights are sub-optimal for determining novelty in data streams. To validate our hypothesis, we parameterize Kterm Hashing by assigning weights to kterms based on their characteristics. Our experiments apply Kterm Hashing in a First Story Detection setting and reveal that parameterized Kterm Hashing can surpass state-of-the-art detection accuracy and significantly outperform the uniformly weighted approach.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Parameterizing Kterm Hashing","journalPages":"945-948","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210101"],"entities":["Cryptographic hash function","Experiment","Image scaling","Locality-sensitive hashing","Novelty detection"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8608a48f6a5850259afb036b70fd289b4c174cc6","e269f185514a8117ad382c26099fea179055c9cf","a718b85520bea702533ca9a5954c33576fd162b0","9c42cd61d4290fed4597041a880b4f8c92673b03","1faaf2f951ea62cfb5d30b00a19ad466ea1403ad","2986b7f25c0ec5d5e3fc49a78629f0216fe1da9d","48c9f048684c0f1ad472c2789136ed977f671565","2599131a4bc2fa957338732a37c744cfe3e17b24","e97f4042e0fa7287064e312c08d094c8e5871b97","d4a4478e60466edfe5d3300f404eecec390e8ad1","3593269a4bf87a7d0f7aba639a50bc74cb288fb1","21922f216002ed2bc44b886b5e8e3042da45c40c","a33373331a25e2f2ac015d9354330af42950ab5d","bd2fee71f1b7b92bca099b7d013f6a90a9f701b3","7c2cb0272af5817cd58fb1707d6e5833c851d72b","f3edecc94025ba1024214d8e0f25f093b647a8ee","3d24f664878f86d8b594db90299a5c381fa18449","7e43ec7ef23547dbb042768de7b77a714fc351ac","5e86ea7cfcc3a443f07ddabe8a70b2815f87552e","1dc841887e26e868bb367a4b67f83f36938a80f9","58c3b615df1814feeabb721af50291f0519a0734"],"id":"5758befca8168f5b9c2ef3ff7c731226d60f2cc7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5758befca8168f5b9c2ef3ff7c731226d60f2cc7","authors":[{"name":"Dominik Wurzer","ids":["2017338"]},{"name":"Yumeng Qin","ids":["7595645"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210101"}

Existing works for cyberbullying detection have at least one of the following three bottlenecks. First, they target only one particular social media platform (SMP). Second, they address just one topic of cyberbullying. Third, they rely on carefully handcrafted features of the data. We show that deep learning based models can overcome all three bottlenecks. Knowledge learned by these models on one dataset can be transferred to other datasets. We performed extensive experiments using three real-world datasets: Formspring ( ̃12k posts), Twitter ( ̃16k posts), and Wikipedia( ̃100k posts). Our experiments provide several useful insights about cyberbullying detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically analyzes cyberbullying detection on various topics across multiple SMPs using deep learning based models and transfer learning.","inCitations":["1222f49eff14f58de0b69ea150721489917ce810","57634d2399564b9457fd401c187cb77db376750c","e966f4ff0467d51cded139bf3b407bd9d3122810","78048583b862a54dedcee117e50be7c94b40cf08","bed74814efd2e59ef91c550b3e20e87214e70c19","1a496e6ea433fa31abbb4dc89c00dfede0467510"],"pmid":"","title":"Deep Learning for Detecting Cyberbullying Across Multiple Social Media Platforms","journalPages":"141-153","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/32b3/5252693f859e55a8a7945cf8947bfca7c867.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06482","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06482v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_11"],"entities":["Cyberbullying","Deep learning","Experiment","Multimedia framework","Sensor","Social graph","Social media","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7a3116377b5654dc1f8362dee85b7845f07b5850","670c26b6740c307b0fc1bf4ea1421af2ba636daa","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","df704cca917666dace4e42b4d3a50f65597b8f06","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","4a7204431900338877c738c8f56b10a71a52e064","27ee75e2047bac3ae9fc3b4f09aa610d14104f5c","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","3208b5abafa1146e7df1073090523c822909275e","87e5931dee6988d95e950837c27a5d59c2536b40","e39b586e561b36a3b71fa3d9ee7cb15c35d84203","59e65c8cec7098be79b5d95a98fc7a9db6be369a","812183caa91bab9c2729de916ee3789b68023f39","c9948f7213167d65db79b60381d01ea71d438f94","b5d67aee50f0ea07d23b35dce0c57280b7fe5067"],"id":"32b35252693f859e55a8a7945cf8947bfca7c867","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/32b35252693f859e55a8a7945cf8947bfca7c867","authors":[{"name":"Sweta Agrawal","ids":["5112699"]},{"name":"Amit Awekar","ids":["1702207"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_11"}

Along with the increasing variety of data sources, many datasets are also equipped with certain side information of heterogeneous structure. Such side information can be critical for feature selection when class labels are unavailable. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection method, SideFS, to exploit such rich side information. We model the complex side information as a heterogeneous network and derive instance correlations to guide subsequent feature selection. Representations are learned from the side information network and the feature selection is performed in a unified framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively enhance the quality of selected features by incorporating heterogeneous side information.","inCitations":["0fb9dd1edb873e445a1413165b617f98bd6ddb42","3ea58938299dd6304e9b8648b172fedaccafa2f5"],"pmid":"","title":"Unsupervised Feature Selection with Heterogeneous Side Information","journalPages":"2359-2362","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://www.cs.uic.edu/~bcao1/doc/cikm17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133055"],"entities":["Feature selection","Unified Framework"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002","1257236ec8b7a21afe7305abac0e6b0cafc3752f","e9cff4396697236d88d2107802e2718bdd09b5a3","c14ef7b146b13086159c5ce104db046a27b3e21c","a675cef5b434619a71ec2a30ac63d108f3d98a63","00ac342723beabdd5216779b7674d49649d41842","92ce772a452f2d9b06b8491db013c9dc107ca2cf","8117433f035c9254e37d316d7b57b1580cff8c5e","0fc2dcc4d56bd76e892d24f1121a8824e0deae8c","03ce9b83f0b5fe98e5795a909bbf2ef35af0cbf3","a47adcc6f6428a57bcbdc1d98b9a20cd7d75e0b2","20dc1890ca65e01856f31edf10126c2ad67e9d04","0e73710441b636c8d3c44f5cd5501ca0d149ff48","521120c3907677e17708c17c5b6bab9087e61c5b","5099057404a78157e80135a6ba4f9db523ab9fa3","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8"],"id":"7d295804f58733c15c6640c6f12f15e42f5eb3db","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7d295804f58733c15c6640c6f12f15e42f5eb3db","authors":[{"name":"Xiaokai Wei","ids":["2336542"]},{"name":"Bokai Cao","ids":["1678185"]},{"name":"Philip S.

It is used by marketers and brands to reach their potential audience for advertisement. The number of likes on posts serves as a proxy for social reputation of the users, and in some cases, social media influencers with an extensive reach are compensated by marketers to promote products. This emerging market has led to users artificially bolstering the likes they get to project an inflated social worth. In this study, we enumerate the potential factors which contribute towards a genuine like on Instagram.

One way to differentiate machine learning tasks is by the following two factors: (1) How much noise is contained in the data? and (2) How far into the future is the prediction task? The former presents a limit to the learnability of task --- regardless which learning algorithm is used --- whereas the latter has a crucial implication on the representation of the predictions: while most tasks in search and advertising typically only forecast minutes into the future, tasks in e-commerce can require predictions up to a year into the future. The further the forecast horizon, the more important it is to take account of uncertainty in both the learning algorithm and the representation of the predictions. I will discuss which learning frameworks are best suited for the various scenarios, that is, short-term predictions with little noise vs. long-term predictions with lots of noise, and present some ideas to combine representation learning with probabilistic methods.\n In the second half of the talk, I will give an overview of the applications of machine learning at Amazon ranging from demand forecasting, machine translation to automation of computer vision tasks and robotics. I will also discuss the importance of tools for data scientist and share learnings on bringing machine learning algorithms into products.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Machine Learning at Amazon","journalPages":"535","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3022764"],"entities":["Algorithm","Computer vision","Data science","E-commerce","Learnability","Machine learning","Machine translation","Robotics"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"08f12b563e985b0413dc018665a5b0155692a258","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/08f12b563e985b0413dc018665a5b0155692a258","authors":[{"name":"Ralf Herbrich","ids":["3234984"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3022764"}

If one seeks to build a collection of stories about local events, the national news media may be insufficient, with the exception of local news which \"bubbles\" up to the national news media. If we rely exclusively on national media, or build collections exclusively on their reports, we could be late to the important milestones which precipitate major local events, thus, run the risk of losing important stories due to link rot and content drift. Consequently, it is important to consult local sources affected by local events. Our goal is to provide a suite of tools (beginning with two) under the umbrella of the Local Memory Project (LMP) to help users and small communities discover, collect, build, archive, and share collections of stories for important local events by leveraging local news sources. The first service (Geo) returns a list of local news sources (newspaper, TV and radio stations) in order of proximity to a user-supplied zip code. The second service (Local Stories Collection Generator) discovers, collects and archives a collection of news stories about a story or event represented by a user-supplied query and zip code pair. We evaluated 20 pairs of collections, Local (generated by our system) and non-Local, by measuring archival coverage, tweet index rate, temporal range, precision, and sub-collection overlap. Our experimental results showed Local and non-Local collections with archive rates of 0.63 and 0.83, respectively, and tweet index rates of 0.59 and 0.80, respectively. Local collections produced older stories than non-Local collections, at a higher precision (relevance) of 0.84 compared to a non-Local precision of 0.72. These results indicate that Local collections are less exposed, thus less popular than their non-Local counterpart.","inCitations":["3d51ad6d4031dfe3b5100ef71ff9fb6fb4580b9a","08d9009a2b2f6f6475de6b87eaf330a1f885fab1","4294a07be5e6b1f83b5cdf6be9e91d9643fe498a"],"pmid":"","title":"Local Memory Project: Providing Tools to Build Collections of Stories for Local Events from Local Sources","journalPages":"1-10","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.odu.edu/~anwala/files/publications/NwalaJCDL_LMP.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3200358"],"entities":["Archive","Information retrieval","Link rot","Nv network","Radio broadcasting","Relevance","Social media","Software rot"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ae3f2a5d69e31b1a97f7b5e1aff90a5c05abf250","6876cd49ff90161e5ad6413fe3aa96dcf93d05b6","4162e88d17442aaf347f160374adfdf732be26b3","33f0b851c51aba804e25c8b121c56ba8b585ca9d","1908512f4bbdee0828541cec9a81081442ac21c2","a49b9ea3a80bad7080a1e29dd7af317153d0e747","fb618aa2921a6026c93cbd95d5cad96afa1da372","554245e0b95451d26ec7afd4afae9893031c051f","2adfb3663ddb9389dfa0ed78ccbb0b2ffbad99d6","0874b86c9ba73d0f6c23eb0d33324733506a5243"],"id":"d0e55cd90e083cdb6b2c3987042bdf88a2472011","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d0e55cd90e083cdb6b2c3987042bdf88a2472011","authors":[{"name":"Alexander C.

Quality control is an important issue in crowdsourcing, which has been extensively addressed by existing quality-control algorithms, e.g., voting-based algorithms and probabilistic graphical models. However, these algorithms cannot ensure quality under sybil attacks, which leverages a large number of sybil accounts to generate results for dominating answers of normal workers. To address this problem, we propose a sybil defense framework for crowdsourcing, which can help crowdsourcing platforms to identify sybil workers and defense the sybil attack. We develop a similarity function to quantify worker similarity. Based on worker similarity, we cluster workers into different groups such that we can utilize a small number of golden questions to accurately identify the sybil groups. We also devise online algorithms to instantly detect sybil workers to throttle the attacks. Our method also has ability to detect multi-attackers in one task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework for sybil defense in crowdsourcing. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and throttle sybil workers.","inCitations":["cc2cbed913704b4f8ef0d6461937a345a59abf4b","652d7190bacc3846ed7a81c38b7eec11611724c3","1abce33510c1764f96c614635b4cf01203443bb2","d32e541b4d1a860e98c76d2b4305486e9627076d","1dedeaa3cda8a50d6f7f6980fc573a5d4a70e265"],"pmid":"","title":"Sybil Defense in Crowdsourcing Platforms","journalPages":"1529-1538","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/papers/sybil_defense_cikm.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133039"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Computer vision","Crowdsourcing","Graphical model","IBM Notes","Online algorithm","Similarity measure","Sybil attack"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4fd6f95aca0da395078d63c4f3be5a51f3ffef55","26196511e307ec89466af06751a66ee2d95b6305","ba24bd33caaa38127664f86d1bb486ac508b8a47","026972d6a94755c4a3ddf9ab0d463fd0416c4262","6953420c593842697dd09bc2cf7ffbbaf67a6e8e","2b89301f592033f0001f5d79ce33163d9249caab","fccf97f0f18415f797a6466ac4c7a0af0404c1ad","6ac7262028d905ad97bbabce37c610e5d84e4c6f","5b55010d6aa8b909ff588dccf1e4693e156cf41e","daa74853638d2d2ed0b471e911fc88ef90f2dd49","40c6e880da4fa9d3266e2ce60342b20a1eca106e","22fb9418f821f7c97f68ba3a6bf8d4cfdb0bfaa3","344d4acb44c6f3588189f5e8e78ccd7bb7efd4a3","5144ce3943d6dce07db0fa7469b54e1f3aea80ab","9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d","9009a63ad674075dbf55e39e78213e6d90fec369","a12cd3d9ae5530a90302a6e4af477e6e24fa0f95","031f0cb23d5969f2c9ff3a95e4f98721aab47e8b","5150c11a101c449ebcd1b8b508dc9b0b97a489a6","8d4594b4d4827f44b57863376d54536112b7aaca","0a645cbb39ac37929a2e6ba55fc248dc4ca967e4","46fbe8e7dac57f4dbfd91e353eae2d4cfd728e3d","ae1a0331abf71a21205d4c4971db30ab59f5f473","22ba0d428dc3935bb466ef5ae6414473b86327b0","66b43dbeef7a13a7f1dd36ce7564e888f7196ac5","0ba16f6b7920cdbdd4cf2f1e507053a90165a0ad","16c36a0ab390553d77877ee634607899e4eececf","0b4d55e4a0dca6eeccc21e34744dd3e4e54c24b4","ccc68bb05f3433f287de4f66fe9814760ebcafb3","d7f2fa3fd2d189c2e2edc23193626cb3a81e97a4","0c331de628700fb88f36e043a7bc017cf7897e4e","1a7651308dbbdf91ccf07886b016b5fa8678fd27","169404f79e4453fbad46a6c24e17e081aa44fefd","91ecef06c5338ba321428a953a038f7a163e56de","cf948d8b3c18c7d2ec8e746e417e540a47e56bfe","2cca87876d142c75626304700fb599e7944cf338","167e1359943b96b9e92ee73db1df69a1f65d731d","21a8d523097e2f19624f93688de22664e41b7a10"],"id":"aa96a257c28225901006502266aa65877897dc5d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa96a257c28225901006502266aa65877897dc5d","authors":[{"name":"Dong Yuan","ids":["6207866"]},{"name":"Guoliang Li","ids":["23492509"]},{"name":"Qi Li","ids":["1682467"]},{"name":"Yudian Zheng","ids":["2985907"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133039"}

To achieve this, however, we need to understand how healthy recommendations are and the factors which influence this. Focusing on two approaches from the literature (single item and daily meal plan recommendation) and utilizing a large Internet sourced dataset from Allrecipes.com, we show how algorithmic solutions relate to the healthiness of the underlying recipe collection. First, we analyze the healthiness of Allrecipes.com recipes using nutritional standards from the World Health Organisation and the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency. Second, we investigate user interaction patterns and how these relate to the healthiness of recipes. Third, we experiment with both recommendation approaches. Our results indicate that overall the recipes in the collection are quite unhealthy, but this varies across categories on the website. Users in general tend to interact most often with the least healthy recipes. Recommender algorithms tend to score popular items highly and thus on average promote unhealthy items. This can be tempered, however, with simple post-filtering approaches, which we show by experiment are better suited to some algorithms than others. Similarly, we show that the generation of meal plans can dramatically increase the number of healthy options open to users. One of the main findings is, nevertheless, that the utility of both approaches is strongly restricted by the recipe collection. Based on our findings we draw conclusions how researchers should attempt to make food recommendation systems promote healthy nutrition.","inCitations":["da784ec3e02cf6f492b768513228563184acf811","4341e0274ac9fd0dbbb1aedea00d99e7cf67fe8b","d6885f25b0f32b49dba6aaeffeebfce7e8e9af8e","b8747814ab808bd3ad370a6d7f59af0f63ccf008","a9b291a22aa3e53bc610d99429fc52ba2311e110","4e3fe6fdabe89cd9f68bedfd7a1afa61c4964987","0bf0033969f2f01076ce0c88f6fb660a33bd0a70","4f673332dbc6cda8c353c5b002c642ddbe621aa6","ba2b4f9272753995ba8d3a6f3ab93974ab16b9b2","5737c64e835401694ea801990f7b92eaf4c5f2e4","c4c235b5fe30f1c78b5835754d79bea0d14f3f7b","f9b9f095dd9d7e1ba83dd8dd790703d231216e9d","adf38763bf75fd7adc60ccd4990f604e0863bc8e","8f56a65f08e2155575c65880bc21c102eb764a8b","0724ce21fc53d6fff9a1527d1f32fbe30342f0b8","3c1232c55389a1130fb9a03338624140adaf9ad2","86ec379e71c0a23117ce92859aa0e7a1919ca575","ba1161443aa0398ed5596cb1cdf5d4a4f6cfbdf1","1f789764e74607185fcb2b459766f03f1fa8256d","1bc76186e2811a9b41be51a1ba1c3bbdbca7a789"],"pmid":"","title":"Investigating the Healthiness of Internet-Sourced Recipes: Implications for Meal Planning and Recommender Systems","journalPages":"489-498","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7d35/110932250f5d07fc3a38ed84027a1d824ae7.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/WWW2017.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052573","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p489.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Internet","Post's theorem","Recommender system"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6f834a080594581fbd18375458d136bb2ea43b1b","315a061bf865e25e27c245f1b1db2ce75b740d57","86ec379e71c0a23117ce92859aa0e7a1919ca575","906faaeee75cbb1af487ecd3ed662bd2c5360779","af6b154dc9b0a01d33b12256f7b2f5ad660e58e2","6f41a7728fe52a8699817f7492ca93f3b7fb7f3c","46fe4b246c4770381c316f3cb42f87cac60b498f","a319df28f00785fa5a0b2d6ab007a4d62fd71533","54ad7b5b37c486e135f1a7248ae85da4667280ab","db4237294b848a4f18180759a5423a85d102e3c1","39f778b49dfaf2daea9752e746828e09d6285a22","413317532f99f7e2ce7860ed57b7f5dbc440f3b0","1fe6066acdcc5fb57a5a1bb72a64f805df74be73","24f1a3ec9d02abcd3b5ed7f511b9d8017213954a"],"id":"7d35110932250f5d07fc3a38ed84027a1d824ae7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7d35110932250f5d07fc3a38ed84027a1d824ae7","authors":[{"name":"Christoph Trattner","ids":["1752070"]},{"name":"David Elsweiler","ids":["1735704"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052573"}

In this demonstration, we present API Caveat Explorer, a search system to explore API caveats that are mined from large-scale unstructured discussions on Stack Overflow. API Caveat Explorer takes API-oriented queries such as \"HashMap\" and retrieves API caveats by text summarization techniques. API caveats are represented by sentences, which are context-independent, prominent, semantically diverse and non-redundant. The system provides a web-based interface that allows users to interactively explore the full picture of all discovered caveats of an API, and the details of each.

However, the underlying notion of similarity has remained ambiguous. In this paper, we examine when exactly similarity values in word embedding models are meaningful. To do so, we analyze the statistical distribution of similarity values systematically, conducting two series of experiments. The first one examines how the distribution of similarity values depends on the different embedding-model algorithms and parameters. The second one starts by showing that intuitive similarity thresholds do not exist. We then propose a method stating which similarity values actually are meaningful for a given embedding model. In more abstract terms, our insights give way to a better understanding of the notion of similarity in embedding models and to more reliable evaluations of such models.","inCitations":["5e3c70326989b5508cff4b7c4f681c03e361b29d","f2c902e5e3e172647058be2529bbe25e12d2f123","f890022d8465ec0690da28d05477e389f046fb18"],"pmid":"","title":"On the Various Semantics of Similarity in Word Embedding Models","journalPages":"1-10","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://dbis.ipd.kit.edu/download/2017,3.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3200350"],"entities":["Algorithm","Digital library","Experiment","Library (computing)","Word embedding","Word2vec"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27211ed68a7a00f1df0121fa1890a1b2acdd1a88","c1efd29ddb6cb5cf82151ab25fbfc99e20354d9e","2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","e8e1eb95ba297a00af835e6fcba08a170287ff96","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","d5c0477cbd9e4d20417b1e965baca42e6739b431","3cfbb77e5a0e24772cfdb2eb3d4f35dead54b118","1c6a286638140e5c0015826a0a1f19c504e744b1","6ba99af82d3ef72923491d690ae7f05aad30bf3e","da95ceaf335971205f83c8d55f2292463fada4ef","0894b06cff1cd0903574acaa7fcf071b144ae775","7fcd5a6c155a7748ddc600fb9c7af401e2405ede","7f4c35d9f69ff3ca798e7f4f0947bf232a3c15e8","6aa3d8bcca2ebdc52ef7cd786204c338f9d609f2","4898e0c5bb8d93443f2f168c31e3f1827c9129de","5d43224147a5bb8b17b6a6fc77bf86490e86991a","63bf72357989ee624fb24384c55a259554ebbd04","0a32b3d027064798fb31ce42894fec31e834f7db","1a07186bc10592f0330655519ad91652125cd907","980c2517368aaa0d4a4972ff7bcc5cf3ec41656a","402200052fe06aa43e54d40a73168bf7c9619bac","917fbd64a435cb33e0e5b4cd73fe830db7b166db","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","75b0c67e9c81a880c29cb8d8a2dbcb7c96f4d644","11ace28f48e53bf5cda6b3c33e7bf168c78cee56","135c89b491f82bd4fd7de175ac778207f598342b","0aff5a5c873914ab4e939be958bdaddae9802172","beb12fc82cdc04169214c89059b3c849fc0655f1","142f38642629b9d268999ad876af482177d36697","a1a7d4b660558a0880c7333d3851000e439f6af7","5d833331b0e22ff359db05c62a8bca18c4f04b68","02df3d50dbd1d15c38db62ff58a5601ebf815d59","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","1944fda0d2aad86fdfac5f3c0d5c3b4055fa1336","1374617e135eaa772e52c9a2e8253f49483676d6","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","83a6cacc126d85c45605797406262677c256a6af","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","ce668a88e34dc8df1a95c7292688413274b8ed0b","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50"],"id":"57250cfb88a9d4cda06990b297737ea0dc3be8fb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57250cfb88a9d4cda06990b297737ea0dc3be8fb","authors":[{"name":"Ábel Elekes","ids":["48998463"]},{"name":"Martin Schäler","ids":["2385586"]},{"name":"Klemens Böhm","ids":["1750020"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JCDL.2017.7991568"}

At the core of the platform, there is a knowledge graph that is populated with new nodes and relationships as new data are ingested. Most public data sources in the financial domain are provided by country regulators, e.g. by enforcing companies to publish their annual reports online. However, we still find very important financial datasets, such as corporate announcements published daily as non-structured texts in PDF, which require an enormous adaptation effort and ad-hoc ETL tools to be automatically ingested and later analysed. In the case of private sources, we realized that financial datasets tend to be siloed and fragmented. Additionally, entity identifiers and formats for the same type of data sometimes differ between organizations. Another common problem is that the utilised data properties are not always properly documented, and they are rarely self-explanatory. The benefit of using a knowledge graph in our platform is threefold. First, it reduces the time spent on simple and repetitive data integration tasks. Second, the acquired knowledge is used by a virtual assistant to facilitate the data reconciliation process, thus users do not need to be experts to merge a new dataset. And third, it adds extra value to the customer information by linking knowledge to open and private data sources.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Populating the FLE Financial Knowledge Graph","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/141b/9a887280df6bcecd1250d2ee348ccbdd84db.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-89.pdf"],"entities":["Hoc (programming language)","Identifier","Information privacy","Knowledge Graph","Population","Portable Document Format","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"141b9a887280df6bcecd1250d2ee348ccbdd84db","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/141b9a887280df6bcecd1250d2ee348ccbdd84db","authors":[{"name":"Manuel Peña Muñoz","ids":["50008668"]},{"name":"Alejandro Llaves","ids":["3233351"]},{"name":"Terunobu Kume","ids":["2295953"]}],"doi":""}

Every day, a tremendous amount of information is being created, shared, and digested through all kinds of cyber channels. Although people can easily acquire information from various sources (social media, news articles, etc.), the truthfulness of most received information remains unverified. In many real-life scenarios, false information has become the de facto cause that leads to detrimental decision makings, and techniques that can automatically filter false information are highly demanded. However, verifying whether a piece of information is trustworthy is difficult because: (1) selecting candidate snippets for fact checking is nontrivial; and (2) detecting supporting evidences, i.e. stances, suffers from the difficulty of measuring the similarity between claims and related evidences. We build ClaimVerif, a claim verification system that not only provides credibility assessment for any user-given query claim, but also rationales the assessment results with supporting evidences. ClaimVerif can automatically select the stances from millions of documents and employs two-step training to justify the opinions of the stances. Furthermore, combined with the credibility of stances sources, ClaimVerif degrades the score of stances from untrustworthy sources and alleviates the negative effects from rumor spreaders. Our empirical evaluations show that ClaimVerif achieves both high accuracy and efficiency in different claim verification tasks. It can be highly useful in practical applications by providing multi-dimension analysis for the suspicious statements, including the stances, opinions, source credibility and estimated judgements.","inCitations":["1e380f2d4920aab98c1a5bf4edcd440be0dc8ebc"],"pmid":"","title":"ClaimVerif: A Real-time Claim Verification System Using the Web and Fact Databases","journalPages":"2555-2558","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133182","http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/cikm17_szhi.pdf"],"entities":["Big data","Database","IBM Notes","Internet Information Services","Learning classifier system","Quality of service","Real life","Real-time transcription","Real-time web","Semantic similarity","Sensor","Social media","Source-to-source compiler","Statistical classification","Verification and validation","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","2a501b074261e81b9126e80a0a308cfa5e76f8c1","5b49e7e564c40e0e1bb3254a5386744c3de056ca","03a54b9c8267a99632cf85deedd8f69c0b8567d2","308fb9872f256dd043e580930169a7fb851cd888","96b17f09f3afcc9238c1789208eeb016bc2a84d8","916f0019107a45b59aa568f61a3f52d4ae017033","699896507c186df548f7060be5317984bffd756a","b1121655f0858ba38226a4dd614e84cb86c2a8a6"],"id":"71c398fb1a524a71511d31fb6605c221ef416729","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/71c398fb1a524a71511d31fb6605c221ef416729","authors":[{"name":"Shi Zhi","ids":["2460465"]},{"name":"Yicheng Sun","ids":["6330798"]},{"name":"Jiayi Liu","ids":["1974207"]},{"name":"Chao Zhang","ids":["1720735"]},{"name":"Jiawei Han","ids":["1722175"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133182"}

This task has became complex due to the ever-growing number of news sources and the mixed tactics of maliciously false sources. To mitigate these problems, we introduce the The News Landscape (NELA) Toolkit: an open source toolkit for the systematic exploration of the news landscape. NELA allows users to explore the credibility of news articles using well-studied content-based markers of reliability and bias, as well as, filter and sort through article predictions based on the users own needs. In addition, NELA allows users to visualize the media landscape at different time slices using a variety of features computed at the source level. NELA is built with a modular, pipeline design, to allow researchers to add new tools to the toolkit with ease. Our demo is an early transition of automated news credibility research to assist human fact-checking efforts and increase the understanding of the news ecosystem as a whole.

While the conventional approaches rely mostly on manually compiled features to generate the summary, few attempts have been made in developing data-driven systems for extractive summarization. To this end, we present a fully data-driven end-to-end deep network which we call as Hybrid MemNet for single document summarization task. The network learns the continuous unified representation of a document before generating its summary. It jointly captures local and global sentential information along with the notion of summary worthy sentences. Experimental results on two different corpora confirm that our model shows significant performance gains compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.","inCitations":["5f52a2c6e896ad3d745f6f33e78b85e810d6234c","332c830987c32855c12be9d6d7a2a3ff3f84a294","2ef4a3f755beb0de66454678e2dce47d926eb0c9"],"pmid":"","title":"Hybrid MemNet for Extractive Summarization","journalPages":"2303-2306","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133127","http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/download/inproceedings.pdf.87db384a5a21f507.487962726964204d656d4e657420666f7220457874726163746976652053756d6d6172697a6174696f6e2028416268697368656b204b756d61722053696e67682c204d616e6973682047757074612c205661737564657661205661726d61292e706466.pdf"],"entities":["Automatic summarization","Baseline (configuration management)","Compiler","End-to-end principle","Natural language understanding","Text corpus"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9f0eb43643dd4f7252e16b1e3136e565e3ee940a","daf08d09c0c7eec3d20ca6d45c2b4d43d468a66d","3981b1c4fe4edba811bcbfcf743af82c768d3753","18b807ef88932a2db88655cf7c4d6c28bc7ad958","44fca068eecce2203d111213e3691647914a3945","236d4031b9dd6215cfce6bf66429892903610dc3","2c56d3a6e0c5260614ebd8bc843a29e18c4afbbc","52ebb5873677dd900a97e4bd4042fb40be14f937","6d9f0bcb44ac9a266e5de7eeada0f01b5f957d84","7453a974d355883f342aaa6e29eb86a13edcedb9","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","f12192424dfd1a2df308346520556a1a7ed6094c","1bc49abe5145055f1fa259bd4e700b1eb6b7f08d","4d36e239f21ae8d1553e38a050e465347e73d8f8","9d85b17a9fd8b256f7eda6056c7218326c377e33","2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","1c5d41ba83fb57b5fb5af81fac956154c9ff0ce4","04d458a49065e9cad46b243d004436a9cede3483","167abf2c9eda9ce21907fcc188d2e41da37d9f0b"],"id":"b42bb68816d1370b305a8ac8f66e6f3b29245487","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b42bb68816d1370b305a8ac8f66e6f3b29245487","authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Kumar Singh","ids":["33548725"]},{"name":"Manish Gupta","ids":["29960724"]},{"name":"Vasudeva Varma","ids":["1704709"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133127"}

However, the exposure of their locations raises privacy concerns. Especially for those who are not eventually selected for any task, their location privacy is sacrificed in vain. Hence, in this paper, we propose a location privacy-preserving task allocation framework with geoobfuscation to protect users\u2019 locations during task assignments. Specifically, we make participants obfuscate their reported locations under the guarantee of differential privacy, which can provide privacy protection regardless of adversaries\u2019 prior knowledge and without the involvement of any third-part entity. In order to achieve optimal task allocation with such differential geo-obfuscation, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem to minimize the expected travel distance of the selected workers under the constraint of differential privacy. Evaluation results on both simulation and real-world user mobility traces show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Particularly, our framework outperforms Laplace obfuscation, a state-ofthe-art differential geo-obfuscation mechanism, by achieving 45% less average travel distance on the real-world data.","inCitations":["b91d39175b1c8baca0975645f0e6896b1f607b54","d680c26be52825f1511de70ae79b1c44d021ad3c","5b69628950b6ac15e78c72da1c325e708ec97574","82575e1f5073856059d9849fb2ac17ae70000897","9e04a465027ace4c22a46369885fbc98e1b85f57","ec4e92691e8f0e7b9ea233a1354e14ee3656841c","aa36f580328d7170e521aeafe22e1de31653b9c4","88d79db1dd2b1f5315a2658d6bf96ee279d749f7","4f313915a6b57d76873645ed56b63599ca14d1b3","51a61f81b58ca8d55e555edb72115423b119ff3f","27954663db4258796fec038f284453168ac481ce","3c09f4895e6e387cab931c69aa08565b9874391f","e5c2a44a51a04fbf73c5bae249a896064d66e4d7","313684f96f4cd141cfce3948217c6356ef538ef6","f0e0c723f6ac8471e01ec34a95eab94fe2da11c4","b6c72ae000ee152996931b20f3bd39371e647c73","6c1b8fe5b8bc78cfd86c9350e886ec9599adec16"],"pmid":"","title":"Location Privacy-Preserving Task Allocation for Mobile Crowdsensing with Differential Geo-Obfuscation","journalPages":"627-636","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9b22/150e51d0e4fa8fe7eeeb44450a1dd3c64400.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p627.pdf","https://exascale.info/assets/pdf/www17_privacy_mcs_task_allocation.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052696"],"entities":["Crowdsensing","Differential privacy","Linear programming","Nonlinear programming","Nonlinear system","Simulation","Tracing (software)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["03c69bafc13e4b2cbda9dc7fa994382e1bfbd722","28b1eb01c96cd8612dc34ae99993c3b0461ef7e8","70fda5147aedd42c64143a464117b5ffde18a2e4","37bcd8bbe2cddd48f0ec152fc5ffa4fca93f3828","c436adf808853f390936f3247aeefdf91fc45428","50cb7bad034a5f345d34ddde84f981d7adbdc8b4","a44b2fbd07d6d17e968afc240ac212f9070b95c3","afae2c590351f4e2c0ffd1bf925000ae769831f8","75b752232397f1d60b5767fc455416c9b4e20b31","bf1e94ba685418c30683996fa166137b402a68bd","04bd64577c1f66486825c4ef9132cb94bb5334b4","276ec3680af9d9766532f2ff27b496920953ddd7","3437d29f603a7780eeeb094c40c42dcc3192a3fe","f95cb7292167f85a8bf2c9215d8e79697e65f7bc","22cd807965dea49e3ec0a8f68bb620932cfab4c2","4f7683b2701929f205e52022eade9b35bd23418f","08d97119b85a00052e0d86662a596f58e275f1ff","6db5ea096c386edd9ff95082436187a877bf5d48","7af7650a9fc91d3ba39aab7bbca2dc008d52811a","e145170d6ef59de3f45394e4813d081ec51219eb","9b2facb1b003bd0d5e0d0f426dd41afef05b523f","03b9563779bb1623a21c30386aef863ae4d11dc0","9155b200dd74a32949c97a2d632d99b8c0f55d9d","01719e72736d38944859785cc1c5f7510d40d602","e032fb2394612e3cf3937245e60ece378a71f858","5020aee0f020625640f2921229a29effea09cae8","25a1543aae8b2cd17d75a7930a8b13c23290eea4","0860ec7b445499bfabb5e660e56521e49ef7a82a","6f252bdcf2a61c8e544ba4890a1742e0edc1dc1b"],"id":"72b62cddec3e91336b6b58537b6a9b6265b4dfe9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72b62cddec3e91336b6b58537b6a9b6265b4dfe9","authors":[{"name":"Leye Wang","ids":["1690696"]},{"name":"Dingqi Yang","ids":["33829042"]},{"name":"Xiao Han","ids":["48506357"]},{"name":"Tianben Wang","ids":["2976666"]},{"name":"Daqing Zhang","ids":["1781633"]},{"name":"Xiaojuan Ma","ids":["3230330"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052696"}

However, finding ground truths especially for developing and rural areas is quite hard and manually labeling a large set of training data is costly. In this work, we propose an ongoing research named DeepVGI which aims at deeply learning from satellite imageries with the supervision of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). VGI data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and a crowdsourcing mobile application named MapSwipe which allows volunteers to label images with buildings or roads for humanitarian aids are utilized. Meanwhile, an active learning framework with deep neural networks is developed by incorporating both VGI data with more complete supervision knowledge. Our experiments show that DeepVGI can achieve high building detection performance for humanitarian mapping in rural African areas.","inCitations":["b1c5708fb3dbdb3aa1d91c0cc4aa32660196b0e0","49d4cb2e1788552a04c7f8fec33fbfabb3882995","db8d6040a0013fe05e316dc41b72717bfdfd88e2","c94e2413316aedc260ece9ba6f0f2ebe82407555","0726a5febc6b3d9b9fe128a437e6da1589b19388"],"pmid":"","title":"DeepVGI: Deep Learning with Volunteered Geographic Information","journalPages":"771-772","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9c6c/1c132512960988743f5e62b1b93898311e3d.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p771.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054250"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Crowdsourcing","Deep learning","Experiment","Mobile app","OpenStreetMap","Volunteered geographic information"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4bf034ec0f546ab28c0961fbe7a2ed7705af6579","cdfdaccd946dc2fe4863aed048b12b5d2282f285"],"id":"9c6c1c132512960988743f5e62b1b93898311e3d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9c6c1c132512960988743f5e62b1b93898311e3d","authors":[{"name":"Jiaoyan Chen","ids":["1731892"]},{"name":"Alexander Zipf","ids":["2924672"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054250"}

Furthermore, a general outline of an ICT4D development process is presented and scalability factors are related to phases in this ICT4D process. Future research could focus on validating these factors by using them in a development cycle and determining the precise influence, rather than determining an overall positive or negative influence.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Scalability Factors in an ICT4D Context: A Literature Review","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/83c0/006915fdb1a9dc8544e253a33c12b3a0ac61.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2120/paper5.pdf","https://perspectivesonict4d.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ict4d18_paper_21.pdf"],"entities":["Image scaling","Scalability","Technical standard"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["69ee0e2e1737ac16c5c9eb1b670547f34760fdd6","c130a316d37382ba89b05ffbaebfe85c0068e6ad","8b3c34edfcaf5eb6480b0d043b1b4685a54870dc","aac28cee68fea77c1d4845899893f3d83dd6d9b7","86c0754d758b14a292d1a946afecffe3033757ba","fa330c815fb3abeabeef87438bc011e7a335f152","a868368333781a30cecbabfae75e720f7e520d2d","b1f344dcc7637f06a83db1514fdc13968fbdb713","3ee2b18d7d1007166ea6a75a3daa3ab8941e77df","6adbf66fc0da23f69ff867da8044f7e030083cce","0591f8477c3cb96b75292020f22ccbb190b03a23","c0413a16e090a8b62cb0f046438e62011ac5ced7","ee59e6f2614e8f871b43b8069be44a887531ff90","fd3059d5fcbf3b9449fda2ad5488db0689df7a05","7e227a8ffb3f006c0ad00ba7992c4ff0f21d45f4","9871d9c634916db8ebcc7d67bc25e9864fa90c18","de2b21f6c0ab745432a35925c6cf8da4fe942739"],"id":"13e99fb7f1ebab50faf08f8d35e339df83192332","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/13e99fb7f1ebab50faf08f8d35e339df83192332","authors":[{"name":"Melchior Keijdener","ids":["51295648"]},{"name":"S.

In this paper, we introduce a new research problem that addresses the ability of fact-checking systems to distinguish Web search results that are useful in discovering the veracity of claims from the ones that are not.We also propose a re-ranking method to improve ranking of search results for fact-checking. To evaluate our proposed method, we conducted a preliminary study for which we have developed a test collection that includes 22 claims and 20 manually-annotated Web search results for each. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline represented by the original ranking of search results. The contributions this improvement brings to real-world applications is two-fold: it will help human fact-checkers find useful documents for their task faster, and it will help automated fact-checking systems by pointing out which documents are useful and which are not.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Re-ranking Web Search Results for Better Fact-Checking: A Preliminary Study","journalPages":"1783-1786","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269288"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Experiment","Learning to rank","Relevance","Usability testing","Veracity","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["768b5e0b5be77397e7c7308bdd8f2cb05c6bf019","8064f19f6f07e471a5ed84e3e862ab9b0763185a","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","8ed928ee22f6a6f6adb539b8221b46a51cf079bc","88a38d820a4dde01111112263ea1db5db97d0ab7","66352ea6097dfc4624a59463b50a8150062f2a14","7bde2195f2a4cd0219e092560ec46834b0042484","03c294ad75bd1bac92217419ac25358227f6a901","26a6fbcea178d19c1b35c6fd6626513b18e32228"],"id":"ba97013d4715285ca01e0bf018b83d60d5bfefb3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ba97013d4715285ca01e0bf018b83d60d5bfefb3","authors":[{"name":"Khaled Yasser","ids":["3262505"]},{"name":"Mucahid Kutlu","ids":["38330039"]},{"name":"Tamer Elsayed","ids":["1844365"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269288"}

In this paper, we identify the modes of disclosure and interaction that occur on the site, and evaluate why users are motivated to post and interact on the site, despite its reputation for facilitating cyberbullying. Through topic modeling - supplemented with manual annotation - of a large dataset of ASKfm posts, we identify and classify the rich variety of discourse posted on ASKfm, including both positive and negative forms, providing insights into the why individuals continue to engage with the site. These findings are complemented by a survey of young adults (aged 18-20) ASKfm users, which provides additional insights into users' motivations and interaction patterns. We discuss how the affordances specific to platforms like ASKfm, including anonymity and visibility, might enable users to respond to cyberbullying in novel ways, engage in positive forms of self-disclosure, and gain social support on sensitive topics. We conclude with design recommendations that would highlight the positive interactions on the website and help diminish the repurcussions of the negative interactions.","inCitations":["f53324dce27110b32545ce149ed5e56ad621cd89"],"pmid":"","title":"Beyond Cyberbullying: Self-Disclosure, Harm and Social Support on ASKfm","journalPages":"3-12","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091499"],"entities":["Cyberbullying","Discourse types","Interaction","Multimedia framework","Semiconductor industry","Social media","Social support","Topic model","User experience"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7c9c35c63b088c29ca26c792d6c07e4df38de608","bf3a7271860b1667e3ceb84e5bc400d2635ff8b7","2cf379819632deb93b2cd9250da25bf21fa25171","2db715a479c8961d3020fe906f7bedfa0311b937","12fabf5b64b8bbbb12493bbd86f375f803eb1be6","319764d09e38c9bb3508ca57fe8173ba46e271b3","0ee2da37957b9d5b3fcc7827c84ee326cd8cb0c3","a98e27cff7ce15aacb8ec74de6a6edc3d3da34a6","11fb8d8bba1cafde293233a29fa16fef40dba49d","6be3134d654d494cb781da09400d9da26793255b","d0a36e34753658838e5af4a0bf664e838fd45055","2fa0f80f566b46e2af9430308d9f1fa0d4dfaf78","625ef5356b3e8f7a787a805c23ce4c34640ed596","6078199249b6c42436b63c75b46ed2480e788094","3d890a2ec766f9ec146285ababde8d92ee6a099f","4344a0f9a34a4ab6ff903ef21c7055d7e5aa57d9","183bc2081327c2bd005485c3d44e561bcf499c17","4600ef38ff63255bb2d8bee4edc14f8c48a4dc81","058401914862910e2c4bfe7c5a1ff476dc61613d","08082d2b1ab0255bc3f66af1b5b64ea69595a0a0","fee14e570861573f920036f2abaae119fc46a659","169818d634984eddd3ed181033030e1a9d35a739","682c434becc69b9dc70a4c18305f9d733d03f581","81ce545054abe91c75ee1e1f26031bf1b52b7fdb","3ed2e0f6f1545639f471c8e91093a881297ee4dc","247f7f42a3c22cb6b66cbd0bbe2f50a30c41dd4c","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1"],"id":"8d6abeb4248f3dfbbb449c5100ef9b10202f4b35","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d6abeb4248f3dfbbb449c5100ef9b10202f4b35","authors":[{"name":"Zahra Ashktorab","ids":["2220428"]},{"name":"Eben M.

The normalized cut problem balances the total degree, instead of the size, of the resulting sets. Applications of graph cuts include community detection and computer vision. However, cut problems were originally proposed for static graphs, an assumption that does not hold in many modern applications where graphs are highly dynamic. In this paper, we introduce sparsest and normalized cuts in temporal graphs, which generalize their standard definitions by enforcing the smoothness of cuts over time. We propose novel formulations and algorithms for computing temporal cuts using spectral graph theory, divide-and-conquer and low-rank matrix approximation. Furthermore, we extend temporal cuts to dynamic graph signals, where vertices have attributes. Experiments show that our solutions are accurate and scalable, enabling the discovery of dynamic communities and the analysis of dynamic graph processes.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Spectral Algorithms for Temporal Graph Cuts","journalPages":"519-528","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8c57/817e522ecff57afa77e246c2c6679717df1d.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arlei/pubs/www18.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186118","http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04746","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04746v1.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Approximation","Baseline (configuration management)","Cut (graph theory)","Degree of a polynomial","Graph cuts in computer vision","Karp's 21 NP-complete problems","Maximum cut","Multiplexing","Perturbation theory","Scalability","Segmentation-based object categorization","Singular value decomposition","Spectral graph theory","Time complexity","Vertex (geometry)","Wavelet"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1521d39088b203ddac981d10d214f463449ae95b","e21e69968f6b4eb29ce49156ababa35fd6c53226","7d59fad9d141684981ba1e89a4f9bd9fdfdf507f","b7afbf1a4bd1796b127b612c79b776e1c6d7a21e","16b46a261b7e7892ed0f2ffcd231a08aa70b96a0","09031aa6d6743bebebc695955cd77c032cd9192f","8bdca6121b359cbbf6566e5a036741b572db37d1","9f87a99d35b0ca9ad3aa3cff0cab5dd8fd16e9d9","39139d20db9f7316b4c945a54fe67e216a784da0","3d181e91757bb6a6839b3665732ded751e35ff66","d6b63e12c44129b0dc06bb242ab1777c152cff89","71d1094206db2d3504bc9ba736646ee1cc0beed0","1c7e0a76c8a5d2b14fa73d639af6ad79da6cf059","11cbcb67914899e182b0799296f718a12ae5f92f","b94c7ff9532ab26c3aedbee3988ec4c7a237c173","4e2dbe62053f2436926a6159a21de522def7908c","2d2d84beafcf36d38eda7f5a3497011df1d83825","3591db67539b52a0e42ffc817e103a1843a33232","6a7c311ca3875f54543065f201a16ef1ac606c99","340774d21fb565da4a9081ac0d23909655f412d9","556087d4dd8b99f4f2a179f2f64134afc7495209","007d05563eae119fcd50b5dd976c792b22a45e73","b462ada2df76bec043e8dce8043a89253682b1a7","047699afd803d695f482277cbd6a10fef4b6c6c8","335f644137cdc45de2046e02b365ee0353d4a418","7ca41ed6116d223af3bb52efb55832ee6786a61c","5efb2cd71f9161aff8bf94543d23f697c6055878","0c8a049baf1e4d1f82a1b434fa70283733ac1688","36278bf6919c6dced7d16dc0c02d725e1ed178f8","241c93797b0a08da3193903b40936cfd1b8e0da4","40ba1623d0d2cf7ee42e8bbfdc20afb96c1d9fdc","fd4f24af30d64ca6375016249dc145b1f114ddc9","36ed19edc5c60bd7134889b2a837c8cb6893346b","d40532330078117068d1e0c85a9b824fa60a7a35","8dcc486e9bfc13a10a436cd7a63979d07389c941","1b0236860ba8293d15d784772b71d70ccebabe0c","34b64817eeccdb35f2ba30184e1130a2e0ee9fde","dc753ef05a4c8ef8e81aedf7a3911530742e7baf","244e7e6e2da2f6362cef3a2fae15c3ee113f0a8d","1041aa071904a7a8260cdb1352fc1b9a25c7aaa8","ba4b7d6ac15dc54ec073bbd9758126e7c1837e38"],"id":"8c57817e522ecff57afa77e246c2c6679717df1d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8c57817e522ecff57afa77e246c2c6679717df1d","authors":[{"name":"Arlei Silva","ids":["2865070"]},{"name":"Ambuj K.

News ranking has been addressed in the literature before but with individual news articles as the unit of ranking. However, estimating event importance accurately requires models to quantify current day event importance as well as its significance in the historical context. Consequently, in this paper we show that a cluster of news articles representing an event is a better unit of ranking as it provides an improved estimation of popularity, source diversity and authority cues. In addition, events facilitate quantifying their historical significance by linking them with long-running topics and recent chain of events. Our main contribution in this paper is to provide effective models for improved news event ranking.\n To this end, we propose novel event mining and feature generation approaches for improving estimates of event importance. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluation of our approaches on two large real-world news corpora each of which span for more than a year with a large volume of up to tens of thousands of daily news articles. Our evaluations are large-scale and based on a clean human curated ground-truth from Wikipedia Current Events Portal. Experimental comparison with a state-of-the-art news ranking technique based on language models demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.","inCitations":["b58a7454f8008543dc6d80ab630d76b99411719c","a9437b934dc7434626139283a6cf7258d43b0e6d","41d2af438260fb00f437e14d59d5e468c5b063c3","185d74cb63d33cff0e562ae7105a2ebd540d0e63","25274b74abd3f3bcbc9b5b9bbc39096ed957a847","98eef16929d5e30197e72ea821e392a07f404d3e","550722916b99c662ddd063706a053d6e5be34fd3","2bf6cd490ef0eaa3e7e45b91db02b62c825602e2","fb4349ef4f5eb16b0b25ed050f7b9a5101b44730"],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling Event Importance for Ranking Daily News Events","journalPages":"231-240","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~amishra/papers/WSDM2017.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018728"],"entities":["Ground truth","Language model","News aggregator","Text corpus","Wikipedia","World News (WN) Network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["408b97932d833dce6b464c235b12096c8d47f88e","39101b6482e21eccbd77f2dee6a3710037e4ba6f","0e58d66ee3d76b889c20b0d587167ccba45d96e6","02d1105bec3877ed8cd2d28f76b67ae8ba3f2331","132f7b35625b21b043d0226c4a7135c4ef78e38a","25c5e79aa25ba1cf4780caa6cd5c3a3b755a4213","0a9621c60889c34e2ccc4848a58cbbcef924cf4d","427b168f490b56716f22b129ac93aba5425ea08f","2347b18b22173f4c81f39297034eed7ce6e8c724","863f25633d298043a616264d8150d3e1888762f3","7a0e5002fbf02965b30c50540eabcaf6e2117e10","3148be0d8687c3567bf00084a81d06d5d5d45a91","88c76b7c9dd801109f9c9c70bbd82c2765e449df","b0dc83c726be27c1fc1ceb4c93dbb157152b91b0","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","18834b621d49b59727a097c25285db8da51312f3","125dc6849f752d6b2919f1b2b1479779533b9518","dcf007e46359c708ed851706830decc401392382","18b9a786ca2585a7e2e4278d6778e4fc831c849a","1476d40e82ed7b8fc75ad702ba368e734af5ac7f","a1c89ae7c0576d672ff39a65cc1d4d81b32a0350","9a7c156fe8f728b480c23ad5d82a457e781d6bb2","837b071d4c83e0f90d3e6b6edc1a2d4ca35711fb","526acf565190d843758b89d37acf281639cb90e2","17d56526a359ab357b3a1e4eae39697b312e3e5e","1c799eca7983c62f7815ac5f41787b3e552567b6","242512e09c584f29ac1e840df5f4ab5d4ff5c927","576fc3443d213c45256f700b0f619bad30af21f6","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","72bde1a4087394193ad22b962a8913a496cdc917","8fb7f53b8808700b6d8e8d39ac4a936b841ee328","373fd1b2149546ff97ea874ae73f8eef989a11b9","98d43e5a3e82e33dd9a70902f4f34f9b493860a1","170391a16a9da6a2f515c6177962764e7cb2f57b","d8aca39a2113150811b63ff443f42ddac9a4935a","0fc5df3225fe2e0cda4c66c2a14dc68ff8315d18"],"id":"608eb7045f77868a1e219ef5fdf6d13d67d6ed3f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/608eb7045f77868a1e219ef5fdf6d13d67d6ed3f","authors":[{"name":"Vinay Setty","ids":["2852530"]},{"name":"Abhijit Anand","ids":["3429593"]},{"name":"Arunav Mishra","ids":["2702051"]},{"name":"Avishek Anand","ids":["39775488"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018728"}

In this work, we study this question in the context of data streams, where elements arrive one at a time, and we want to design low-memory and fast update-time algorithms that maintain a good solution. Specifically, we focus on the sliding window model, where we are asked to maintain a solution that considers only the last W items. In this context, we provide the first non-trivial algorithm that maintains a provable approximation of the optimum using space sublinear in the size of the window. In particular we give a 1/3 − approximation algorithm that uses space polylogarithmic in the spread of the values of the elements, Φ, and linear in the solution size k for any constant > 0 . At the same time, processing each element only requires a polylogarithmic number of evaluations of the function itself. When a better approximation is desired, we show a different algorithm that, at the cost of using more memory, provides a 1/2− approximation and allows a tunable trade-off between average update time and space. This algorithm matches the best known approximation guarantees for submodular optimization in insertion-only streams, a less general formulation of the problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms on a number of real world datasets, showing that their practical performance far exceeds the theoretical bounds. The algorithms preserve high quality solutions in streams with millions of items, while storing a negligible fraction of them.","inCitations":["0b455ddce2b5d70c7d70ce307db2f05e94ebb814","7358ec03a2f0eecc259d716611a2296a724ffd78","d3610afdd69229cfd8a91e89e958caef3806b0d5","4e3f69e782337e6d9c6429473ed4f11769f64cdd","a3d0be57568882d9ee8cdd24edb4271b3686888f","ff49a0d12bf870551bf05f55ef1d1929135af54f","04376a241d021461eb55b6a8a1391679a73cfa6e","025b72a172a043331d152738f8d1c3fe5244100c","b1baf16b5840cfad6771c70ef106c12636a5148a","e1b21974e1266b0e0440b742a2d10d2478f0a897","1369fcb6fa9bf13d98188ab72d4361db30ef7b38","51fd78f60d38974e0db5afe3dfb98f249c78a96d","ed15d8eb27cb3df2374ee6d97900abe9539f2b06"],"pmid":"","title":"Submodular Optimization Over Sliding Windows","journalPages":"421-430","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bed6/5c0c0a54d28508efb64ae79fb2537bb9f6f8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052699","http://www.epasto.org/papers/fp1170-epasto.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09984","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p421.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09984v1.pdf"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Data mining","Display resolution","Diversification (finance)","Machine learning","Mathematical optimization","Microsoft Windows","Polylogarithmic function","Provable prime","Stream (computing)","Submodular set function","Window function","monotone"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a83cb80dd4ed5160c66dbd31c7782b01e7a97170","4cd73382dc17561cd276f276c61d5ebf39bf69ad","21f1c244319db25f87c54df05da5c07d07aafbb7","9dfa905a0752964bed222d9b71e4f473b00cea94","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","e77cd8265efdb21ff0fa5251c4476c7297a90f52","99ba32eb17d05f63297b1fb067a515c2a354cc7b","cc9e2321bd6b1c46fa4847b8b8af60fbd0555c03","72b992cd5b0461d3922d61aba4e13fd71fd9bb79","0f491624578a99e197e2fcfde710371c386ff513","843f186c7f38f5d434f46ca55b6dea7d5f14deef","2f9f77ee4fa453cd114665f8b487570c0affe235","5dacca459e9cc4fec59be31d7a685a46e056cc00","82afdb9f6b3441bbe4e8a5d6e1d0f5a647748d68","047d078f6cfed4cc067643b5e15f4e8f65a97c0b","3d25eb8241345f86101fda145d95d89c27844fd1","04311b15b444a0f75ea2bb74fca26cc1aefbf3c1","f19dbebc5821baead29708e3d1e7b4b70f2c7d48","28dd94325f1fe6a8ea5787abe3bbdf7dfea71259","abbdb6177b4408c5885a569dc24e6361f91cf169","a7ccb9bbdb4fc36a02e1290e7f50bb279dc6bc36","8f63361bd17d8a5a22f0651f7bf013bbfbdde653","379ef18377d803d87859314c0e110cdf64f2ea73","b9e43395663f74c581982e9ca97a0d7057a0008c"],"id":"bed65c0c0a54d28508efb64ae79fb2537bb9f6f8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bed65c0c0a54d28508efb64ae79fb2537bb9f6f8","authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Epasto","ids":["3356743"]},{"name":"Silvio Lattanzi","ids":["1895843"]},{"name":"Sergei Vassilvitskii","ids":["1749789"]},{"name":"Morteza Zadimoghaddam","ids":["1724391"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052699"}

A strong prerequisite of this study is to collect, with the limitations of the Twitter API, tweets linked to media events that are representative of the real Twitter activity. This paper describes two proposed approaches to handle this important task. The first one, inspired by information retrieval, puts the focus on query formulation. It consists on bridging the vocabulary gap between traditional news articles and tweets, by iteratively modifying the queries sent to the Twitter API depending on the tweets retrieved by previous queries. The second approach consists in streaming a representative sample of all emitted tweets and dynamically clustering them in events. We also discuss approaches to evaluate the collected datasets under the point of view of their representativity of the real activity on Twitter.","inCitations":["d24bb69dab7994a0e9a06b38f7f32e8c9dfd8aa7"],"pmid":"","title":"Real-Time Collection of Reliable and Representative Tweets Datasets Related to News Events","journalPages":"23-34","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/03f6/304cd3a914ea33bcb24acb9e40030a1ab821.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2078/paper2.pdf"],"entities":["Application programming interface","Bridging (networking)","Cluster analysis","Dynamic linker","Information retrieval","Multimodal interaction","Randomness","Real-time transcription","User interface","Vocabulary"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["686ea4056bd23c2a05baa324722a3194dac8eef8","df22cca197ea12fc2cd5c30b4647802fd6c37536","3716a023c953e9a7dc867a46e5bce5a974e700d2","55ce907d81337f01aea97b99cbefac2b8fbdfee9","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","252df9cf640bd10d3770279ce7b81007a7033073","0814694a247a9b6e38dde34ab95067a63f67e458","4b46d07decbfdf42381fd58c78cf1d4cebacabf6","0eb7d2f39565f35cc3f50636d4f91b87e9f80031","2cf379819632deb93b2cd9250da25bf21fa25171","5012cc15338e4894d672c2b45841e45310f5d19f","13a92a59545eefbaf5ec3adf6000ec64f4bb73a5","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","5232bd2b6b75e168817fd5de35cb08d6530b4e95","27ffb5b00737113ab8810955afa3aad72af9dfd2","7687a755350038675f0a663e7ff5e7a8f6274bdb","740ac7c63f97d4716d556e729f32fe5809d22ce7","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","37c90fcd3016171e9f3ac86f7f88b390fe86ee99","c2a877dae041ddc2b63d97a6e9a2acfd192b987e","a86ca16740e87254364f9c7714062db573debf21","1b255cda9c92a5fbaba319aeb4b4ec532693c2a4","3cad340a4ee2707be7e1f09712651b3f67f613d5","7bf12a6733a7da5051327c42b5fcc04f7f129548","d4fef13e360bab843bcfd1faaf65c47669ee8bb1","214adc2dfdc2160cdf5be54001daf2b2304a03b3","8475f0cba13ca793231f6814700568ba9d38f994","01ff2b834772dfc2b8b7ba00620b65abb9444a75","4995fbc1375cd608ebecf982eabe7aeb3ec913c5"],"id":"03f6304cd3a914ea33bcb24acb9e40030a1ab821","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03f6304cd3a914ea33bcb24acb9e40030a1ab821","authors":[{"name":"Béatrice Mazoyer","ids":["40693387"]},{"name":"Julia Cagé","ids":["34191537"]},{"name":"Céline Hudelot","ids":["1931593"]},{"name":"Marie-Luce Viaud","ids":["2669129"]}],"doi":""}

It allows to follow the evolution of the opinions or to carry out investigations on web resource (e.g. courses, movies, products). The detection of contradictory opinions is an important task to evaluate the latter. This paper focuses on the problem of detecting and estimating contradiction intensity based on the sentiment analysis around specific aspects of a resource. Firstly, certain aspects are identified, according to the distributions of the emotional terms in the vicinity of the most frequent names in the whole of the reviews. Secondly, the polarity of each review segment containing an aspect is estimated using the state-of-the-art approach SentiNeuron. Then, only the resources containing these aspects with opposite polarities (positive, negative) are considered. Thirdly, a measure of the intensity of the contradiction is introduced. It is based on the joint dispersion of the polarity and the rating of the reviews containing the aspects within each resource. The evaluation of the proposed approach is conducted on the Massive Open Online Courses collection containing 2244 courses and their 73,873 reviews, collected from Coursera. The results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach to detect and quantify contradictions.","inCitations":["d24bb69dab7994a0e9a06b38f7f32e8c9dfd8aa7"],"pmid":"","title":"Contradiction in Reviews: Is it Strong or Low?","journalPages":"11-22","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0554/a5a942c23cc8a107f606a2bd38aa2d40ab0c.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2078/paper1.pdf","https://adrianchifu.com/docs/ECIR2018.pdf","https://hal-amu.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01793873/document"],"entities":["Experiment","Massive open online course","Sensor","Sentiment analysis","Supervised learning","Web resource"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a28d49640a5a4b2adf9abce19a2f0b47a1ea20c4","92959bb190129995aaec1fb5b53f4981a79d445f","033b62167e7358c429738092109311af696e9137","c6845a3080374394904f418411f08548091b7562","d8f9bd8c4fc1f10de358b1a2aabc06e013001fbe","13e5f0c40c85ca8e01b3756963d5352358de7c29","04bf3f1ec7a5932e21321799e550612f40c846e8","107d67337dadd4646d0d3a70c1be1671a7a4cd36","9fa83defa708e974314defe49c5a11004fd2b929","353bb015f569f86a441bda5dd407d7d28de238af","0a80c7faa7b2c69a2a667054d433ec91617c502d","0941c04cc69460dcddbe2b337e21e9cb5cec52fb","90aa6db47425277d1488ff18e214bddd9a733d76","7dec03bcf97f2440e4178f574aa5dcc8b7bee7e8","4f1fe957a29a2e422d4034f4510644714d33fb20","3eaf65791c7c5eed6901d95a2178be2f0a11846f","3b4577005c2132cb8d9cb7015cb5fd05f0ce1700","e55b1060f17e72cb5c4cb13aedf299df236d031c","095fc8aac545cc280199fd2770b46ea54ed6c720","5f7a57784e91dd02295f58603fac5a9c9df66d40","fa1d43626cd4a7b806cdf525564364084e62047f","15cd5edcbf4e865f879268a309682062b0abe63c","21ef9c68739b0ddc7a9be31091c1882791e92780","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","480c4b254a1a579669f13259cc475c42b58cff83","000e5ccddf685a7569982833ea937bea28831c63","0fe1624d902c8123a4392f0558c0f10e3b98ddb2","471c76aff7607770a5d4f364577148803044409e","664ec878de4b7170712baae4a7821fc2602bba25","1740ba3b5ade0dbc9044a4f6583de9a4239ab272","c82854b8d4c715da141d34c73bf9bda67adf307c"],"id":"a41dde280427a450358ee0c26a59f35de194f949","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a41dde280427a450358ee0c26a59f35de194f949","authors":[{"name":"Ismail Badache","ids":["2751283"]},{"name":"Sébastien Fournier","ids":["2341424"]},{"name":"Adrian-Gabriel Chifu","ids":["3086796"]}],"doi":""}

The workaround usually consists in resampling topics from an existing collection and approximating the statistics of interest with the observations made between random subsamples, as if one represented the population and the other a random sample. However, this methodology is clearly limited by the availability of data, the impossibility to control the properties of these data, and the fact that we do not really measure what we intend to. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method based on vine copulas for stochastic simulation of evaluation results where the true system distributions are known upfront. In the basic use case, it takes the scores from an existing collection to build a semi-parametric model representing the set of systems and the population of topics, which can then be used to make realistic simulations of the scores by the same systems but on random new topics. Our ability to simulate this kind of data not only eliminates the current limitations, but also offers new opportunities for research. As an example, we show the benefits of this approach in two sample applications replicating typical experiments found in the literature.

Random Walk with Restart (RWR) is a popular measure to estimate the similarity between nodes and has been exploited in numerous applications. Many real-world graphs are dynamic with frequent insertion/deletion of edges; thus, tracking RWR scores on dynamic graphs in an efficient way has aroused much interest among data mining researchers. Recently, dynamic RWR models based on the propagation of scores across a given graph have been proposed, and have succeeded in outperforming previous other approaches to compute RWR dynamically. However, those models fail to guarantee exactness and convergence time for updating RWR in a generalized form. In this paper, we propose OSP, a fast and accurate algorithm for computing dynamic RWR with insertion/deletion of nodes/edges in a directed/undirected graph. When the graph is updated, OSP first calculates offset scores around the modified edges, propagates the offset scores across the updated graph, and then merges them with the current RWR scores to get updated RWR scores. We prove the exactness of OSP and introduce OSP-T, a version of OSP which regulates a trade-off between accuracy and computation time by using error tolerance ε . Given restart probability c , OSP-T guarantees to return RWR scores with O(ε/c) error in O(log(1−c)( 2 )) iterations. Through extensive experiments, we show that OSP tracks RWR exactly up to 4605× faster than existing static RWR method on dynamic graphs, and OSP-T requires up to 15× less time with 730× lower L1 norm error and 3.3× lower rank error than other state-of-the-art dynamic RWR methods.","inCitations":["a0da1be7b7665b8c23d80ad2b03815dd708cd7b9","b62b1f9e05a49780d196308e1bb9da2c3e753b1f","a5faf8285360624935cc51e0b29757039d89ebb7"],"pmid":"","title":"Fast and Accurate Random Walk with Restart on Dynamic Graphs with Guarantees","journalPages":"409-418","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40cb/86ffbc0c127bcae3137138da10f217716779.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang/papers/ospWWW2018.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00595v1.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00595","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186107","http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00595"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["08a075443b26746bef0feaf4e8562d02164fa3d1","41a70062d260feb62e0ae64acf252a839c0bbd61","47f0455d65a0823c70ce7cce9749f3abd826e0a7","07ad62b6b5da5f226c88549378886ca062e207a0","4f9df283f1dac228fbbd3efd50765ecb317efe6c","ecedb62f9852e1b6c00d4298495a37b2f8803a7d","793904f11464cd0e9a468c98c5a10f4e0266a38f","2b5bc598cd02362874245ccfd932f65f6bc571d9","dd797b147f54e037a776b8c874a95a874fa272e1","aedc1fbd8902e6a6a7abb09b6d53c36ff8f47497","3e1e5a5edd5858d906b49363984a3e3659fb9478","009dbf3187862352aac542bf7d61e27bce6b27f5","d9f5683fbe2e98f6b90a03444a04a5b8d12cf6e0","2ce008f673e8618325c66826682011a190a95c10","a07cde5b64d07d8d04b6a39cdf936493e26e1ff9","8e0699c71c80d1f25e5eb46af03e83e7db340809","eeefbf53d11563f0909f1b4821b0457a2fe32258","b9d2295a9af8b29aadb197873e6ff06bbdb22958","2eed842c2cf908df5c5d9c1c1e0a160ecd881679","2a622720d4021259a6f6d3c6298559d1b56e7e62","237dc6e66cc6691bf2245c02cc19a6e0c077fde9","0e88a4e565d8bd9a541b608e541e284dac963daa","d51114842599996d6c1d49fba79a6cd6d4542386","1dd8db60043f51c04eb7200915ebd253d2fabf64","408cd9103f2d7cdafce2f6b984035b2be0ed9b7d","99bc084883a79cbb6d1a462afecba70a25cf7a9f","4c08596f935bb0af66fe3bd42c1f612f59a2202c","468c3b2bf358d07cc625b075f91595d825299948"],"id":"90e8eaf57d72c2536e04f3ecbe74b77e91e46774","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/90e8eaf57d72c2536e04f3ecbe74b77e91e46774","authors":[{"name":"Minji Yoon","ids":["50736424"]},{"name":"Woojeong Jin","ids":["8844876"]},{"name":"U.

Unlike previous work, which is limited to retrieving existing tables, we aim to answer queries by automatically compiling a table in response to a query. We introduce and address the task of on-the-fly table generation: given a query, generate a relational table that contains relevant entities (as rows) along with their key properties (as columns). This problem is decomposed into three specific subtasks: (i) core column entity ranking, (ii) schema determination, and (iii) value lookup. We employ a feature-based approach for entity ranking and schema determination, combining deep semantic features with task-specific signals. We further show that these two subtasks are not independent of each other and can assist each other in an iterative manner. For value lookup, we combine information from existing tables and a knowledge base. Using two sets of entity-oriented queries, we evaluate our approach both on the component level and on the end-to-end table generation task.","inCitations":["9a3f9429d3b87a1007efe8cc2a8731d7eb9a117d","434d2b9c218297e72037864cfee1cccb6a1ba102"],"pmid":"","title":"On-the-fly Table Generation","journalPages":"595-604","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04875v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209988","http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04875"],"entities":["Column (database)","Compiler","End-to-end principle","Entity","Information needs","Iteration","Knowledge base","Lookup table","Table (information)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2b9cd09b949b7e69933d18ae408397e803987151","434d2b9c218297e72037864cfee1cccb6a1ba102","c6ed75ad2a7ae4035e3e41cc1cf5f6e04142a198","8c39c16e9140ad7f5e1e8949714bd3dbefd7147c","289fedc40ec84b3fca13e6d0980cd8253763e549","967c904c9bb02c7989cde1ff9a2be133615440b0","e9ec458f726a71164c5df0270cf7d49bcd7ea43a","1bd5866dd08522225b865019fc13f87f79c50404","1e8def0173f498303b0a252f16b7d4999385a32c","5a2c2277baa4d96db3e4c4f544652364055fb171","0d756460546595eb7097b3f9c5d27179c1f002fd","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","67357c10a866b0140c82c1a582d29cb28ca350a0","9f5d1ac4bd9900238ac238fa221191aa436e87a1","0c687d5f26d78f2ba5e66e47af6db721c639f907","23eb5f05d8efd7399c27f46685067cb25c4dd197","0e27493639268ecd35356e5e08d45e5d0dcd7fd8","515b9903cb55e548b6732e953a1bd51f457c6353","7673ba3e72a07d4bbfb6b03d806fc3d8f0283105","87ffc4a3dcfd52a136361a1c10302bfb2781c10b","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","803bdfe0aacfa83df63fe1322636821e2d6732b1","9a4f3f87bfe008a2a396b712bc73beaf419ebc42","e8808581cda898f83dadcc79403064a584ac8bd0","06c3c9acc2d85c229ff2507156765363e553e951","a38cd38da57c638574c00101edb04a78394f9aeb","7aed13992bb8066f1b4eb18a0cb91a54b42a2724","33b94ba1d8b02f05d42954025798210867a833b7","1f990d98dcc3941f01bd6bb5405fbda37e00dd6a","0149426acc46840697acd4c60afbc11ab29ed853","249e73a10351b9e9d2150762a287df0698d4f830","45b830bac3764a3c941f7b2bec905663ac9f24f0","fc2f98cb904e1f939cbf9212b4053e0ac3c66dc6","9d2ad48567b5b7e1537d499dc2190504f007d05e"],"id":"d180097754c5487bee93ea80069cc3fb696416c1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d180097754c5487bee93ea80069cc3fb696416c1","authors":[{"name":"Shuo Zhang","ids":["47180808"]},{"name":"Krisztian Balog","ids":["1680484"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3209988"}

Towards this goal, we propose an unsupervised, domain-independent, and scalable two-phase algorithm to type and extract key concept mentions into aspects of interest (e.g., Techniques, Applications, etc.). In the first phase of our algorithm we proposePhraseType, a probabilistic generative model which exploits textual features and limited POS tags to broadly segment text snippets into aspect-typed phrases. We extend this model to simultaneously learn aspect-specific features and identify academic domains in multi-domain corpora, since the two tasks mutually enhance each other. In the second phase, we propose an approach based on adaptor grammars to extract fine grained concept mentions from the aspect-typed phrases without the need for any external resources or human effort, in a purely data-driven manner. We apply our technique to study literature from diverse scientific domains and show significant gains over state-of-the-art concept extraction techniques. We also present a qualitative analysis of the results obtained.","inCitations":["4f35141db179aa5deae03d6ad8f58779b692a9cb"],"pmid":"","title":"Unsupervised Concept Categorization and Extraction from Scientific Document Titles","journalPages":"1339-1348","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/cikm17_akrishnan.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133023","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02271v3.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02271"],"entities":["Algorithm","Categorization","Generative model","Knowledge base","Open road tolling","Scalability","Scientific literature","Spec#","Text corpus","Two-phase commit protocol","Unsupervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2a5e619f2c5f4220438b1357e596db5b1578398d","6629785cb5c9c96921f97e7a8c56dbe63f80d9ef","6ebe74aadb5b940eba75a95ed8b666ebea9d1a9f","9c64d35a2da75283cd7fa8b2aaf01897dd5c3f46","65eaf7c23641f70990ec149cf77c44c17a2142e6","058ad0815ce350f0e7538e00868c762be78fe5ef","b8fcd0a9031e9fee2813351b54f771fba080f275","b179637efe07b58d4e0d2fb734b6cfe3a9d53d6c","fbbd7ffe7f681d8319fe1f5f1229d352f78225d9","4ae2167b3b704ea3b59d8da30cf843b33f6f7c7b","1de45d1563d6a36af3bc831ef54b9ebddc9dda39","58196b1fa3183491bcfcf525fd730d95ebf6cb1e","1c9f2beef42f4023911f62311c53ed43d77948bb","86425d891bdf861a3368c288bdee8d98d843c216","4ea3cd5fbcca868f8a1cdb74ea91b471ed5ce1f7","c74639a3fc648e19d46b5f52cd40ba8bec936184","86d401b968e8590626d96919cd69887df850f86a","09ec387286f99ede233af307cc41e032279953ec","a67f1f0dac9eab51f444a1c22215ebc972b05fa1","0cda68237d8ba29bd320c729e6b0855313aa9e7b","87f2101c46f191512a62f78c68a2560d35ce613b","27496a2ee337db705e7c611dea1fd8e6f41437c2","42edc7fd8b8948523b0c03cfdb1534eb35423bc6","23e4844f33adaf2e26195ffc2a7514a2e45fd33d","c02e15974262dc909a000f0b2aae5f0cbb93841b","c4e970357ab88bea583211c7705c7283eebf219b","823262c42414bfaba9a0cea736e1c77c7cea7837","10d4190f9551546f6f0a438ea479206f94c25313"],"id":"c8cf4d0d4d6276391ac98ef34f85cebcafbb328c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c8cf4d0d4d6276391ac98ef34f85cebcafbb328c","authors":[{"name":"Adit Krishnan","ids":["33842085"]},{"name":"Aravind Sankar","ids":["1826045"]},{"name":"Shi Zhi","ids":["2460465"]},{"name":"Jiawei Han","ids":["1722175"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133023"}

Completeness of a data source is essential in many cases. Yet, most missing value imputation approaches suffer from severe limitations. They are almost exclusively restricted to numerical data, and they either offer only simple imputation methods or are difficult to scale and maintain in production. Here we present a robust and scalable approach to imputation that extends to tables with non-numerical values, including unstructured text data in diverse languages. Experiments on public data sets as well as data sets sampled from a large product catalog in different languages (English and Japanese) demonstrate that the proposed approach is both scalable and yields more accurate imputations than previous approaches. Training on data sets with several million rows is a matter of minutes on a single machine. With a median imputation F1 score of 0.93 across a broad selection of data sets our approach achieves on average a 23-fold improvement compared to mode imputation. While our system allows users to apply state-of-the-art deep learning models if needed, we find that often simple linear n-gram models perform on par with deep learning methods at a much lower operational cost. The proposed method learns all parameters of the entire imputation pipeline automatically in an end-to-end fashion, rendering it attractive as a generic plugin both for engineers in charge of data pipelines where data completeness is relevant, as well as for practitioners without expertise in machine learning who need to impute missing values in tables with non-numerical data.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"\"Deep\" Learning for Missing Value Imputationin Tables with Non-Numerical Data","journalPages":"2017-2025","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272005"],"entities":["Application programming interface","Artificial neural network","Column (database)","Computer multitasking","Deep learning","End-to-end principle","Experiment","F1 score","Feature extraction","Geo-imputation","Graphics processing unit","Heuristic (computer science)","Information privacy","Information retrieval","Language-independent specification","Level of measurement","Long short-term memory","Loss function","Machine learning","Mathematical optimization","Missing data","N-gram","Nearest neighbor search","Numerical analysis","Open-source software","Pipeline (computing)","Recommender system","Scalability","Sparse matrix","Text corpus","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5c6d93741b89a82fb8e8a20ccde734623f4adfa2","3784b73a1f392160523400ec0309191c0a96d86f","080aebd2cc1019f17e78496354c37195560b0697","5b62860a9eb3492c5c2d7fb42fd023cae891df45","24281c886cd9339fe2fc5881faf5ed72b731a03e","bfcce714788e2d9183e7b377b90cea9dedca9036","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","563e821bb5ea825efb56b77484f5287f08cf3753","464195f162b675595908486939523494d0efb2ab","323fe54df34e0dc2325fc9c1c090abd66b827122","4954fa180728932959997a4768411ff9136aac81","8735340bed4503bf21e50ec65872ceee68301470","023cc7f9f3544436553df9548a7d0575bb309c2e","4d05d5d080dd3281183885e42448bcb4779b05bb","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","7a971b8e5a7bc267ee0617e9747f24b85bf5659f","006336b4082bbba1ab1e5e2e6c633a44971a7dc3","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1be16d8c557b15cdf2db9e7eb4453f2274fd60af","659fc17e5d1015bc327fd33b2c490673327fb0e6","01c71603c2e9c42eb3141dd32d0ee564fb5274b4","6306fbfa8fcde8e98a677cd4a833b8c76c613974","1eb131a34fbb508a9dd8b646950c65901d6f1a5b","e3445d7de264269ef3a00aacc803cf360ea9192b","804c82b81618a19132ddb0039718ef71ce8e8a19","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","ca58d8872fc0f7b59d827a79bc70496e41528d77","0a267d927cfae039cf0a9c995a59ded563344eb6","03d36ce9c7feb820855fbf7d8e3856a6450ab51e","ed3fc9d20c76ead32209962be4d27e67530ceed0"],"id":"06e43829f9862f62ea38192a06e0f010737a07df","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/06e43829f9862f62ea38192a06e0f010737a07df","authors":[{"name":"Felix Bießmann","ids":["2170760"]},{"name":"David Salinas","ids":["36500778"]},{"name":"Sebastian Schelter","ids":["2180399"]},{"name":"Philipp Schmidt","ids":["50450500"]},{"name":"Dustin Lange","ids":["21505601"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3272005"}

However, these systems focus on the presentation of important, common information in news, but do not reveal different perspectives on the same topic. Thus, current news aggregators suffer from media bias, i.e. differences in the content or presentation of news. Finding such differences is crucial to reduce the effects of media bias. This paper presents matrix-based news analysis (MNA), a novel design for news exploration. MNA helps users gain a broad and diverse news understanding by presenting various news perspectives on the same topic. Furthermore, we present NewsBird, a news aggregator that implements MNA to find different perspectives on international news topics. The results of a case study demonstrate that NewsBird broadens the user's news understanding while it also provides similar news aggregation functionalities as established systems.","inCitations":["4294a07be5e6b1f83b5cdf6be9e91d9643fe498a","3582589436c243df65a5fa618efccd3f7e86152c","68ebd8721961630367a10e100179d799f761106f","667266ccdc6b88e703fa46bb2488ccfd084e7dd8","f191912b96a0b6fdbb23d2518d2e4512fdff332f","e0155fc93ab419a469ee127467fcbddd9a450998","9a325be2b39e60f9c4ad9aec9eb736ceac57a4e6"],"pmid":"","title":"Matrix-Based News Aggregation: Exploring Different News Perspectives","journalPages":"1-10","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3200343"],"entities":["Code coverage","Modified nodal analysis","News aggregator","Primary direction"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1bad3e9f15df77f06ae449bba17f9e85a3bb9187","21f6d1eb510bc3c4c91617d84a9d48b954f83b78","0669ec32ace971122351a120f57d05caa504a0b2","bf0659484b50f1083f7927768d4fc89ca3d6f10b","f1172b027daef2de1d5fbc2057d986cc65b6d938","d001c06816c9d893b21f9567e9ce007a577bf2a5","a735c3f3d759a0ed711d86358be195b12dfcd165","6a716a562d19ccb9f9fbaa3750e80a3c5fdb65aa","299a008d8221b572c25ccf581e723ababb364fbb","ec43d37aad744150af144d27a08b0b097607e712","04fa53cfb61af83163258b5c4cbe0883a3fb43e2","fdc279eddcd4ebdaa42a46bfa20a6aba8d32e597","6902ff693206b75ecf974b8a86713f0f1aa9e87c","c849e41faef43945fcb02a12bae0ca6da50fc795","86f86f7017ca11d4d849006b2938e6f02bfe16d9","6668f074320e543ac4d08d4bba2a4bf93a0982e4","7314be5cd836c8f06bd1ecab565b00b65259eac6","33e93ce8435c36337dfdc5f4481096fd88187c99","13e5f0c40c85ca8e01b3756963d5352358de7c29","6f36d32625da1618a02c9ec1cd2ba475d5d6e968","b87bf0986b2e9fe34a22ed0c19cfd32ed06857d0","c0ca71fea4b4d67ce48e52e9297dc28e0aa4503d","9a6422f980ac4775e7b92b26208cfc639bbd066a","64c22174a3a43c1224c88ba37eae6421a0086730","996978a9fe73a34906f2187301f0a0334cced862","0fcbde8009e831a2100dfc67e2115be2a4b02e7e","2abb9660637a260e5342c3e2c00abb07ab903978","4114029a160d7015754f784b272bc8355c23bca0","14b12181c378b851fe24251ca4e99ee414e2b137","4008d78a584102086f2641bcb0dab51aff0d353b","52cff37ea72cfe25eaea1c36a30dc8281bd8a700"],"id":"eb1363d78077e479084005b6672d8f3044807e25","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eb1363d78077e479084005b6672d8f3044807e25","authors":[{"name":"Felix Hamborg","ids":["3461253"]},{"name":"Norman Meuschke","ids":["2888110"]},{"name":"Bela Gipp","ids":["1761389"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JCDL.2017.7991561"}

This can encompass formulating and reformulating a series queries expressing evolving of different information needs. We believe that the next generation of search systems will see a shift towards proactive understanding of user intent based on analysis of user activities. Such a proactive search system could start recommending documents that are likely to help users accomplish their tasks without requiring them to explicitly submit queries to the system. We propose a framework to evaluate such a search system. The key idea behind our proposed metric is to aggregate a correlation measure over a search session between the expected outcome, which in this case refers to the list of documents retrieved with a true user query, and the predicted outcome, which refers to the list of documents recommended by a proactive search system.

Formalizing the key concepts of the DOM is a prerequisite for the formal reasoning over client-side JavaScript programs and for the analysis of security concepts in modern web browsers. We present a formalization of the core DOM, with focus on the node-tree and the operations defined on node-trees, in Isabelle/HOL. We use the formalization to verify the functional correctness of the most important functions defined in the DOM standard.

Big Data fundamentally challenges the classical notion of efficient algorithms: Algorithms that used to be considered efficient, according to polynomial-time characterization, may no longer be adequate for solving today»s problems. It is not just desirable, but essential, that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation. In this talk, I will highlight a family of fundamental algorithmic techniques for designing provably-good scalable algorithms: (1) scalable primitives and scalable reduction, (2) spectral approximation of graphs and matrices, (3) sparsification by multilevel structures, (4) advanced sampling, (5) local network exploration. For the first, I will focus on the emerging Laplacian Paradigm, that has led to breakthroughs in scalable algorithms for several fundamental problems in network analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. I will then illustrate these algorithmic techniques with four recent applications: (1) sampling from graphic models, (2) network centrality approximation, (3) social-influence analysis (4) local clustering. Mathematical and algorithmic solution to these problems exemplify the fusion of combinatorial, numerical, and statistical thinking in data and network analysis.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Scalable Algorithms in the Age of Big Data and Network Sciences: Characterization, Primitives, and Techniques","journalPages":"6-7","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3160602"],"entities":["Algorithm","Algorithmic efficiency","Analysis of algorithms","Approximation","Big data","Centrality","Cluster analysis","Clustering coefficient","Computability","Computation","Computational science","Exemplification","Machine learning","Numerical analysis","Sampling (signal processing)","Scalability","Social network analysis","Time complexity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["930001f394dc4862985da58137c78e7bc3018b0c","008ec875d8fbfabe6086b0f6cda4e874bd765167","215aad1520ec1b087ab2ba4043f5e0ecc32e7482"],"id":"8ba1c94fe1a8175aa29a116fdc6e0c93cf884cf5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8ba1c94fe1a8175aa29a116fdc6e0c93cf884cf5","authors":[{"name":"Shang-Hua Teng","ids":["1714796"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3160602"}

Such dynamic systems can be modeled as graphs that change over time. Even though considerable work has been performed on finding points in time at which a network notably differs from its past, little work has been done on characterizing or explaining such changes. However, in the era of big data where networked data are getting bigger and bigger, being able to summarize such changes is key for sensemaking and root cause analysis. To address this gap, we present a novel approach to summarize significant structural changes in large temporal graphs. Specifically, we propose an efficient approach to help the user understand sharp changes in the structure of the network by presenting to her only a summary of key subgraphs that contribute most to the change. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets with ground truth demonstrates both quantitatively and qualitatively the ability of our approach to accurately detect changes and discover \"important\" structures to succinctly describe the change.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"ASSIST: Automatic Summarization of Significant Structural Changes in Large Temporal Graphs","journalPages":"201-205","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091518"],"entities":["ASSIST (computing)","Anomaly detection","Automatic summarization","Big data","Data science","Dynamical system","Ground truth","Lexicon","Scalability","Sensemaking","Sensor","Social media","Unsupervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["224e457fde0e97a080ce2385496784ee9d193a02","05dbe031b635ab9572eed4ef88d8b0311a48b48e","2ef9255a5740f35b754dde050ec36f44db0f28ad","8c38fe60b3761e25ed2d2486c3a944674a3e9534","025e224cf0f12f772c7efba4f7c6b769a2bf298b","0c700847fa371cfe9b28f30eacf57fcd4243998e","49b2a1b9606c0ccb95a36895760fc91b8b830266","8034bff4fe646e003148d78c129385d7f8a42eb6","b25c668707b98db90f2ea1d8939f9c35c0c7ace3","7aa519d168af6b778f52b0f0e304d5076b7d2cf1","0bad381b84f48b28abc1a98f05993c8eb5be747d","2d08ee24619ef41164e076fee2b268009aedd0f0","45a916500ce98c8d018c13de4c1d5c53130e8a72","1d6320a672b866444737880cee8a980f5cca6864","5b660f6fb6b1277a5c8a311a7e688234cde909d9","24489085f90aa5d262c21ef66c33dabaf413667e","0accebcec4162bef5a304e562e5cce4181f2d207"],"id":"17514ed6b3a2289933fe10c52018d814eb781cfc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/17514ed6b3a2289933fe10c52018d814eb781cfc","authors":[{"name":"Charalampos Chelmis","ids":["2465749"]},{"name":"Reshul Dani","ids":["13018216"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091518"}

In traditional information retrieval models, on the other hand, terms have discrete or local representations, and the relevance of a document is determined by the exact matches of query terms in the body text. We hypothesize that matching with distributed representations complements matching with traditional local representations, and that a combination of the two is favourable. We propose a novel document ranking model composed of two separate deep neural networks, one that matches the query and the document using a local representation, and another that matches the query and the document using learned distributed representations. The two networks are jointly trained as part of a single neural network. We show that this combination or \u2018duet\u2019 performs significantly better than either neural network individually on a Web page ranking task, and significantly outperforms traditional baselines and other recently proposed models based on neural networks.","inCitations":["3941a1189989e75cea45716cbeb63239c79466fb","5f8d47c65be2b58be5e9cb6b0383a38941a84a63","554d1fc53b04da833f9c1515531bb14f925eb265","ebfcfc4d7183f912e23e52fecd7c72449da7c302","cafd68e16f94b2b363d7d64dcdb28baf6eaf06e6","498bd5c4a00e44b2b19446091e0987a31632251c","76c6da68ffe3bc00635fbe3d8d68374bac42f333","445a5d5f2a67e48b2c34a73cba46a1018e9d1c61","2b6c68e0cb1a6a6e4092cc335cc0110d3583e035","94daa0a8a86ca6a0e86ab8d056f638e33cdf8c03","260bc0544a9fb3db4aa2412ef7339cdc0008b82c","b78566b11ee1bcfe5c437b5b0d4541abb27d5289","8ecaff11e660cc225f390b1a07fe5c1918c9d4af","787a505cce232736cab9a236044bd3f3e4f0dffc","5ae5971d000b2be9c4cd883ca59a2f26af07887a","256a1b72030066dea0682abab25b156758a53e27","14a33be93ed24c5e947556f6b382135abe69fb11","18389e8a7b2ed0992bbbe5dc4683bad0d55f1453","aad41c3828185b8d3e89b73867476b63ad0b9383","b286e2164f51daf7e39613583c79c3e45cd422ae","4b69fbc425daf8f60f4dce42696b9b6d08d6c64f","fab5828ac72c3cf10b55b5819296a65baa4aca32","4736c3d6f33569e2a3fef2b6617d4b7ae782ce94","7b54c5bcd4f79e06b441dc650feb2cc581cd1f1e","de411ccc884f55a8527db7dbd232955a2826d397","8e4ce47c1e6a4dac9f6e58b1777c8ee8bdd9c53b","0635973c34750b02d64e0817057019b477f8b34b","fc3e56c23bf7c632b82b9c7b169641ad7f5412a4","cda4897c7a2a5f4fdf0a8d12f2032a723cbb8302","ea92512cb91050fe1cdd55f8ed5c302272303ffc","10cdb2f8943e2589673818e7f4d630464de94553","b6ef3817f795d4f5eb45255a2e0f77e164bf6701","bc72e44040d57e0b56ea0c648c19226d43989af9","06e7ba45e4def91c280360791031f2b24d9898e5","a01b81eb04b150f39ef102ac11ebdc2de1916946","c2a14a2eb9d30d2524837fe0a5400d40a8e9c70a","b335cd21f8570a31319e7faa63c795340be1d3a8","f9954113e8b701df4ba38f6d0da6656e52466bbf","32e7f0863e7c56cfced89abedaee46e2288bc127","e01afd8b7c12894fbe0d48fd87045d9b2ad4c5e3","1272e219612184aa64b61d1d5c714f1811fcd407","fdc2c7e418b8c78ed1412f72d4a2aab695a84f83","0af8eea643b0391fb552db4828d7706366ee546f","01d856741137d24743c22d5e54c482325ab8409b","3a835cc957139f9caf0b9ec93b0d1889f4ac2857","fc3384d631f5e2b2a9d66623d4d3e1d28b96dee7","12508df1c8c4bfd57d09fc4dc2b211f2a13063a6","432b36c1bec275c2778c66f9897f9e02f7d8b579","ad5d07e542a773820128c4da08ca4be18133cb92","3f26b7932ff73610e1fc2c5def42cf873a0e096b","dd0c8d73b23452f9492d45413b0455a2c5121d1b","ed73e48720cf1780fee1fe15536fde2f31edf914","ea738439b880ad033ff01602ea52d04b366d0d37","d5cad293e33eaa9961122737a1c9a162ebc7d0ca","c49281ca9240e9dfd458b196be57cf4bf3636771","0ed5d050c1a983bba0f3eb57cccb5701d9d5de1d","9814b183dd844bd8925625c395c2228626186107","6addf7afa7f26204df05638b60ff1f5905d0fe88","76f449e391ba7fe2428ca563dbd2a1f0cdb54710","edb0cf0ead3c55e6328bdc2ca8b0315acb9060c8","caa8b954566c9a97db0267b281d8a9843ecfac3d","e9f7ca5d4cf9b9aca2706ae67dc3de58d7ebf498","97a82c6a984a2ffb4a9d58b06229c379de590ecb","0bd17d682a901ad5d25e1aafbb10b7735f168a7b","3e37b7d4b60334ba083f60d69a73a8c251458d03","d8191c96a89bb843b5e422583246ec6464cad27a","53c6eab0dc9ac28d81b1a7a791df29a6493d792e","41a31fb17a9b1c5ee267dea43ee7e682bc07dae8","865f1f45b3dd8bbd1b92dc758be7e50a733a2e5b","0f9535512a9bc8414f86a2774b5e4d8b35a5036b","e643b04503d341432dccff0f567055c778fb1bb6","953ff89b61382263091ee78304577d145200a1ae","2e700355bce4d8637c5dd6656a77c8c67bcd0770","d2d7f9f2029ab66165dfe2f083b2160f2443eaae","7fdf8d0e4424a01d81707b9de9a18fda01013949","5091ee7158e105a7882eeb5f295d29e6cf1d77ec"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning

Sometimes, our task is not to train a model using those unlabeled/labeled data with missing value but process examples according to the values of some specified features. So, there is an urgent need of developing a method to predict those missing values. In this paper, we focus on learning from the known values to learn missing value as close as possible to the true one. It's difficult for us to predict missing value because we do not know the structure of the data matrix and some missing values may relate to some other missing values. We solve the problem by recovering the complete data matrix under the three reasonable constraints: feature relationship, upper recovery error bound and class relationship. The proposed algorithm can deal with both unlabeled and labeled data and generative adversarial idea will be used in labeled data to transfer knowledge. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Missing Value Learning","journalPages":"2427-2430","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133094"],"entities":["Algorithm","Experiment","Machine learning","Missing data"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"10225407c0bad5d641f4a281572c60c377bf0e33","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10225407c0bad5d641f4a281572c60c377bf0e33","authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Lin Zhao","ids":["4292453"]},{"name":"Chang-Dong Wang","ids":["1825101"]},{"name":"Kun-Yu Lin","ids":["5644670"]},{"name":"Jianhuang Lai","ids":["1750721"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133094"}

In this paper, we propose a hashing based deep learning framework called Discrete Deep Learning (DDL), to map users and items to Hamming space, where a user»s preference for an item can be efficiently calculated by Hamming distance, and this computation scheme significantly improves the efficiency of online recommendation. Besides, DDL unifies the user-item interaction information and the item content information to overcome the issues of data sparsity and cold-start. To be more specific, to integrate content information into our DDL framework, a deep learning model, Deep Belief Network (DBN), is applied to extract effective item representation from the item content information. Besides, the framework imposes balance and irrelevant constraints on binary codes to derive compact but informative binary codes. Due to the discrete constraints in DDL, we propose an efficient alternating optimization method consisting of iteratively solving a series of mixed-integer programming subproblems. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our DDL framework on two different Amazon datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DDL over the state-of-the-art methods regarding online recommendation efficiency and cold-start recommendation accuracy.","inCitations":["296831a95aa306e3d3409d482439d7827c19cc46","f1cfe756a3c7992279a5fc1d72f274560160ef33"],"pmid":"","title":"Discrete Deep Learning for Fast Content-Aware Recommendation","journalPages":"717-726","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159688","http://net.pku.edu.cn/daim/hongzhi.yin/papers/WSDM18.pdf"],"entities":["Binary code","Cold start","Computation","Deep belief network","Deep learning","Experiment","Hamming distance","Hamming space","Integer programming","Interaction information","Linear programming","Mathematical optimization","Recommender system","Relevance","Sparse matrix","Window function"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ced6d0b0257273850af38a3757151264beefdd73","bf75d4e8b9a2b21653dcfbfb8183d10a77474091","d7205a5ecd9a3555a5eee5e31079451d965cc999","6800fbe3314be9f638fb075e15b489d1aadb3030","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","2375f6d71ce85a9ff457825e192c36045e994bdd","c1375bfb196c2011309e30586d9a1ced893bfbaf","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","a4e11b7b0a89949bd993c0932f85c40fc34b3e39","71fbbc1675780f2f945073f9d92c09b8d76f80f0","184d2fcb8baa49e6ae64a6619ed469f2fdc762b3","0cd032a93890d61b9bd187119abee0d6aeb899f7","3f1e54ed3bd801766e1897d53a9fc962524dd3c2","52c0876b25a5721c4c6930d94d5308f0779734ec","5ae98595bba7eb02ba95df2989871bfa86fb02cf","026050f71175d235f3f91ca0e99e994c00f9b5a6","32fc17245616dc4e20e69160ad19ef2a39199568","91ffac42e3416f0a0a542b2d981636b02271fdbb","d11aa7da36aedc28bd6951eaf7356dd62392f315","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","031854648e0688c1bfc991e7597e54947928fb74","0788fb1109b1db8c72776005c9c0af926a278017","add2b5e24d8aa1986d3854bd2208327b0c00648e","141487cd6d32f6916bdcb029ac8159eba44e23de","01dd5af05830e96211e5445b65c96abccf8d0445","12d0c11d546d91e776a170898ebf3a38c010695c","e2b7f37cd97a7907b1b8a41138721ed06a0b76cd","7bac5931cc3f27c4bd71333a7d3c7546db0545d2","4672f24bf1828452dc367669ab8a29f79834ad58","7b33f9b7cb34f374758ae0fcf3ccebed099e490c","ac06fa167a82868636110a678da0cfa4ec57d445","a4675a6429efba8ad337c3e39293d407699842f6","5c534f0c84c8d4cdf8618645043da421b7682753","373f76633cc1f6c7a421e31c989842021a52fca4","64c871cd7e0af7e1aeb94d98c6214eb8d8e8b989","c862baf4a671acc8bcb892f59b83491a72cbca34","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20"],"id":"50fcb416fc3e98cb454bb908753e3c598cd8bbb4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/50fcb416fc3e98cb454bb908753e3c598cd8bbb4","authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhang","ids":["36124320"]},{"name":"Hongzhi Yin","ids":["2416851"]},{"name":"Zi Xuan Huang","ids":["2484050"]},{"name":"Xingzhong Du","ids":["2742322"]},{"name":"Guowu Yang","ids":["1805650"]},{"name":"Defu Lian","ids":["1862782"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159688"}

Although recent research has provided important insights into TSS, these scams have now evolved to exploit ubiquitously used online services such as search and sponsored advertisements served in response to search queries. We use a data-driven approach to understand search-and-ad abuse by TSS to gain visibility into the online infrastructure that facilitates it. By carefully formulating tech support queries with multiple search engines, we collect data about both the support infrastructure and the websites to which TSS victims are directed when they search online for tech support resources. We augment this with a DNSbased amplification technique to further enhance visibility into this abuse infrastructure. By analyzing the collected data, we provide new insights into search-and-ad abuse by TSS and reinforce some of the findings of earlier research. Further, we demonstrate that tech support scammers are (1) successful in getting major as well as custom search engines to return links to websites controlled by them, and (2) they are able to get ad networks to serve malicious advertisements that lead to scam pages. Our study period of approximately eight months uncovered over 9,000 TSS domains, of both passive and aggressive types, with minimal overlap between sets that are reached via organic search results and sponsored ads. Also, we found over 2,400 support domains which aid the TSS domains in manipulating organic search results. Moreover, to our surprise, we found very little overlap with domains that are reached via abuse of domain parking and URL-shortening services which was investigated previously. Thus, investigation of search-and-ad abuse provides new insights into TSS tactics and helps detect previously unknown abuse infrastructure that facilitates these scams.

However, the direct usage of explicit social relations may lead to an inferior performance due to the unreliability (e.g., noises) of observed links. To this end, the discovery of reliable relations among users plays a central role in advancing social recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to adaptively identify implicit friends toward discovering more credible user relations. Particularly, implicit friends are those who share similar tastes but could be distant from each other on the network topology of social relations. Methodologically, to find the implicit friends for each user, we first model the whole system as a heterogeneous information network, and then capture the similarity of users through the meta-path based embedding representation learning. Finally, based on the intuition that social relations have varying degrees of impact on different users, our approach adaptively incorporates different numbers of similar users as implicit friends for each user to alleviate the adverse impact of unreliable social relations for a more effective recommendation. Experimental analysis on three real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method and explain why implicit friends are helpful in improving social recommendation.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Adaptive Implicit Friends Identification over Heterogeneous Network for Social Recommendation","journalPages":"357-366","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271725","http://www.public.asu.edu/~jundongl/paper/CIKM18_IFBPR.pdf","http://net.pku.edu.cn/daim/hongzhi.yin/papers/CIKM2018.pdf"],"entities":["Cold start","Experiment","Feature learning","Feature vector","Hyperlink","IBM Notes","Machine learning","Network topology","Personalization","Recommender system","Social network","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8c4032d08b142ed39a79a441e5f585a82d0c5f69","0e492e9eec9630502e11941a12b638ac1a552d69","a0775fab3b20f2dc0ac2f2626552d046b6afc225","c421bec956c05b52f11af0de6e46323b0ee6abb9","24fafbc64fddff8bad9699343871f5ae5100011e","91a530f5cee222c6d95983086fcbc006ae95e010","b0743ad11614cf1f4861dc2eca0e4a264b528990","57bf84b70746c195eaab1ffbc0102673704cc25c","a2399a7a0b39ade27f9edf605075f3fa3877e2c9","736e8deabcae7e2f9eb6c41a1bfae1b5270a8dbd","1070ede2b5ad3972dfbfceb751aca28a3480bb9a","0fc3b3bb73c330edce53f5c82eed6cacc49ead11","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","7536e758f07d3dda1f381b70556828c5f15889a5","c73287153c0a50102a40800c1ada626a410c63cc","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","afa9445af28b3d04610a45cf1297a6fb373d6078","37295f6ef72b8e5f69862033a287e38e7e064b42","3e10498198c9f5d4ca0abebe04a5847874c9be24","0e29731a89fff8046ca72e65d22994c425b8a844","d1f4460091422514b590bea1247f0ca197133b76","cc9244f89438c0d69806a067fdffc0cbffc1f1c6","7b33f9b7cb34f374758ae0fcf3ccebed099e490c","4cc352fa9dc7fc87389ce95e6779a2603f4ee87f","20dc1890ca65e01856f31edf10126c2ad67e9d04","236c4613771834d3cfb43c450305ade107813198","0aa2a4d259433016ebc899c496faea03c024c0bd","1b8dc814a7384285a52bc005bc54a3b5c87b219d","873c4035268fb41f36555cd9f4b90423c174dae9","8d978ba9e72b5039c9562d1441e523c31639aac1","05097fbb9c8b03f1f706a641ed19bf173f455ed9","666d6f8031adbbd8911fb5628b32b28e34b93e07","68aeb585d0da8cdb433e94d6a531622d025a98e3","c862baf4a671acc8bcb892f59b83491a72cbca34","3c9ca63c51f0884ad3e8e02287ce85a83ed393ad","a65210ed6313a22be6f4126edb806bcd1400c1c7","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20","612ab2c052c11c9f797234481dbbbdc82bc7cd68","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","c20fce1384e8569cb15ab40dd09e36b1088a14d0","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8","d20208d3acbe5c085977f35e2730746860974f12","a751e18d02b25173b07ac76daaa712f3d3e48517","cbb0c8eb820219cae04d08aa6089df10dde8274b"],"id":"8168b2653606966230055c82de6e7b5abcb59bb0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8168b2653606966230055c82de6e7b5abcb59bb0","authors":[{"name":"Junliang Yu","ids":["28584977"]},{"name":"Min Gao","ids":["48082691"]},{"name":"Jundong Li","ids":["2040455"]},{"name":"Hongzhi Yin","ids":["2416851"]},{"name":"Huan Liu","ids":["2365866"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271725"}

Existing work has studied how locations can influence information needs, focusing on web queries. We explore whether or not location information can be helpful to users who are searching their own personal documents. We wish to study whether a users' location can predict their queries over their own personal data, so we focus on the task of query suggestion. While we find that using location directly can be helpful, it does not generalize well to novel locations. To improve this situation, we explore using semantic location: that is, rather than memorizing location-query associations, we generalize our location information to names of the closest point of interest. By using short, semantic descriptions of locations, we find that we can more robustly improve query completion and observe that users are already using locations to extend their own queries in this domain. We present a simple but effective model that can use location to predict queries for a user even before they type anything into a search box, and which learns effectively even when not all queries have location information.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Semantic Location in Email Query Suggestion","journalPages":"977-980","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210116"],"entities":["Email","Information needs","Information retrieval","Personally identifiable information","Point of interest","Web content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9b1823898a89e2be3a60f5d4b26bd771496ae5c9","58a01d225f6e40ddb243daf93416a5c5c8a56fb2","143305bb976a7bdbdd904d5134368a72e29374ba","c029baf196f33050ceea9ecbf90f054fd5654277","eda93a4a22f4718a2fb53bcf454c55bd6c01b0ae","86f21e7ba4f9fdd281804dba9c0d67126692254a","1a101cb8adad86a076a8e7686b513fa3395a0e5a","d7a7166cfa3d2e71f761a4424f9b5e9b23ca903f","8e5f1448c34cfd78b85ef2601ddc2fda84fde101","0db1506b228e92d0c8cca2a01df475cfcb0c3eba","1fead8639d4b3dd33c529c32a4ddd1dbaa8fd916","6e953a5caa643ef2e310473b680ef23262bb80ce","160ec59f2eb9def5cca00f6c1bf198d13fb8b6a7","46cb32eec63d625e32c0ce99744c4c256a9a13fa","27ae5272e7d4c260b1af931c225b5b92cbc7e26d","379f601a467e2bdb9ac4f51f87734bb60eb1701f","3832b5bbb8d751da15cdfa466f85cfc684b16580","0bae016641fbd2d53d672435b51805e05a864edb","5b635d7ba72e96f1ba0d0f6b11f57e9461149aed","2127c33a6c9a8cd0f6297c3d04fd02dbebe97334","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","da43effe313a12d389a6659f63046d4551e3b815"],"id":"1f8b5b8a58bd58c2c094dfdcafa97dbf87eec77e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1f8b5b8a58bd58c2c094dfdcafa97dbf87eec77e","authors":[{"name":"John Foley","ids":["49156472"]},{"name":"Mingyang Zhang","ids":["38026005"]},{"name":"Michael Bendersky","ids":["1815447"]},{"name":"Marc Najork","ids":["1763978"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210116"}

Two related issues might affect the performance of MIL algorithms: how to cope with label ambiguities and how to deal with non-discriminative components, and we propose COmpact MultiPle-Instance LEarning (COMPILE) to consider them simultaneously. To treat label ambiguities, COMPILE seeks ground-truth positive instances in positive bags. By using weakly supervised information to learn data's short binary representations, COMPILE enhances discrimination via strengthening discriminative components and suppressing non-discriminative ones. We adapt block coordinate descent to optimize COMPILE efficiently. Experiments on text categorization empirically show: 1) COMPILE unifies disambiguation and data preprocessing successfully; 2) it generates short binary representations efficiently to enhance discrimination at significantly reduced storage cost.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Compact Multiple-Instance Learning","journalPages":"2007-2010","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133070"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Binary code","Categorization","Competitive learning","Coordinate descent","Data pre-processing","Document classification","Experiment","Ground truth","Information retrieval","Mathematical optimization","Multiple-instance learning","Preprocessor","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["802ffab8e64821c2f3fdd05b4daa6f63df9ae706","0dcdb8815e85f575144a8877c130e73034ab092a","026050f71175d235f3f91ca0e99e994c00f9b5a6","7b3f39094a99d037c989ec0a9702f0dd05898d2a","5d982c10ba2ad3d5d10986adeb79b5b64b15be32","89dd979043cbda9f3964c31acc69873c63040552","51fdf00e8180a3a361064a30f922337b824b8437","3447fe054f6af70403cfc39b4d21076337a71128","090de5bb250fde879c694a5c4026de648b9da2ca","64372501affd8571db20dc606b0146a76c266303","465894827db154dc08eaebb2256665a2eb90f285","6d6a0ca30ca8a77a86ec4f6182252c5ae7f27fc1","2d53f86dae40f0995e9950c1aa9d27b584d3544f","0dcf477dd3519afc5a9789b979e1a888392ac444","93c03ff9421c49b74c234d6486e8884b6d744b54","7483db36ea8b84046dd9d91c8eb6f4844458940d"],"id":"d3bfb493520c80d596571e20e06a5cdfb87baaed","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d3bfb493520c80d596571e20e06a5cdfb87baaed","authors":[{"name":"Jing Chai","ids":["47708050"]},{"name":"Weiwei Liu","ids":["49663634"]},{"name":"Ivor W.

In these platforms, which tend to host tens of thousands of unique audio advertisements (ads), providing high quality ads ensures a better user experience and results in longer user engagement. Therefore, the automatic assessment of these ads is an important step toward audio ads ranking and better audio ads creation.\n In this paper we propose one way to measure the quality of the audio ads using a proxy metric called Long Click Rate (LCR), which is defined by the amount of time a user engages with the follow-up display ad (that is shown while the audio ad is playing) divided by the impressions. We later focus on predicting the audio ad quality using only acoustic features such as harmony, rhythm, and timbre of the audio, extracted from the raw waveform. We discuss how the characteristics of the sound can be connected to concepts such as the clarity of the audio ad message, its trustworthiness, etc. Finally, we propose a new deep learning model for audio ad quality prediction, which outperforms the other discussed models trained on hand-crafted features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale audio ad quality prediction study.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Predicting Audio Advertisement Quality","journalPages":"153-161","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03319","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159701","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03319v1.pdf"],"entities":["Acoustic cryptanalysis","Audio signal processing","Deep learning","Display advertising","Display resolution","Online advertising","Online music store","Spectrogram","Streaming media","Transcription (software)","Trust (emotion)","Usability testing","User experience","User profile","Waveform"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4ccb0d37c69200dc63d1f757eafb36ef4853c178","19dacfb6f55a7189b04e4be925eaa6e5d2fde799","a8b615f03232ac665c8787d8883513f73be0b04a","342d0e5798f4b69673f8ba5460a84f889c527d9b","1aada21a3991814f978f42e0c60c6b81a64fd624","1b65af0b2847cf6edb1461eda659f08be27bc76d","c3cf66f57f7e38c9087a4eb328957625eb78515e","b72fbc0f1796ab91b6d1103e3c9a720e386ee6d9","564985430ff2fbc3a9daa9c2af8997b7f5046da8","0b722e56e396681bbb3a932cae547ec57ec0e53f","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","1bc072002d97808340b312b69427baf2dc9fcb8e","5dd9d884f4bf117b595b99ef5e3818ab5f516412","053ae4112d2a640b2cfc385c0c5e4a5739666d55","714544b7cf35a3b8bdc12fb1967624a38f257a42","99d03dc3437b5c4ed1b3e54d65a030330e32c6cb","75dd41322a55cfca831b47aef8b822ea4f093c3e","ab21e24201e6117ee6879a58624b655a52e9dd54","b9588a8840f9f195c03847d9e3a95ac63d2bc5f2","3791151a0bc42d4d4d64530ef7ad9e850afdc147","efcf6e0c73b4b70ba0851fa8eb39e91162fcaad6","3d64d8d66df09eaeccfaae9d428ea8204a4b86ce","83174a52f38c80427e237446ccda79e2a9170742","b3be0e608822bf564f5edb5c0e7d066afae1f11e","0f746310beef54e4b009c0ea961dc55fd078a37d","efffc22b2b314aa7d240dd7d827b20df5030a459","fe8520e7e0ef8d3c22c45f0439244f42ba81e78d","4cef10ea66e40ad03f434c70d745a4959cea96dd","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","dc06c6ea4c08b1f1d890cbc9786e9133a7342814","34ddb4d6b98a45b24b9645b5c52b1d3424ba24f5","c4806efffa95a727006d2d6284240f2c181f75ab","a977808a4a56d6adf0cd0bb011638ed8d2d97b99","33b3d9864a0f776afdc2d57453a4acc0a9f2519e","7a04451cb5b8a7c78ad53d36be1db7724ea09842"],"id":"8bb0e218dbb51265230280b77f4619da209897b0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8bb0e218dbb51265230280b77f4619da209897b0","authors":[{"name":"Samaneh Ebrahimi","ids":["8612044"]},{"name":"Hossein Vahabi","ids":["2507979"]},{"name":"Matthew Prockup","ids":["2227419"]},{"name":"Oriol Nieto","ids":["1899151"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159701"}

However, previous studies have shown that the performance of retrieval models varies for different query lengths, and it usually degrades when query length increases. A possible reason for this issue can be the extraneous terms in longer queries that makes it a challenge for the retrieval models to distinguish between the key and complementary concepts of the query. As a signal to understand the importance of a term, inverse document frequency (IDF) can be used to discriminate query terms. In this paper, we propose a constraint to model the interaction between query length and IDF. Our theoretical analysis shows that current state-of-the-art retrieval models, such as BM25, do not satisfy the proposed constraint. We further analyze the BM25 model and suggest a modification to adapt BM25 so that it adheres to the new constraint. Our experiments on three TREC collections demonstrate that the proposed modification outperforms the baselines, especially for verbose queries.","inCitations":["65cdce9211fdc76fe4ef236f8f8bb6ed5459a288"],"pmid":"","title":"Improving Retrieval Performance for Verbose Queries via Axiomatic Analysis of Term Discrimination Heuristic","journalPages":"1201-1204","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080761","http://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1276"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Experiment","Heuristic","Information retrieval","Okapi BM25","Text Retrieval Conference","Tf\u2013idf"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["45d35d65b344e07349e91f6d4b40196fc7a92acc","4fe9f8c5982f5ff7fb76ae3432a45d5328a732d9","2c68c7faa89b104b78e2850dbade5a81f0743874","773270b7e62bbe24f9a8f74386c1d84c88098caf","a907e5609bb9efd1bafb11cd424faab14fd42e4a","1ac4b9e48c395f4c91028176b2a6f45716716e00","a41c1831c7fdec49adfd2273e468d70956e5f379","ae0067338dff4e6b48b6b798776ec88a6c242aae","fb211aa3aff6976f5137bedc43c2a43226404cad","1dea28a58295504ca87f531a2648414ba811d24d","c21a069ee11caa56af4d86b49bc2149c24decbb7","9c72a32a9b9ae7c0d450e787ce9c49a654b2018d"],"id":"ce7f9b2c6566f21056d0d4bf06a0a172fd1064f1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ce7f9b2c6566f21056d0d4bf06a0a172fd1064f1","authors":[{"name":"Mozhdeh Ariannezhad","ids":["3429661"]},{"name":"Ali Montazeralghaem","ids":["3375353"]},{"name":"Hamed Zamani","ids":["2499986"]},{"name":"Azadeh Shakery","ids":["2887988"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080761"}

Combatting phishing is thus a top-priority, and has been the focus of much work, both on the academic and on the industry sides. In this paper, we look at this problem from a new angle. We have monitored a total of 19,066 phishing attacks over a period of ten months and found that over 90% of these attacks were actually replicas or variations of other attacks in the database. This provides several opportunities and insights for the fight against phishing: first, quickly and efficiently detecting replicas is a very effective prevention tool. We detail one such tool in this paper. Second, the widely held belief that phishing attacks are dealt with promptly is but an illusion. We have recorded numerous attacks that stay active throughout our observation period. This shows that the current prevention techniques are ineffective and need to be overhauled. We provide some suggestions in this direction. Third, our observation give a new perspective into the modus operandi of attackers. In particular, some of our observations suggest that a small group of attackers could be behind a large part of the current attacks. Taking down that group could potentially have a large impact on the phishing attacks observed today.","inCitations":["4a8ff4db783ff480a50303e3531e155e30c25b2e","897c27ba43a0d470b1b4e949239c7b5088b8cac1","080aefaae4269cfb5ca69f3497136caee6c54e64","f622e8af6746bc23c934a44bc2fee796ff59e505","20069c2fa1ef4dac1ac2d1f6242acf108a36d794","b7de52fe93fc9cd11b17b5174aeb9b2f5b83eff8","6fc7d41dc285c40d5b32b8179746713b414167a7","649a0bd3dc0d89e94f7176d3c34e0ce4ffb67fe0","7cfcce2a3731e6f359b67e2683b4e37572f17dbb","00af60ee8750f8547229759f3529addf93ce468e"],"pmid":"","title":"Tracking Phishing Attacks Over Time","journalPages":"667-676","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/595f/4c71a2346235bb503f7a4e7500a1b4dd9945.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p667.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052654"],"entities":["Phishing","Sensor","The Fight: Lights Out"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["edcb5fd36883e94b1e8a598be4e23ad44579d3db","6d7f9304cf5ae6b27376ba136b8dfc681a844993","6493b5316d5e9f5874456aa6e0d21452f2398a68","19c4ea5b7533327a9653f31e2c38de21b47fe5c2","a2f666c899d6ac0090c12acf7dc998d39e75f98f","29b9ddd192340f2eb04150cee512c48adbfe5fef","6bba847f25124aea6e14231f13f63a3f0a4f9c33","3c8bf504ddc7db1829466b6e9da5251025dd48f1","2b877d697fb8ba947fe3f964824098c25636fa0e","54e8d9ce1b539b32c78fe43e9fab459a5a03e2d4","e769c99f63f526ec88e74d9683bdbc12a6e55359","414927a4a02727e1842d1c4f388af9d0a25ecf08","d445eed5ab725be542a026e6c1f0078ffce1ef5f","5938ca3697f9c55bd28b7d2a0d5460cf99ffba50","eb7a59e381648a0eb8e1eadd98513a3afcf55aa5","6f3f0ff81994f2566ba29a67448a8096ec52e3de","399a795b7a53196dd75329e1442ee692394c836e","0a2c261f6712f9fa5cf50079c5342fd770cf4f03","654e16b4391d74fc6dc05a07bc36d0a60a2aba2f","8188a3bc844d1ea707fa476edadfc99d4c38e3e3","ff89414661c0e4bc7a8f19da3729bfe013ceec52","330603a55480ef73ad40d49469d0b5f3bdb38ffc","c4722c3428753210b8be9fb8277f530a4e31acdb"],"id":"595f4c71a2346235bb503f7a4e7500a1b4dd9945","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/595f4c71a2346235bb503f7a4e7500a1b4dd9945","authors":[{"name":"Qian Cui","ids":["32175625"]},{"name":"Guy-Vincent Jourdan","ids":["1680531"]},{"name":"Gregor von Bochmann","ids":["3356921"]},{"name":"Russell Couturier","ids":["9562120"]},{"name":"Iosif-Viorel Onut","ids":["1798425"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052654"}

It is composed of a number of different activities, such as designing the experiments, analyzing the data, and writing the manuscript. Information about the contributions of individual authors of a paper is important for assessing authors' scientific achievements. Some biomedical publications contain a short section written in natural language, which describes the roles each author played in the process of preparing the article. In this paper, we present a study of authors' roles commonly appearing in these sections, and propose an algorithm for automatic extraction of authors' roles from them. In our study, we used co-clustering techniques, as well as Open Information Extraction, to semi-automatically discover the most popular roles within a corpus of contributions sections. In total 13 roles were discovered, three of which (paper revision, literature review, and interpretation) are not described by existing author role taxonomies. Discovered roles are then used to automatically build a training set for a supervised Naïve Bayes role extractor. The proposed role extractor is able to extract roles from the text with micro-averaged precision 0.68, recall 0.48 and F1 0.57.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Who Did What?: Identifying Author Contributions in Biomedical Publications using Naïve Bayes","journalPages":"387-388","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3197026.3203907"],"entities":["Algorithm","Biclustering","Cluster analysis","Experiment","Information extraction","Interpretation (logic)","Naive Bayes classifier","Natural language","Randomness extractor","Scientific literature","Semiconductor industry","Test set"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7e50c1bcf75641b3d12b65830bb1a431defbd3b7","31134217eede9343991832824505a64b3b39a6f3","15781e091a6ca2a1448bf9255f51691c7bc98cf6","3532a3c8924dc0c001cdf744358ddd105ef72efb","256043cc6aa645cb67a9fa11d8258c07be39c3a5"],"id":"d77297b190b6a2ca5ced232a603066c6114dd6c5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d77297b190b6a2ca5ced232a603066c6114dd6c5","authors":[{"name":"Dominika Tkaczyk","ids":["1695024"]},{"name":"Andrew Collins","ids":["1945165"]},{"name":"Jöran Beel","ids":["1781377"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3197026.3203907"}

Despite being intrinsically related, the analyses performed by these tasks differ, and combining their output may result in NLP annotations that are implausible or even conflicting considering common world knowledge about entities. In this paper we present a Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) model that leverages ontological entity classes to relate NLP annotations from different tasks insisting on the same entity mentions. The intuition behind the model is that an annotation likely implies some ontological classes on the entity identified by the mention, and annotations from different tasks on the same mention have to share more or less the same implied entity classes. In a setting with various NLP tools returning multiple, confidence-weighted, candidate annotations on a single mention, the model can be operationally applied to compare the different annotation combinations, and to possibly revise the tools\u2019 best annotation choice. We experimented applying the model with the candidate annotations produced by two state-of-the-art tools for NERC and EL, on three different datasets. The results show that the joint \u201c a posteriori\u201d annotation revision suggested by our PSL model consistently improves the original scores of the two tools.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"An Ontology-Driven Probabilistic Soft Logic Approach to Improve NLP Entity Annotations","journalPages":"144-161","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d009/905b1ad0528bf6a8bc4c16d8427da4e0e0f8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://dkm-static.fbk.eu/people/rospocher/files/pubs/2018iswc_research.pdf","https://dkm-static.fbk.eu/people/rospocher/files/slides/2018iswc_research_slides.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_9"],"entities":["Commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence)","Entity linking","Named-entity recognition","Natural language processing","Probabilistic soft logic"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d966fe48a2690babd180e13ba86ca5477d2a1444","2b9cd09b949b7e69933d18ae408397e803987151","db6c932acb3fb8dda8b0701f617da7798e583eef","24ff26b9cf71d9f9a8e7dedf0cfe56d105363cd3","534678954bca9194349b1b233191418900d09c53","f1797171acde204d4fc939940da220489cfe3b8f","dfceb1948784ae92bcd2710250aea7e48097409f","e81239c37a5e007d561edc3a5120a8684be26e29","8a2d52191644e79ac83fc8bd0d200e89d747c456","4f410ab5c8b12b34b38421241366ee456bbebab9","7d326328ae77aec4c431ed0fcf90d4c22cb27144","5d544dea9765311432d96307b182a80d5fa25874","67959b3d3d4c28d94dadd74c3a1740f7b33fefd6","4fa0d9c4c3d17458085ee255b7a4b7c325d59e32","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","28eb033eee5f51c5e5389cbb6b777779203a6778","e8177476a3c62278d3b5dd3a99b9bb417c7d449a","3bbfc62fc13ca27c6e58e42167a6aef593a1365e","3965b1d15b2de806b758082ed86b41b01cb6728a","7fe65a296757d03241370a21d08fe0d9ae2b381e","27b2c6ba78c48af54239366f346b57227cccb666","de6b2ad0c13ee5fca9db38a60bdd9798fb1ffa31","2bcd45dd5fd6e22e642e6ce9016d101feb393617","9520f78f645893b688ee42f6773ed649f7ed5dac","96c7763eca174fa22e463443a819023bffee384d","ba2a2884dc831c79d4d26b675872b8633ad3a81d","2c7dc111f850dc1f87fdf92ec3be290d2beaa8c6","6559dc04c019893920ef0408e767d7e11c619e6b","196d7e0a43587b0216c47a1ddb8cb1875aa1c1d0"],"id":"b9d7a9674df434de0e1bf90e990ce337fcada052","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b9d7a9674df434de0e1bf90e990ce337fcada052","authors":[{"name":"Marco Rospocher","ids":["1766782"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_9"}

{"doiUrl":"","venue":"International Semantic Web Conference","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2018,"paperAbstract":"Universal schemas are a remarkable approach for solving relation extraction, in which new facts are extracted by jointly learning latent feature vectors of entity pairs and relation types through matrix factorization models. However, in free word order languages where surface form predicates do not fully reveal the characteristics of a sentence, universal schemas cannot be constructed in the same manner. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a novel expansion of universal schemas, dependency-path-based universal schemas. Our model uses shortest dependency paths and entity types instead of surface form predicates. For verification of our model, we constructed and evaluated a universal schema in Korean with a combination of Korean DBpedia and Korean Wikipedia distant supervision data.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Universal Schemas Using Shortest Dependency Paths for Free Word Order Languages","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b258/a28fecc918524ecdf92b1dd0bcf4e6ed8e43.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-31.pdf"],"entities":["DBpedia","Relationship extraction","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4823725dfd0b1b93397530a5726e834c6c1ece42","52b5eab895a2d9ae24ea72ca72782974a52f90c4","498bb0efad6ec15dd09d941fb309aa18d6df9f5f","8c68094a59dd2f24415082c53464abf45387f0bb","6a0d978a3fd2b74e24f95ddf9b630e83a060ef24","030f6132f6b6b3336ce9b0b29c5ac4c1e368b7dc"],"id":"b258a28fecc918524ecdf92b1dd0bcf4e6ed8e43","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b258a28fecc918524ecdf92b1dd0bcf4e6ed8e43","authors":[{"name":"Jiho Kim","ids":["3339219"]},{"name":"Sangha Nam","ids":["2357073"]},{"name":"Key-Sun Choi","ids":["1709062"]}],"doi":""}

In this paper, we study temporal hashtag usage practices in Twitter with the aim of designing a cognitive-inspired hashtag recommendation algorithm we call BLLI,S . Our main idea is to incorporate the effect of time on (i) individual hashtag reuse (i.e., reusing own hashtags), and (ii) social hashtag reuse (i.e., reusing hashtags, which has been previously used by a followee) into a predictive model. For this, we turn to the Base-Level Learning (BLL) equation from the cognitive architecture ACT-R, which accounts for the timedependent decay of item exposure in human memory. We validate BLLI,S using two crawled Twitter datasets in two evaluation scenarios. Firstly, only temporal usage patterns of past hashtag assignments are utilized and secondly, these patterns are combined with a content-based analysis of the current tweet. In both evaluation scenarios, we find not only that temporal effects play an important role for both individual and social hashtag reuse but also that our BLLI,S approach provides significantly better prediction accuracy and ranking results than current state-of-the-art hashtag recommendation methods.","inCitations":["37af9e0220612c98751bad10221e024fc5f067ab","799ce596f10e3154bf012c62cc8019c6f53d4460","635762a70e6cc76e7ea9a3370f5c1ac47584e42d","d804a3251ca025f9381690056b1c81e2fdffc628","f78e99d024239a91b79bca7577882ba29a9ff7c4","8f56a65f08e2155575c65880bc21c102eb764a8b","216805564f9259c8e328f1d68bf29b9cd27cbed3","ec895f753a37f2f4371de2d5d630fb52a76455c3","4f830f86accab5bb7912aade535f7ac3fc50c703","69b59628c0be73114be836320ee970cfa0297cbd"],"pmid":"","title":"Temporal Effects on Hashtag Reuse in Twitter: A Cognitive-Inspired Hashtag Recommendation Approach","journalPages":"1401-1410","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1401.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01276v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01276","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052605","http://dominikkowald.info/documents/others/2017www_slides.pdf"],"entities":["ACT-R","Algorithm","Business logic","Categorization","Cognitive architecture","Hashtag","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4c775488cbb7557b1e20d43d3fb7c6c286eeb7d2","188f4d9b9d580d0432056b760b3372ec83543d1d","00f58387c4fb1e761d4cda9fed915bb23ca3d674","4696a1a38f70432e7c23e0e2ac17427c063625e3","3d890a2ec766f9ec146285ababde8d92ee6a099f","fa350c2ce6e57c42c74f763f502a30ab4677924d","1216d109ddf8f774d5a188cdfddacef8748691df","8a222ce7128cd4c526edad5d2effe8fb759c27d5","329c5ee99db8ce14d2b68d9a3ca760e1619d19c6","7fdbb7b01bb55bed2a98cac2edd45b83749924db","7087498bf7a31342a52b768831f515e0aec7c46e","239c6ebf6172f8f34e9d103ca1c10056d532be09","0706356c9ab6014d6b04577d38289ea8328291a5","97eee7ad3b9bfe264283f3af1304cd0daddea23f","55c8f17b88ff6253d589aa4bd1b731159de6a50c","0a01c66cb4bcc835b823d4b160af2fcee4c3bbee","0e73dbe0988ab8636940559e6bbd572118855926","919000e100bb98c1a2580693be2a33cd60ad429c","727fa258f778060fa5667d7605c9a2a48f29ed3e","0a5feab178ddb179a37f3a19b69b4a956ed797d8","27099ec9ea719f8fd919fb69d66af677a424143b","54180669e0d56dd77ff55b4b409ffd832bf931c0","165c428fec7d3aac4ab6e2c9d285af92883b643c","9df432ee253045d67926280bcbbb5bfd1390378c","2e9f3ad574a76dda8a3f2266f2d810a00c5e7916","0da372e60d1c08e1687eccc27df0723cbbd66e54","0871c7ea6df1342594dbfe3f892ea454f7573732","38097f2792c53d237db4cf4d94ccf90bf094a86c","1fc3873f1eaddda17425e7d87b5b9c4597479881","2a6887a127cc5e778b7027ed105e0622b18b3b81","07b45ef5d7088f8fc9dac7daee772d86141076f5","017372aec4b163ed6300499d40e316d2a0a7a9dd","d4649ae8490735598f2c9002949590c30567f3e2","0a89fd20a3912049149a3358b65fd8a2421c445d","058ada9d78c689e03ea898008e2bcebf69910d4f","45cf7ea736444e2fefc0ccbaf598abd110fabf0d"],"id":"91e40035f76646fee44691a050bcfa8685813c16","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/91e40035f76646fee44691a050bcfa8685813c16","authors":[{"name":"Dominik Kowald","ids":["1803040"]},{"name":"Subhash Chandra Pujari","ids":["2252806"]},{"name":"Elisabeth Lex","ids":["3124784"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052605"}

However, two recent trends are dramatically changing the box»s role: first, the explosive spread of smartphones brings significant computational resources literally into the pockets of billions of users; second, recent technological advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and in particular in speech processing led to the wide deployment of assistive AI systems, culminating in personal digital assistants. Along the way, the \"Web search box\" has become an \"assistance request box\" (implicit, in the case of voice-activated assistants) and likewise, many other information processing systems (e.g. e-mail, navigation, personal search, etc) have adopted assistive aspects.\n Formally, the assistive systems can be viewed as a selection process within a base set of alternatives driven by some user input. The output is either one alternative or a smaller set of alternatives, maybe subject to future selection. Hence, classic IR is a particular instance of this formulation, where the input is a textual query and the selection process is relevance ranking over the corpus.\n In increasing order of selection capabilities, assistive systems can be classified into three categories: Subordinate : systems where the selection is fully specified by the request; if this results in a singleton the system provides it, otherwise the system provides a random alternative from the result set. Therefore, the challenge for subordinate systems consists only in the correct interpretation of the user request (e.g., weather information, simple personal schedule management, a \"play jazz\" request). Conducive : systems that reduce the set of alternatives to a smaller set, possibly via an interactive process (e.g. the classic ten blue links, the three \"smart replies\" in Gmail, interactive recommendations, etc). Decisive : systems that make all necessary decisions to reach the desired goal (in other words, select a single alternative from the set of possibilities) including resolving ambiguities and other substantive decisions without further input from the user (e.g., typical translation systems, self-driving cars).\n The main goal of this talk is to examine these developments and to urge the WSDM community to increase its focus on assistive AI solutions that are becoming pertinent to a wide variety of information processing problems. I will mostly present ideas and work in progress, and there will be many more open questions than definitive answers.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Call to Arms: Embrace Assistive AI Systems!","journalPages":"1","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3160603"],"entities":["Artificial intelligence","Assistive technology","Autonomous car","Call to Arms","Coat of arms","Computational resource","Email","Gmail","Hyperlink","Information processing","Machine learning","Personal digital assistant","Relevance","Result set","Smartphone","Software deployment","Speaker recognition","Speech processing","Web Services Distributed Management","Web search engine","Web search query","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"dcb32510f496c0f1e0bc63ae4d326ac41ee987c3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dcb32510f496c0f1e0bc63ae4d326ac41ee987c3","authors":[{"name":"Andrei Z.

Due to the cost and time limitations of measuring the actual execution time of each application on SSDs, it is difficult for users to determine the best SSD for their most commonly used applications. In this paper, we propose a framework of estimating the execution time of an application IO trace (i.e., a query IO trace) on a target SSD without its real execution. Our framework is based on the observation that if two IO traces are similar in their IO behavior, their execution times tend to be similar when executed on the same SSD. The performance of the framework is evaluated through extensive experiments on real applications. The results show that our framework is accurate in estimating the execution time of an IO trace on SSDs.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Framework for Estimating Execution Times of IO Traces on SSDs","journalPages":"2123-2126","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133115"],"entities":["Automated planning and scheduling","Baseline (configuration management)","Digital footprint","Experiment","Flash memory","Microsoft Windows","Run time (program lifecycle phase)","Socket.IO","Solid-state drive","Tracing (software)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["17453ddcfa6b29ab3d6d277fe88e204bb2ae23e4","46d76119315b7f999ff52f97bbc7f078fe037aad","9e67a37cbe1380af6d1480c3d5353bf370146059","3b8a4cc6bb32b50b29943ceb7248f318e589cd79","4ce1d4579369a4f5773a1172dce87718bdb49ada","39c61999f2d164fa5bcecd16968a337ccb02ce2c","7a6987f6b0b47d8c6a39cccebb2d3c9566e45054","7019d566d10fcdb836aa338c344de4f0ed2131b6","2363eb25371b4be662a3ac5c51a14297b0139412"],"id":"2ce125a70ff4a3d619cd50f8fd913df0aa6c3367","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ce125a70ff4a3d619cd50f8fd913df0aa6c3367","authors":[{"name":"Yoonsuk Kang","ids":["34716434"]},{"name":"Yong-Yeon Jo","ids":["2424383"]},{"name":"Jaehyuk Cha","ids":["3205781"]},{"name":"Wan D.

The majority of customers, however, do not respond to rating surveys, which makes the result less representative. To understand overall satisfaction, this paper aims to investigate how likely customers without responses had satisfactory experiences compared to those respondents. To infer customer satisfaction of such unlabeled sessions, we propose models using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that learn continuous representations of unstructured text conversation. By analyzing online chat logs of over 170,000 sessions from Samsung\u2019s customer service department, we make a novel finding that while labeled sessions contributed by a small fraction of customers received overwhelmingly positive reviews, the majority of unlabeled sessions would have received lower ratings by customers. The data analytics presented in this paper not only have practical implications for helping detect dissatisfied customers on live chat services but also make theoretical contributions on discovering the level of biases in online rating platforms.

Nevertheless, fine-tuning deep models in a new domain still requires a significant amount of labeled data despite expensive labeling efforts. A valid question is how to leverage the source knowledge plus unlabeled or only sparsely labeled target data for learning a new model in target domain. The core problem is to bring the source and target distributions closer in the feature space. In the paper, we facilitate this issue in an adversarial learning framework, in which a domain discriminator is devised to handle domain shift. Particularly, we explore the learning in the context of hashing problem, which has been studied extensively due to its great efficiency in gigantic data. Specifically, a novel Deep Domain Adaptation Hashing with Adversarial learning (DeDAHA) architecture is presented, which mainly consists of three components: a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning basic image/frame representation followed by an adversary stream on one hand to optimize the domain discriminator, and on the other, to interact with each domain-specific hashing stream for encoding image representation to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two types of losses, i.e., triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input triplets and adversarial loss to maximally fool the domain discriminator with the learnt source and target feature distributions. Extensive experiments are conducted on three domain transfer tasks, including cross-domain digits retrieval, image to image and image to video transfers, on several benchmarks. Our DeDAHA framework achieves superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Deep Domain Adaptation Hashing with Adversarial Learning","journalPages":"725-734","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209999"],"entities":["Adversary (cryptography)","Artificial neural network","Benchmark (computing)","Binary number","Boost","Code","Convolutional neural network","Cryptographic hash function","Deep learning","Discriminator","Domain adaptation","End-to-end principle","Experiment","Feature learning","Feature vector","Triplet state"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0cf6d01642ae8d0b415095c4b57e400775cfbee0","3842ee1e0fdfeff936b5c49973ff21adfaaf3929","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","024d037d46ae933c7e12fd16af61953c7161773a","0171bdeb1c6e333287be655c667cfba5edb89b76","595d0fe1c259c02069075d8c687210211908c3ed","d3f587797f95e1864c54b80bc98e957da6746e27","b8ebda42e272d3617375118542d4675a0c0e501d","1c734a14c2325cb76783ca0431862c7f04a69268","e33b1833b2d0cd7b0450b22b96a567a59c9e4685","081651b38ff7533550a3adfc1c00da333a8fe86c","808759ebf565ae5abb58a93daff31f097d69dfe5","223319a93dcf3912bbc1e5f949e5ab4d53906e62","22d90529f2f4eab4b4d7108fc10d51e7a8bcbac9","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","6184ddbe780cb934f036b04dd1d28226b6bcbcce","b67406eee0f5339979484b740ce969868da99ef9","54dd68126a0aa0d5c3a5be15a86d3e423c5fc62c","454cb7c8f4e9c777b1062e71cf3bef717b941657","ba9acc0c32e9164522488cafe9ad321588f848d8","5d90f06bb70a0a3dced62413346235c02b1aa086","0c60eebe10b56dbffe66bb3812793dd514865935","02227c94dd41fe0b439e050d377b0beb5d427cda","35756f711a97166df11202ebe46820a36704ae77","7b3f39094a99d037c989ec0a9702f0dd05898d2a","07117994f0971b2fc2df95adb373c31c3d313442","6de2b1058c5b717878cce4e7e50d3a372cc4aaa6","722fcc35def20cfcca3ada76c8dd7a585d6de386","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","7340f090f8a0df5b109682e9f6d57e4b8ca1a2f7","0ec905e3d2751674dcfde4f8d9882c88eb07a1ff","12d0c11d546d91e776a170898ebf3a38c010695c","54dd77bd7b904a6a69609c9f3af11b42f654ab5d","aa4d911ec4b714fb81f9ddff1ea1d455b085167c","12d0cf8ae5ffe1b89345e1dcead22be592d844b2"],"id":"f27fd21273e3c31f166fad08c53f1fe27caf2490","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f27fd21273e3c31f166fad08c53f1fe27caf2490","authors":[{"name":"Fuchen Long","ids":["34779291"]},{"name":"Ting Yao","ids":["2053452"]},{"name":"Qi Dai","ids":["9227981"]},{"name":"Xinmei Tian","ids":["40434674"]},{"name":"Jiebo Luo","ids":["33642939"]},{"name":"Tao Mei","ids":["1724211"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3209999"}

Different from existing approaches that rely heavily on feature engineering, we propose to use network embedding approach to address the problem, which can automatically represent nodes into lower dimensional feature vectors. However, there are two major limitations in recent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose embedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of these approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the heterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two folds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author identification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to the heterogeneity of the network.\n To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and path-augmented heterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded as vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly trained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend the existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in heterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The guidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both explicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection. Our experiments demonstrate that by using path-augmented network embedding with task guidance, our model can obtain significantly better accuracy at identifying the true authors comparing to existing methods.","inCitations":["a949cc2ee57366532fb757e7264afef47688a58f","e6f36e5db4de408fbbf29c39c94c16d51382b19a","8c5c7fe6d59c58e39692ab2bc9d1c95f3644be7a","55905e637d4c06cd16e331ac9417d93d896472fd","a9474a0947a0fee13e43ca95b53ecbf245270c52","f5dc944089829300f0039da85c7460077ceeecbc","3787be42476764eccd0d3285f8476110bb3c648b","8f04689f96b0e97c026bd6c298b61d1f662a0d44","a02e30bb596af7aa3e797c8da7773e7121c229a4","1f9fada6b0f2a15fd1dc3e9c77220f6800ef989c","cca14499a4d7ec1870fbc955d14952d25ed138d8","60718ff912b372afb048e9d93eba450ed6b6d715","a003ab6661c9d5eeb99a8a4941a840746165443c","5440e2a537c4847ee40735da562b94a094aa84fe","682e6605720556305b99ad1379ad9b00a3dd1891","fc4491f209112c24806616d56b691b32580417cf","87a4819783849db2019bdeaa062b4f7c995b1007","a360a526794df3aa8de96f83df171769a4022642","963aacf5cc4753985c03de69150f9fb4e929ca5a","1465ec0921762002d781caa6a06ba7dd4ab9c6fd","4d5f4d6785d550383e3f3afb04c3015bf0d28405","01ec9be11a01f9035802456de83c0b0a72634541","30aebd4ada05f737f45f29229ca40155bd909cfb","df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","5ec39dcadbfa096592ac811679c3e1eb8ddff7db","a1590adb6e186161e731088edc6834344dfc2508","0f1df0f930a44eaff845799956ca6a27bebe1513","0efedf8a4d8119e8ffe8294aab7c1c832326a46e","160a2a61058b119f95812621d67d92585fed1ad5","e151f74bc90fd3873e045e6c44e2c54e003f2017","7a186b52649d5d1792b7f863dab928451fc2e2ac","4446bc827b773e66f5cc36d23a0e579c70d54508","a156ed9df0115adf1f579ae8718f8df2eca4ca91","18a4db56faec17a958355e7c93c3839ae7ab1a81","59b96dcfe7a19cb98ce00506ec474e3b2330784a","a0775fab3b20f2dc0ac2f2626552d046b6afc225","1216bc7fb8a9ebe66f48286b61eca226c68ca2f8","eb2e5f285e5a6c7a1ca9e6c60d725d5145145a26","25c4c49d197a7a2026fcbe0884d6ea00cf1b84f4","85b3193e329b7017cde6856b5cbbd3ff6e19f8f9","efe19c8c26537dfaa445843ac30661d72dd7f301","c0c0990b84a350d5efde8d3b2cb2636b6b57c21c","4476fccb0f52df514783989e8c248c975d21ba0e","bb0c3045d839f5f74b9252581cf45faa8b3b5f7e","7c28b81dff1899e5a148ff57888faacc9945ab22","96a3dc5169c095c154fc873d6655903618336448","13688d7535f82b49e9530987582fe9ca6ecbab88","ecc245240e46e9402b8a4dc77d5b02f0b8301349","ca81c46ef3c8d0a134a93a6ec7a3650e87443957"],"pmid":"","title":"Task-Guided and Path-Augmented Heterogeneous Network Embedding for Author Identification","journalPages":"295-304","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02814v2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02814v1.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018735","http://shichuan.org/hin/topic/Embedding/2017.%20WSDM2017%20Task-Guided%20and%20Path-Augmented%20Heterogeneous%20Network%20Embedding%20for%20Author%20Identification.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02814","http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/papers/WSDM17_Chen.pdf"],"entities":["Embedded system","Experiment","Feature engineering","Feature vector","General-purpose modeling","Semantic network","Unsupervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","33efd3ecffca21efaf9d1469b7dc3d2a72a0a05e","20dc1890ca65e01856f31edf10126c2ad67e9d04","6d7634c402c6c728a4657b44173689f7c0e75cae","24fafbc64fddff8bad9699343871f5ae5100011e","1cbc96351256c085699c2401564878547ad76f28","2be2f5a313792627ae1760c4a308da5ed164d962","05d6e0185bcb48d396fe778ceedb2078e37e72ef","2cbe0ba73d02aabbeefedf841203219796a551b7","20739c96ed44ccfdc5352ea38e1a2a15137363f4","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","6d05606dcd52c044ad59f729656dbd9fcabe9671","86d401b968e8590626d96919cd69887df850f86a","a3d86c97ffc750dc98ad6717cbc63979926e97a2","3c8c92a42ef33c849fdd539a80716bf1a3eead3a","a6ef4b4c0ede3318ee8d5105401a855a499ad0d4","84893123d016ff4808c3d4fef654bad7365055e5","cf839be160797b63648db5f0a3c24309f6aa407f","10f272220cbca311c8379a72f9d5ba387b18c437","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","41285e207f2bfb861d3aee7c1557a9b8525745af","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","8cfffe4f41b37c7325ba912f98254075602934c8","dca7134972244108bb98e5a9138042e055a2ac6e","b7b9196227cdf2f55bd5b6fac373c9127ccb7b57","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","032935f090274b1487e7b15dc89922e2bd8109f4","400f6f4304b1c12efb22acf7e80a1784015cb23a","839104964d04c505a827ae854e1251271968c7f7","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","3eaca435527a765572ed04acd06ba512faac89eb"],"id":"13c40b32b9f35c8d24a5c00ec16a88382aaf07fe","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/13c40b32b9f35c8d24a5c00ec16a88382aaf07fe","authors":[{"name":"Ting Chen","ids":["48129107"]},{"name":"Yizhou Sun","ids":["1792614"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018735"}

Apart from the discovery of foreign key relationships, INDs can help perform data integration, integrity checking, schema (re-)design, and query optimization. With the advent of Big Data, the demand increases for efficient INDs discovery algorithms that can scale with the input data size. To this end, we propose S-indd++ as a scalable system for detecting unary INDs in large datasets. S-indd++ applies a new stepwise partitioning technique that helps discard a large number of attributes in early phases of the detection by processing the first partitions of smaller sizes. S-indd++ also extends the concept of the attribute clustering to decide which attributes to be discarded based on the clustering result of each partition. Moreover, in contrast to the state-of-the-art, S-indd++ does not require the partition to fit into the main memory- which is a highly appreciable property in the face of the ever growing datasets. We conducted an exhaustive evaluation of S-indd ++ by applying it to large datasets with thousands attributes and more than 266 million tuples. The results show the high superiority of S-indd++ over the state-of-the-art. S-indd++ reduced up to 50~% of the runtime in comparison with Binder, and up to 98~% in comparison with S-indd.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Improving the Efficiency of Inclusion Dependency Detection","journalPages":"207-216","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271724"],"entities":["Adobe InDesign","Algorithm","Attribute grammar","Big data","Cluster analysis","Computer data storage","Data science","Database schema","File binder","Foreign key","Mathematical optimization","Query optimization","Referential integrity","Scalability","Sensor","Stepwise regression","Unary operation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b7ce42a4968a6dcb27276b0ab7d98727f5b27f5d","6733d561eb0ffa6b69c305a4a657ba0aa8d0039e","050820253d11ecc87f8d95e88a4c6cde84259cdb","d77ebdc3d34b22d293144ee00ae6295250919165","e1ece6551ffebe3ab977ef8c8e2ee5cd5eae5d07","f6ea0cf09dfb05f6dd3aa47b977a294bb84c1276","8e3125142dcd6fa14e12786d85262d7d2cee6571","95cfad7618c2ebb2cbe994e3ad89b7576ed48a8e","8e884e35148a1d0b27bd677cb4dd7ee96fc2049b","ea4c2d571992c24fd3a0a001ca7012b8ecf4a98e","c5f67f828aedaf01e42a239144881de6fc4ae12f","4cf40a18955e5b79eb256666ee571fafd599b76d","0bffe203ee8e49d74d669d95fb2d414edb835b9c","13478f525ae0e91717569bddb705479744c4c62c","d1b88238df7b3618674fbe45f1e153f601c331df","ff8238bb5aaca6710da0b0eeda5b28d2907d9874","5679848496dd027e9d84d9219e3a2f70ccbe1259","0b8e332aeeb5657c13ec3dc153e3dd7325ff9bb0","f9be92d0c6201ea7ced13477e974d41f7f6534f9"],"id":"63b3c02e3d0c91db3184574e51f77e1fa9968717","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/63b3c02e3d0c91db3184574e51f77e1fa9968717","authors":[{"name":"Nuhad Shaabani","ids":["2514764"]},{"name":"Christoph Meinel","ids":["1708312"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271724"}

In most existing research, question-code pairs were collected heuristically and tend to have low quality. In this paper, we investigate a new problem of systematically mining question-code pairs from Stack Overflow (in contrast to heuristically collecting them). It is formulated as predicting whether or not a code snippet is a standalone solution to a question. We propose a novel Bi-View Hierarchical Neural Network which can capture both the programming content and the textual context of a code snippet (i.e., two views) to make a prediction. On two manually annotated datasets in Python and SQL domain, our framework substantially outperforms heuristic methods with at least 15% higher F1 and accuracy. Furthermore, we present StaQC (Stack Overflow Question-Code pairs), the largest dataset to date of ∼148K Python and ∼120K SQL question-code pairs, automatically mined from SO using our framework. Under various case studies, we demonstrate that StaQC can greatly help develop data-hungry models for associating natural language with programming language1.","inCitations":["917a8155b0494b92c6e3a08d9e6cfecc8bf4454f","86026a95ad99d6e594ee7de1527c6dd807901d94","a9d240d911e338e6083cee83570c10af6f9dafb8","b1fdbca1cd92e0d88895917e73bc692ec2b3bccd","429b65937d4922578a81e1f0ef5aeab7361ae36b"],"pmid":"","title":"StaQC: A Systematically Mined Question-Code Dataset from Stack Overflow","journalPages":"1693-1703","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e4d9/f20bf98a644425ada80157a8a19adaabf61b.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09371","http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/docs/StaQC-www18.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09371v1.pdf","http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~yao.470/paper/StaQC.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09371","http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~yao.470/slides/StaQC_slides.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186081"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8b8d4c0284f26d5e4ce08c85f98fd453762ab26d","37acbbbcfe9d8eb89e5b01da28dac6d44c3903ee","007034976b81f4fc62b6336944bd09ecd2bce4b6","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","612ec8d4d8a4630c4823b6b6bbab0fd283b13125","7d9089cbe958da21cbd943bdbcb996f4499e701b","02df3d50dbd1d15c38db62ff58a5601ebf815d59","0aedae19e94d76520cb92932b6506389799051e2","111501ce052a6f4f323214f081b26f04528207b4","3807a517403cfc7ed67fdfea64baf62b9948bcfe","5e0c0f1bf0ce526a7d4be0114974e81fbaa50560","a60b213b7488bd9f13d1b8fa9ab5139c941241d7","0cf3c51ae91d39febe273e6258f4d6fb72bfd791","24c223b3ee1b3198a021a2dcbf437136c80442ae","1be16d8c557b15cdf2db9e7eb4453f2274fd60af","1967ad3ac8a598adc6929e9e6b9682734f789427","2e65d19edb5afbf04c3d47d43fc89da30060223c","9e463eefadbcd336c69270a299666e4104d50159","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","0f3b8eba6e536215b6f6c727a009c8b44cda0a91","180bd651a4b7c4b5e2026db45a3532d3e8052661","17f5c7411eeeeedf25b0db99a9130aa353aee4ba","25a26b86f4a2ebca2b154effbaf894aef690c03c","713f73ce5c3013d9fb796c21b981dc6629af0bd5","27e1dbe9f7c71cd6cc1b0357f49aef497e572d09","cffb63b897d39ac687f7327e0b8a727e260cca19","ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649","eb310dbab25525c959c7d942643c0063607719d9","49512270b39636375880d611d7b2192d324f4ba6","d1a29be037c4a912f7909ae52de174868b42f9e3","0d58a913f4ef36f23ae324445a2b22d5723486cf","3d376896a9aa01a71455880e033a27633d88bd6d","1b1df9f75ee6f27433687dad302387f811dab64d","0faccce84266d2a8f0c4fa08c33b357b42cf17f2","1f8a99790dd9124d528a718e55a0b27683685c77","0788fb1109b1db8c72776005c9c0af926a278017","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","2cb8497f9214735ffd1bd57db645794459b8ff41","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","a478ee2db9f8bc1b896dab96191e55e3d1d964b9","c8d0e13de2eaa09a928eff36b99d63f494c2f5ec","493ecb754c8c772e1e1f91e4330e631116e8ba87","585bf9bf946b4cd4571b2fe6f73f5a7ba9a3d601","198df6b331b90d4b4f8acb82889a742543f331a0","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769","d953987d9173c8d88f80e32d340d0df68dafa2e2","4aae9e4fba739e4711b9433b196042df533e9757","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e"],"id":"dc030c2e55b266c029356a54bb444b7d9b1f2abc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dc030c2e55b266c029356a54bb444b7d9b1f2abc","authors":[{"name":"Ziyu Yao","ids":["3366595"]},{"name":"Daniel S.

Real-time notification pushing on text stream is of practical importance. In this paper, we formulate the real-time pushing on text stream as a sequential decision making problem and propose a Neural Network based Reinforcement Learning (NNRL) algorithm for real-time decision making, e.g., push or skip the incoming text, with considering both history dependencies and future uncertainty. A novel Q-Network which contains a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer and three fully connected neural network layers is designed to maximize the long-term rewards. Experiment results on the real data from TREC 2016 Real-time Summarization track show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Neural Network based Reinforcement Learning for Real-time Pushing on Text Stream","journalPages":"913-916","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3077136.3080677"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Artificial neural network","Long short-term memory","Real-time clock","Real-time transcription","Reinforcement learning","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","bb8af4ef931dbf4b1c59522c355f03746cc2c2fb","667fb84bfca10bec165f9e2cca3e21f5e4829ca7","11d6a1859c07bf840cea050a634df600b8471f87"],"id":"e84901c2de20f7fd5ff1bed1d04a63c1b6ad40a8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e84901c2de20f7fd5ff1bed1d04a63c1b6ad40a8","authors":[{"name":"Haihui Tan","ids":["36484109"]},{"name":"Ziyu Lu","ids":["34716662"]},{"name":"Wenjie Li","ids":["1749930"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080677"}

Ingredients, flavors, and nutrition information become strong signals of the taste preferences of individuals and civilizations. However, there is little understanding of these palate varieties. In this paper, we present a large-scale study of recipes published on the web and their content, aiming to understand cuisines and culinary habits around the world. Using a database of more than 157K recipes from over 200 different cuisines, we analyze ingredients, flavors, and nutritional values which distinguish dishes from different regions, and use this knowledge to assess the predictability of recipes from different cuisines. We then use country health statistics to understand the relation between these factors and health indicators of different nations, such as obesity, diabetes, migration, and health expenditure. Our results confirm the strong effects of geographical and cultural similarities on recipes, health indicators, and culinary preferences between countries around the world.","inCitations":["edbc233b4a8e9163c1b94dc3e0badb2c94ed700e","c4c235b5fe30f1c78b5835754d79bea0d14f3f7b","b1c96ea4523f82be01c9110e6c2b25a383631bc1","be3e8d535dae36a620d311b0d6865f78b3a51afd","ed3f51e7e0cdab48dd0d50218ee1cd8b5e3f0ded","959536fe0fe4c278136777aa54d3c0032279ece3","ba2b4f9272753995ba8d3a6f3ab93974ab16b9b2"],"pmid":"","title":"Kissing Cuisines: Exploring Worldwide Culinary Habits on the Web","journalPages":"1013-1021","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e444/94a1a94d2fc858c1668c64333e95bcabc72b.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08469","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08469v2.pdf","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfamus/papers/www17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3055137","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08469v4.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08469v3.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1013.pdf","http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/www2017ingredients.pdf","http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Stringhini/papers/cuisine-www2017.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08469v1.pdf"],"entities":["Database","System migration","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3476fb2ee7ddc50441fc94d39ed3a294cca65772","f22c490b4c3709d56a22c1ba3c056512d55e66ae","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","315a061bf865e25e27c245f1b1db2ce75b740d57","9a227b95e43f1547b7b5fb5057ca807e4b44efee","d9257516b752131b1f05a75092779a1332fb6918","8729441d734782c3ed532a7d2d9611b438c0a09a","1e118fb31253dde4a36719a02a14601490d57021","48e83c965a20994b4568031bce2305f94baee9d9","3b5b77110609259f23f6eb2a3985e265ac0359ac","2afd645e3ea20fac3062e7529d1df181f69565ef","4a733055633db751fc76dad7d897f9bc74f2dd48","364fb0677a5d7083e56c0e38629a78cb94836f53","70588d5549b4d48b181cf66da74296564878ae10","1a3aad9128ebfdc11bec90af4aec8fe0b4dd3c36","c29fc13ceb79741fd753b032e76a90550e0d57d8","5fbaecc6940351175a12c843ed5a43e3cb9c3346","28527492e49132f6dbc9172865173b3138b63278","c0202ea8e0b5c0da16c40e45c3431aa788c533f5","892b6402ba0c42843254242faff64813c6e4d15c","5d59376df36eb92425d864e9d775830ab1cdafe1","00ba9519cae9d204ec6e9e8133b8bd73145a1fc0","30f9ce2feb3b08b79859beefdbef00e98f9c0003","ade23517b674d6ec665fb54da4c178b655993e09","b82baacfe57fdfc4c9d85e46b1794244778921bb","07a593cb857bdc1024cc6f080a3f4f1d4e9665f7","1b15527e1186e5548cf2d43a016e4e48a070fc72"],"id":"3b2de965eb60b8e38dea997920b700f0f7d26199","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b2de965eb60b8e38dea997920b700f0f7d26199","authors":[{"name":"Sina Sajadmanesh","ids":["3432632"]},{"name":"Sina Jafarzadeh","ids":["40055253"]},{"name":"Seyed Ali Ossia","ids":["8201306"]},{"name":"Hamid R.

Major challenges include non-reproducible research results, dealing with noisy data, and answering many questions such as how many recommendations to display, how often, and, of course, how to generate recommendations most effectively. In the past six years, we built three research-article recommender systems for digital libraries and reference managers, and conducted research on these systems. In this paper, we share some experiences we made during that time. Among others, we discuss the required skills to build recommender systems, and why the literature provides little help in identifying promising recommendation approaches. We explain the challenge in creating a randomization engine to run A/B tests, and how low data quality impacts the calculation of bibliometrics. We further discuss why several of our experiments delivered disappointing results, and provide statistics on how many researchers showed interest in our recommendation dataset.","inCitations":["6ffb167fbadbd9513fe812e7695a1b5154739111","914ba7469cd69f24362a44a4d243748c52905ec8","a4ef0d5af701894b602a2634f4393c12ecf3565a","a49b5c0b0bc0e7f1901096794f5735f520245566","d47691cb1367e1b0ed9f75997232fea31b325340","875d75e6ec03ed0a2a8033cee2f467b14f1c9605","796f14676676a6eb5d237f47d1bcc9c88276d3ef","cc06615e9d5e12476ecedfd124bab89fdbd8e19c","b9873bbc3ba9545851bd40a7fbce6fc3706a74d4","e5e989029e7e87fe8faddd233a97705547d06dda","c348bb32251997177f5cef9bd8960edb76a61351"],"pmid":"","title":"Real-World Recommender Systems for Academia: The Pain and Gain in Building, Operating, and Researching them","journalPages":"6-17","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c425/c7d84356bb827bb5a26d66497b24e5201fd8.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00156","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1823/paper1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00156v1.pdf"],"entities":["A/B testing","Bibliometrics","Data quality","Digital library","Experiment","Library (computing)","Pain","Recommender system","Signal-to-noise ratio"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["83069020d9381a9cfa7664cdc6a121f792ece1c6","abcda8f0f6afb28237e248be9ab6da6c9058600e","8008b56382a030a546caeb0667a5fcd1e5c15767","2d7e6b988ed60f8b20a34aa690a9124069ad1039","074468eae8b2bf4215ace0260fd0f37769003fab","03b64997f2b1ca02f6e32c349fa8961a9d5dd702","a61918ca6970a2343ffaf571c7aa280ba160182f","8761a7dd475cf81e43bb9ea40035a02b788bd35a","ae15acaa631806701f2fc0b35959dab74d5ef8f7","04c5905921a51558c87dc3e1f6028fee545b1347","05d5dc9bbc03276506fd314671364d4fe0dc5f37","16c029e8f4bc3b662b0ad89d15dd57ff567f3726","7b7ca7d38dba1cd23f48ac9f36b0a20aa646b57b","18b609308c0ae531ee96f3d50f96679ad091c85f","6c1ef15daba3fbc9a0cf56761520d2618615d9f8","6a1f9632b978a5cc2b8a276f22451a4db54d1f78","20dbeabd3ad6c260b97313866746f0639e234cc8","1e46cf51b3077a9af80633b77d93fa7da9800e74","9740e73b0fe1885aaa3f77e3c1d03f8e86d842bb","019f40374a5a55da078f0a66c652d951a7f44860","b41b641daf967130a61ded4a979444ffbdc8bd88","22ab6804c228693079554c529f8862069112780c","14f62f6e623eec005a0ddfa77af5d7ca05bb0f88","276ebc620a8976026bd2d03582b9ecfa3738d43c","2ce95f84bd186955411b8630ce36cd7abe0c6fcd","b9873bbc3ba9545851bd40a7fbce6fc3706a74d4","091931a01327acbe441be1a2c9f3ae8ba55aea60","4207b6d76d1f7168c5dd6e396d8e4659803171f4","fc7c632a89b6c90a899446af1d4cb30690e8d6cf","01eecac575549b4143457b9874f9d48bcdbb2aac","a1f8c785cc066662d0cd6ddff1a4610d87558cf4","2fdf42983944da142b6b99d2f736a8fd785c88c8","1acf208cb20af3987d2684534c709086cefc9d23","53b771d350e84874fca44430702a6ab61288ed32","9916eef828b461051d4c0b090e82aef8d4855485","e4863866dbc4ac0e7197d27f61956e6f67aaed20","24cad70c8d723afd403e03fa08f49e090c4facb6","0d5fcff17d6c85d387a386559e00d1bad1ddbe08","ee251742be5fa89c8130f78923390b3af20fde43","48611c6021fdd76e8a908b650d92b9a2bd0006c8","357de87d5d1b61cde840dda9619a941fc81ba5a6","1899e73827d02b5e6ddb96e4e83a89cf00ea78c7","b6b6d2504fd57d27a0467654fa62169cc7dedbdd","58239fa0ffa7f66d58f8da0b6251b0f396d45364","8aba78cbad57ab6a8680fdff06504bd1a21f1a74","dff3cb04786c9833fb3dd2514f923deb2532326e"],"id":"c425c7d84356bb827bb5a26d66497b24e5201fd8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c425c7d84356bb827bb5a26d66497b24e5201fd8","authors":[{"name":"Jöran Beel","ids":["1781377"]},{"name":"Siddarth Dinesh","ids":["10159266"]}],"doi":""}

At the same time, researchers are depositing a broad variety of other scholarly artifacts into emerging online portals that are designed to support web based scholarship. These web-native scholarly objects are largely neglected by current archival practices and hence they become scholarly orphans. We therefore argue for a novel paradigm that is tailored towards archiving these scholarly orphans. We are investigating the feasibility of using Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) as a supporting infrastructure for the process of discovery of web identities and scholarly orphans for active researchers. We analyze ORCID in terms of coverage of researchers, subjects, and location and assess the richness of its profiles in terms of web identities and scholarly artifacts. We find that ORCID currently lacks in all considered aspects and hence can only be considered in conjunction with other discovery sources. However, ORCID is growing fast so there is potential that it could achieve a satisfactory level of coverage and richness in the near future.","inCitations":["f4eca32f12e35d28db48e5c293bea43bddb79837"],"pmid":"","title":"Discovering Scholarly Orphans Using ORCID","journalPages":"1-10","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3200355","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09343v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09343"],"entities":["Archive","Portals","Programming paradigm"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["83ad5ef5f3fa7ced6b6b0a80d674fa506a11b690","d754e1f7e25ce7d2eec8eced18a741ccee15ae60","df04a20569aace455fa8b03de4600d3cd99f587e","a49b9ea3a80bad7080a1e29dd7af317153d0e747"],"id":"51532e007938eece1f4e19a2b91b1e3e4e13c01e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/51532e007938eece1f4e19a2b91b1e3e4e13c01e","authors":[{"name":"Martin Klein","ids":["50006448"]},{"name":"Herbert Van de Sompel","ids":["8050194"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JCDL.2017.7991573"}

Some prior works have exploited GPS, Wi-Fi or bluetooth to collect data, in which extra sensors or devices were needed. Other works utilized data from smart card systems. However, some public transportation systems have their own smart card system and the smart card data cannot include all kinds of transportation modes, which makes it unsuitable for our study.Nowadays, each user has his/her own mobile phones and from the cellular data of mobile phone service providers, it is possible to know the uses' transportation mode and the fine-grained crowd flows. As such, given a set of cellular data, we propose a system for public transportation mode detection, crowd density estimation, and crowd flow estimation. Note that we only have cellular data, no extra sensor data collected from users' mobile phones. In this paper, we refer to some external data sources (e.g., the bus routing networks) to identify transportation modes. Users' cellular data sometimes have uncertainty about user location information. Thus, we propose two approaches for different transportation mode detection considering the cell tower properties, spatial and temporal factors. We demonstrate our system using the data from Chunghwa Telecom, which is the largest telecommunication company in Taiwan, to show the usefulness of our system.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Public Transportation Mode Detection from Cellular Data","journalPages":"2499-2502","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133173"],"entities":["Bluetooth","Global Positioning System","Mobile phone","Routing","Sensor","Smart card","Telecom Gold"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a52bd8b0173ecce2aa9f62c074db30a7dd13da9c","681241a4a50ef6725d5906df359e64e19b90b016","8133e18b26311d312fe657f6157bd3fbadcfe4b4","25bee59815aa84c6692962ef645877393af6ac5f","17956aad5f6cb58e95e4812de910fe332cffdca7","641ea1876ff9eab3d701bf92044debc32e0be4d2","78e18dc9fbecc1b44f9ecf51ab63a0863066fa85","de41d0768b46868f627f209592274c4a10f5fe4f","765fe2dcc1e6d57f3a7edcd0994353530af6dc8f","d65123dbb9d9f82ffaf1d90f6eeb99b07fdef268","e4ef6521a675395b0e78c6ccf3a26c496f8d72cb","c2eff5c57d7eb610e023eef3342d410a6b4a15b7","ccfef606b58af279018d5f40bb38f623422c1536"],"id":"e7771dd38f6e6816d17f52cc1aeee83340921cb1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e7771dd38f6e6816d17f52cc1aeee83340921cb1","authors":[{"name":"Guanyao Li","ids":["2279298"]},{"name":"Chun-Jie Chen","ids":["28048219"]},{"name":"Sheng-Yun Huang","ids":["4493923"]},{"name":"Ai-Jou Chou","ids":["28105992"]},{"name":"Xiaochuan Gou","ids":["28110993"]},{"name":"Wen-Chih Peng","ids":["1765218"]},{"name":"Chih-Wei Yi","ids":["1687645"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133173"}

To identify these overlapping communities, a number of overlapping community detection methods have been proposed over the recent years. However, there have been very few studies on the characteristics and the implications of the community overlap. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the nodes and the edges placed within the overlapped regions between the communities using the ground-truth communities as well as algorithmic communities derived from the state-of-the-art overlapping community detection methods. We find that the overlapped nodes and the overlapped edges play different roles from the ones that are not in the overlapped regions. Using real-world data, we empirically show that the highly overlapped nodes are involved in structure holes of a network. Also, we show that the overlapped nodes and edges play an important role in forming new links in evolving networks and diffusing information through a network.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"An Empirical Study of Community Overlap: Ground-truth, Algorithmic Solutions, and Implications","journalPages":"2363-2366","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133133","http://bigdata.cs.skku.edu/slides/CIKM2017_ovlap_poster.pdf","http://bigdata.cs.skku.edu/paper/ovlap_cikm2017.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cluster analysis","Evolving networks","Ground truth","Overlap\u2013add method","Shattered World","Social network","Software propagation","Structural holes"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["319e439675c2d2f56bd2dfbb9836191a57b9ac36","0b19d84d3c44222ab0d3965eedada3a037971bc3","5c6005ea3753b8a5209b402e2ba1e64f466141c5","2b5bc598cd02362874245ccfd932f65f6bc571d9","9df7932c7a69f4f6fad6913cdb76b070a4ddcd80","2d343fd4a6c88503700b24821114c20d62605407","14d23964de88419273079764da61cf541a8298c6","093ecd9bdc133e7c5a13b45dc3d7202fec996206","b787dc1935107552f3e65649243c032074307e0e","1562d6e590aac6e754ce750190ef17060c4a1e93"],"id":"da87a0ed904a1bab9f2ede5fcfd9922226736bbf","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/da87a0ed904a1bab9f2ede5fcfd9922226736bbf","authors":[{"name":"Joyce Jiyoung Whang","ids":["34826931"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133133"}

Predicting the sign of sentiment links is a fundamental task in many areas such as personal advertising and public opinion analysis. Previous works mainly focus on textual sentiment classification, however, text information can only disclose the \"tip of the iceberg»» about users» true opinions, of which the most are unobserved but implied by other sources of information such as social relation and users» profile. To address this problem, in this paper we investigate how to predict possibly existing sentiment links in the presence of heterogeneous information. First, due to the lack of explicit sentiment links in mainstream social networks, we establish a labeled heterogeneous sentiment dataset which consists of users» sentiment relation, social relation and profile knowledge by entity-level sentiment extraction method. Then we propose a novel and flexible end-to-end Signed Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding (SHINE) framework to extract users» latent representations from heterogeneous networks and predict the sign of unobserved sentiment links. SHINE utilizes multiple deep autoencoders to map each user into a low-dimension feature space while preserving the network structure. We demonstrate the superiority of SHINE over state-of-the-art baselines on link prediction and node recommendation in two real-world datasets. The experimental results also prove the efficacy of SHINE in cold start scenario.","inCitations":["2aa4eff3f872784cf1346f6b763afdbc1cd224d2","b0e2ff4fe0dc5c58cd20ba875826e5bcb15d5afb","4e5592a19eab030938b228e934b3dc162f5cc6d9","df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","692d200315b19aa10db37e04ea7894cedc86b711","44dddfec278c782181d6e1bb9ee8f638b37b782d","c8865b6184877fce2873a448d32c1bfd5ba685f2","4b5b91a63bf7cc8f0bb3bfb032e9f539425fcca8"],"pmid":"","title":"SHINE: Signed Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding for Sentiment Link Prediction","journalPages":"592-600","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159666","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00732v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00732","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00732"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["40eab3828f00e1ab4a1458a42686a65f7737b544","033b62167e7358c429738092109311af696e9137","05aba481e8a221df5d8775a3bb749001e7f2525e","563fe87e822a5fffd687caa7ba34849454ee8d8d","439976413a08b3683ac760c64d4670b731c23747","1b1ad82c3e13d09889d391af095e477d7fcb4be9","b0aca3e7877c3c20958b0fae5cbf2dd602104859","3be2609d565f436611090bf5201f73543b3d0610","11bb373a47e7399d4068f0488ecae22a3dd141b8","c34336d3bfb7a3c22caa7958779f40bb2ab70a3d","3201164a38686a73ff8d4bf41a75bc8739b5f210","1cb3c776fcee9f8884e3faa97dda03f8c6f24d95","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","390bc9d41c1169d316accd993fc715b8ed17f269","2cbe0ba73d02aabbeefedf841203219796a551b7","d77c29220d04398427c0a7e17d1deba94faa6e9c","29d0f0556502566f1615ff347b5f568bce46063a","20739c96ed44ccfdc5352ea38e1a2a15137363f4","ebd03c093df7ec30a2a360b377e85b6f00ecb96f","b7b9196227cdf2f55bd5b6fac373c9127ccb7b57","45d84d67870fc5de3b0747d05d9971d750604e7e","1001b274f1d7ab16b26a871745b4918999d6d528","3eaca435527a765572ed04acd06ba512faac89eb","44044556dae0e21cab058c18f704b15d33bd17c5","e50f4d3316d13841c287dcdf5479d7820d593571","323f8bf1473ba139f54a8a1f6441c508aa52624a","feee6ea8961398e599577f9f793230d391985b88","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","d7205a5ecd9a3555a5eee5e31079451d965cc999","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","0710099aee18aabc0605c52628c29ac5ad94ec60","d0b7c8828f0fca4dd901674e8fb5bd464a187664","b6dfa48aa6c8452b1b43ae8afe0d7728314a993e","1e18a71cf45a5b81e64b31a9c330837b0d3c402b"],"id":"3a00965b9fda70d67518450625fca2f69ddd3dca","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3a00965b9fda70d67518450625fca2f69ddd3dca","authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Wang","ids":["49527724"]},{"name":"Fuzheng Zhang","ids":["2642200"]},{"name":"Min Hou","ids":["46921078"]},{"name":"Xing Xie","ids":["40125477"]},{"name":"Minyi Guo","ids":["1697293"]},{"name":"Qi Feng Liu","ids":["39001617"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159666"}

Will the addition of new digital sources such as records repositories, digital libraries, social media, and collections of ephemera change biographical research practices? I use the construction of a subject-driven collection of over 11,750 discrete digital items as a case study to demonstrate how new digital resources can extend the breadth and depth of biographical description, facilitate the rediscovery of a subject's social network, and enable formerly invisible literary influences to be foregrounded. I also explore the implications of the use of ephemera in tandem with other digital resources to ask what we might want to save in the future-including elements of today's social media platforms-and to discuss the trade-offs in making material that was once ephemeral (and difficult to access) so readily available online.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Biography, Ephemera, and the Future of Social Media Archiving","journalPages":"253-262","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3197026.3197051"],"entities":["Archive","Case preservation","Digital library","End-user license agreement","Ephemera","Information sensitivity","Library (computing)","Map","Multimedia framework","One-to-one (data model)","Personally identifiable information","Social media","Social network","Spamming","The New York Times","The Void (virtual reality)","Web feed"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["791e819019b1c0d2f940a8cb9909e17db8416c95","dd276c49c805b2e364b63ab445075a3c29c4f91f","76b0863916477815f06c1234c0b3133406e8e205","890f97fccb57bf839e8ed6e3337d70d5ba8f5808","187baec3ba3e77f96d30635f312759f9061b1eba","1a2dad20dfa229d2d3b3717daf4fda83c0d3e58c","36b09b03a8c13bd9f1f3aa0f582faa52e3d278a4","216466372da1d6cd97224df1a37fd41e7a9247a9","ee2fd1abc28a7490ac923385d82424ef267976ef"],"id":"a50186b84888fb9816c02405f9f9e8772ae56871","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a50186b84888fb9816c02405f9f9e8772ae56871","authors":[{"name":"Catherine C.

Although they are inexpensive and easy-to-use, security concerns of password-based authentication are serious. Phishing and theft of password databases are two critical concerns. The tendency of users to re-use passwords across different services exacerbates the impact of these two concerns. Current solutions addressing these concerns are not fully satisfactory: they typically address only one of the two concerns; they do not protect passwords from rogue servers; they do not provide any verifiable evidence of their (server-side) adoption to users; and they face deployability challenges in terms of the cost for service providers and/or ease-of-use for end users. We present SafeKeeper, a comprehensive approach to protect the confidentiality of passwords in web authentication systems. Unlike previous approaches, SafeKeeper protects user passwords against very strong adversaries, including rogue servers and sophisticated external phishers. It is relatively inexpensive to deploy as it (i) uses widely available hardware securitymechanisms like Intel SGX, (ii) is integrated into popular web platforms like WordPress, and (iii) has small performance overhead. We describe a variety of challenges in designing and implementing such a system, and how we overcome them. Through an 86-participant user study, and systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate the usability, security and deployability of SafeKeeper, which is available as open-source.","inCitations":["ca1f47c97e84b4cc4cf1c96adffe4e9aee9bd90d","9fcc3ccfe739e851afa2ec42a1628b72aeee4808","57a3c4a6f7123db4a491d69cfa8334ef6344b008","8dc29441ba6e6e6fb030a92cdfc1e82508d0dfbc"],"pmid":"","title":"SafeKeeper: Protecting Web Passwords using Trusted Execution Environments","journalPages":"349-358","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01261v2.pdf","http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~mmannan/publications/Safekeeper-poster.pdf","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01261","https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~mmannan/publications/Safekeeper-main.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q52182896","https://ssg.aalto.fi/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Kurnikov-SafeKeeper.pdf"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["00d3125b485217a240682e9e9698ec934274e255","6221f563990f26acd9deb08016c97fd67ee1548c","ebf0acabb4516179810adb46e1b38e78afa70657","955133f76b1fdf5d7d2861df4380afd46b4a5224","513a790b1ee2062f900cea7123ec3c20fc49e41e","0a79c4d70cfede9e7a1af607da355a4082d336b3","2aa0e44b8529de8ee75138eade8aba0bfb9f008f","dcbc0ccc70013ce6411d5a085cb3c95f13debfb1","b963a7055b015555f517b8989bd331cccd755ac7","260bff19562e7b7aaea360c9fd4eacce50b98699","978b079e957c62dcfe3bf3cf2d944ec05b97f8d1","2d7196492af766e6090770a63799f9c1b2d3b915","e9b8381f19c6368dc8b5ef018f888db1a9d11e99","199f3b8eef2bd7df237f3c8516fa01854381992d","00982575a26210dfa845e8387cc9fc796efcf472","708a3c03556b5bc20b5bd8e58ef2f47f6a9fc7d2","595f4c71a2346235bb503f7a4e7500a1b4dd9945","023e5da4662a07b6667c2a71d326e660fcbd4ff7","a7315f8f263567e5234dcde02899a8111876d679","5e5cf29e6268e8c444cb9512cda9b3473426dc3a","19c07d7e5bbcb6a3894ad0f1c775994d1b323f0a","5ac7a4dca5509c9dee49d96b4c3c62cc1d0bb9dd","893f21cab112cc87cd4c2d4cb3227fc5a98857e6","8a698345caad62e3efeee048ea7e6b8f72e0d54d","1d59967ea7b85b6f5f47db5fd59abd61230c5204","1273eaa87c1dd0b279d4ea8a167ef2eda3cb7fd1","3cd386709b9e520d2576e9a2c9643f5e8b3bb100","24dbe1740045da8a1cccefcf6a16363e9d85ee0d","9db1ca86b92cb5e0a21263de77e3e266b71637af"],"id":"20069c2fa1ef4dac1ac2d1f6242acf108a36d794","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/20069c2fa1ef4dac1ac2d1f6242acf108a36d794","authors":[{"name":"Klaudia Krawiecka","ids":["8620204"]},{"name":"Arseny Kurnikov","ids":["2557561"]},{"name":"Andrew Paverd","ids":["1682503"]},{"name":"Mohammad Mannan","ids":["34713547"]},{"name":"N.

Hence profiling graphs becomes of increasing importance to extract order, a posteriori, from the chaotic processes by which such graphs are generated. This talk will motivate the use of graphs as a data model, abstract recent trends in graph data management, and then turn to the issue of profiling and summarising graphs: what are the goals of such profiling, the principles by which graphs can be summarised, the main techniques by which this can/could be achieved?

This has led to expectations in the information retrieval (IR) community that these novel machine learning approaches are likely to demonstrate a similar scale of breakthroughs on IR tasks within the next couple of years. In the Neu-IR (pronounced \"new IR\") 2016 workshop, however, there was a growing concern that the lack of availability of large scale training and evaluation datasets may be hindering the research community from making adequate progress in this area. It was also highlighted that the community would benefit from establishing a shared public repository of neural IR models and shared evaluation resources for better reproducibility and speed of experimentation. After the first successful Neu-IR workshop at SIGIR 2016, our goal this year will be to host a highly interactive full-day workshop to bring the neural IR community together to specifically address these key challenges facing this line of research. The workshop will request the community to submit proposals on generating large scale benchmark collections, building a shared model repository, and standardizing frameworks appropriate for evaluating deep neural network models. In addition, the workshop will provide a forum for the growing community of IR researchers to present their recent (published and unpublished) work involving (shallow or deep) neural network based approaches in an interactive poster session.","inCitations":["e9595c4c99c0aa1fbd092d19813d984f39823494","e301275b5924494b43bff0f931baa324fddc1a0c"],"pmid":"","title":"SIGIR 2017 Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval (Neu-IR'17)","journalPages":"1431-1432","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/craswell-neu-ir-2017.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3084373"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Benchmark (computing)","Computer vision","Deep learning","Information retrieval","Machine learning","Machine translation","Speech recognition"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["686ea4056bd23c2a05baa324722a3194dac8eef8","4aba54ea82bf99ed4690d45051f1b25d8b9554b5","234dc7984668f72ee4917755915040386be4eb1f","c15679f1e190f559cb6123bfa058b5b8adc8c81e","5324ba064dc1656dd51c04122c2c802ef9ec28ce","0aedae19e94d76520cb92932b6506389799051e2","80a974f4797ce9f1d1280630d74eeab6d7475518","02121b35aa2c543e6afbd193afb9c929705b7aee","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","aad41c3828185b8d3e89b73867476b63ad0b9383","2bdffe03bff8373445eda7e1e9439b7300a6f2fd","362d4eec03067fff5a05dd1a450ac7f5d20fbf2f","214adc2dfdc2160cdf5be54001daf2b2304a03b3","3d819ddfd6d4eef1afcc5ef61b58f4eba650dd98","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","42cf161894f4b9ebb86a9109dc2af45d9eee8916","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","543a68fcc4d48726abdef66a2befcd23f154eb3a"],"id":"01d856741137d24743c22d5e54c482325ab8409b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/01d856741137d24743c22d5e54c482325ab8409b","authors":[{"name":"Nick Craswell","ids":["1703980"]},{"name":"W.

How to build interest model for users and understand their real intention brings great challenges. This paper presents an approach which mines the user interest model by multi-source social media (e.g., travelogues and check-in records), and understands the user's real intention by active behavior such as point of interest (POI) inputs. In order to unify heterogeneous data from different sources, a topical package is built as the measurement space. Based on the topical package, user topical package is modeled to find user interest and route topical package is constructed to describe the attributes of each route. User's active behavior can also be considered during route planning, where top ranked routes are finally recommended. The proposed multi-source topical package (MSTP) approach is evaluated on a real dataset and compared with two state-of-the-art methods. The result shows that MSTP performs better for providing personalized travel routes.","inCitations":["317a4572eea4181149501add246dd863eedbf2ae","06cb261c063a45e14d311fb4be1790857ee01db0","ac6efabaa949c6d31c276bdc8028dbd4412b7e28"],"pmid":"","title":"Unifying Multi-Source Social Media Data for Personalized Travel Route Planning","journalPages":"893-896","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080672"],"entities":["Multi-source","Personalization","Point of interest","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["52887969107956d59e1218abb84a1f834a314578","731f7e0558e0d09fe06a12eaa412911929dfd550","aca515a09cefa6b5ff7c136bc0ad18eb335c4590","6008a003a7d4777d213d23d4dc46e3e95ecc1346","a292991f2c383a2d6e2207d0e5b5cd2add3a75c8","c50ebc2f43ff008bc7fc67a44ee40ccf597e9ee5","dc7df8e629fd3774cb94051db99d78e491530ab0"],"id":"690070809677da9fa1efa6725c37655031436c61","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/690070809677da9fa1efa6725c37655031436c61","authors":[{"name":"Gang Hu","ids":["37297409"]},{"name":"Jie Shao","ids":["48384991"]},{"name":"Fumin Shen","ids":["2731972"]},{"name":"Zi Xuan Huang","ids":["2484050"]},{"name":"Heng Tao Shen","ids":["1724393"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080672"}

Traditionally different scoring methods, ranging from simple heuristic models to probabilistic models, have been used for this task. Recently researchers have started to use supervised machine learning techniques for solving this problem which is then called the learning-to-rank (LtR) problem. Many supervised learning methods have been tested so far with empirical success over conventional methods [4]\n The random forest is a relatively simple but effective and efficient learning algorithm which aggregates the predictions of a large number of independent and variant base learners, namely decision trees. Its major benefits over other state-of-the-art methods include inherent parallelizability, ease of tuning and competitive performance. These benefits attract researchers across various disciplines where a random forest is a very popular choice. However, for LtR task, the random forest has not been thoroughly investigated. In this research, we investigate the random forest based LtR algorithms. We aim at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and understanding of these algorithms. With respect to the first goal, we employ undersampling techniques and leverage the inherent structure of a random forest to achieve better scalability, especially for highly imbalanced datasets [2]. We also reduce the correlation among the trees to reduce learning time and to improve performance [3]. With respect to the second goal, we investigate various objective functions ranging from completely randomized splitting criterion to so-called listwise splitting [1]. We also conduct a thorough study on random forest based pointwise algorithms. With respect to the third goal, we develop methods for estimating the bias and variance of rank-learning algorithms, and examine their empirical behavior against parameters of the learning algorithm","inCitations":["ec90406cefe54a6488616ebf5bf0bc7363956497","8549510a69fec4f723250d195f02af66b6b2bccd"],"pmid":"","title":"Scalability and Performance of Random Forest based Learning-to-Rank for Information Retrieval","journalPages":"73-74","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3130332.3130346","http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/p073.pdf"],"entities":["Decision tree","Heuristic","Information retrieval","Learning to rank","Machine learning","Random forest","Randomized algorithm","Scalability","Set splitting problem","Supervised learning","Undersampling"],"journalVolume":"51","outCitations":["58b5474bd16d23717928e57ebdb85bf0f9fd9bf9","f038f83db9fa240729f9805eba23617945b94bb0"],"id":"a1c625b7faa58108ccf7dd08ff14de48ef5eff83","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a1c625b7faa58108ccf7dd08ff14de48ef5eff83","authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ibrahim","ids":["3268578"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3130332.3130346"}

For individual CPs, understanding user behavior, in particular how users migrate among different CPs, is crucial for improving users' on-site experience and the CP's chance of success. In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to analyze and model user migration behavior in video streaming, i.e., users switching content provider during active sessions. Based on a large ISP dataset over two months (6 major content providers, 3.8 million users, and 315 million video requests), we study common migration patterns and reasons of migration. We find that migratory behavior is prevalent: 66% of users switch CPs with an average switching frequency of 13%. In addition, migration behaviors are highly diverse: regardless large or small CPs, they all have dedicated groups of users who like to switch to them for certain types of videos. Regarding reasons of migration, we find CP service quality rarely causes migration, while a few popular videos play a bigger role. Nearly 60% of cross-site migrations are landed to 0.14% top videos. Finally, we validate our findings by building an accurate regression model to predict user migration frequency, and discuss the implications of our results to CPs.","inCitations":["78fec5a93a53063d8c79f919f495a115d3209e57"],"pmid":"","title":"On Migratory Behavior in Video Consumption","journalPages":"1109-1118","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://people.cs.vt.edu/~gangwang/video17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132884"],"entities":["Clock rate","Cross-site cooking","Streaming media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7da24bcadf4df972057c208372293e2da68fd8ac","614acf1813ac4c80aec0452be4c2598cb0945e44","2cda5f949b6e4c5c75fe5a72923e2dfb67f464ec","131d9428e919cd5c5206b8a5dcf3be838f98b26f","4ad9a701f6136751f2841d8e9218d5523a115e01","d76840b8d7e7642336fd7e7ce28321145a0e1d22","5f7e5933e2ce4b846fa4edbb387f613f767f1522","025293699fbf4756796f890cc3359dccedfe18ad","4eb2f2cdb39cd9a8e2450e54f3ad4a91b84a47ee","dba35988c8e82c5ccd724bb2039b6c5175adc839","7ca08d3d65c2bef7d9e1dd683d9679f8f5a65202","bfee37633a52b0cdf6b17f8f6552ebb39545daa6","6a6cfe3209e4dfaa45a5a13a988b47b5dc5425b9","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","14b4f0e8e2a12eb10cfa5e6aed7cff8df8637757","516f842467cc89f0d6551823d6aa0af2c3233c75","d8221bd3916bc6c254ab1cf84f56c2b92ce453d9","13cbb1b747814aa6db01892861a601c6b33dd697","5722a980758e812ef5ed77e582a7a242e138d289","58227bb7c9865b5d89dc26a3a0822e9c7a009ec9","0973a954835aba2b5d7a20ddcca34fcd2d02d1a1","c7ab5c0886f8a9b3570d215ab981c63c77433f1f","43cc2a3c3500ab42a506454b7ab8e9b7839a96ec","6b461615ae3f68458b57a3f28d7e022f68dc5fd9","47f94c0cd9876dea43d76a5be98de7646457c000","615fe45ab84a24d432f023394a8db3d03bb6006a","ee6dd820de431443d68909b1e3e6ed6ec678bd2b","5f60d63d9cd751781f474ef40434edf9e3125d67","28ea425e48eb7e38df55b74d9c2c816ec47bdc18","0a17a81e2e738707836005b62447f12383ddb6ac","1a29dd17b602bbbb487285fc6aa5fa2bb9bf8649","04f96789fdee1df571a4bd2dca1e46f0522f1746","1af88a8430fedde965b4cf15488b5a397b9b09f3","24f95cc73758d870706fe8ab590d477b9dd2b791"],"id":"14ff3b41678dce46a2f490b239be769779a9d1e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/14ff3b41678dce46a2f490b239be769779a9d1e1","authors":[{"name":"Huan Yan","ids":["2060052"]},{"name":"Tzu-Heng Lin","ids":["6972563"]},{"name":"Gang Wang","ids":["50248340"]},{"name":"Yong Li","ids":["39948674"]},{"name":"Haitao Zheng","ids":["2704852"]},{"name":"Depeng Jin","ids":["1717719"]},{"name":"Ben Y.

Using various experiments on the gold standard data prepared in the FIRE 2016 Microblog Track [3], we show that the gold standard data prepared in [3] missed many relevant tweets. We also demonstrate that using a machine learning model can help in retrieving the remaining relevant tweets by training an SVM model on a subset of the data and using it to get the most useful tweets in the entire dataset. We obtain high precision and recall even with very little training data, which makes such a model suitable for use in a real-time disaster situation.","inCitations":["a7f46cb92f4cac943592b04134cc7fcbad3efd9f","fd20e8ea38f51173d8f8aefe29f15f79485b965c"],"pmid":"","title":"Microblog Retrieval for Disaster Relief: How To Create Ground Truths?","journalPages":"42-51","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed0f/3831b03062568a5b8ea3b74f4159e72f3bd9.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1832/SMERP_2017_peer_review_paper_6.pdf"],"entities":["Experiment","Machine learning","Precision and recall","Real-time data","Real-time transcription"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0d76e84d1cc645857a0e6092fa73e0f1b0e7299a","e3efbbfca015f1b6d1a45612a42735d352bd3b79","150a31a1d38d90acefb560c2a42efed1ae67f7f7","1be16d8c557b15cdf2db9e7eb4453f2274fd60af","5a9e85af0bc45472e9c14e956819f1324085aaa1","47dd6b9d9cedbe2526ad22a01ca4fea1025e07d1"],"id":"ed0f3831b03062568a5b8ea3b74f4159e72f3bd9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ed0f3831b03062568a5b8ea3b74f4159e72f3bd9","authors":[{"name":"Ribhav Soni","ids":["7283204"]},{"name":"Sukomal Pal","ids":["39592413"]}],"doi":""}

Systematic reviews appraise and synthesise studies that meet specific inclusion criteria. Systematic reviews intended for a biomedical science audience use boolean queries with many, often complex, search clauses to retrieve studies; these are then manually screened to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. This process is expensive and time consuming. The development of systems that improve retrieval effectiveness will have an immediate impact by reducing the complexity and resources required for this process. Our test collection consists of approximately 26 million research studies extracted from the freely available MEDLINE database, 94 review (query) topics extracted from Cochrane systematic reviews, and corresponding relevance assessments.

{"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052682","venue":"WWW","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2017,"paperAbstract":"In online advertising, advertisers purchase ad placements by participating in a long sequence of repeated auctions. One of the most important features advertising platforms often provide, and advertisers often use, is budget management, which allows advertisers to control their cumulative expenditures. Advertisers typically declare the maximum daily amount they are willing to pay, and the platform adjusts allocations and payments to guarantee that cumulative expenditures do not exceed budgets. There are multiple ways to achieve this goal, and each one, when applied to all budget-constrained advertisers simultaneously, steers the system toward a different equilibrium. While previous research focused on online stochastic optimization techniques or game-theoretic equilibria of such settings, our goal in this paper is to compare the \u201csystem equilibria\u201d of a range of budget management strategies in terms of the seller\u2019s profit and buyers\u2019 utility. In particular, we consider six different budget management strategies including probabilistic throttling, thresholding, bid shading, reserve pricing, and multiplicative boosting. We show these methods admit a system equilibrium in a rather general setting, and prove dominance relations between them in a simplified setting. Our study sheds light on the impact of budget management strategies on the tradeoff between the seller\u2019s profit and buyers\u2019 utility. Finally, we also empirically compare the system equilibria of these strategies using real ad auction data in sponsored search and randomly generated bids. The empirical study confirms our theoretical findings about the relative performances of budget management strategies. ∗We thank Omar Besbes and Gabriel Weintraub for helpful discussions that motivated this research.

{"doiUrl":"","venue":"International Semantic Web Conference","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2018,"paperAbstract":"The wide adoption of the RDF data model demands efficient and scalable query processing strategies. For this purpose distributed programming paradigms such as Apache Spark on top of Hadoop are increasingly being used. Unfortunately, the Hadoop ecosystem lacks support for Semantic Web standards, e.g. reading an RDF serialization format, and thus, bringing in RDF data still requires a large amount of effort. We therefore present PRoST-loader, an application which, given a set of N-Triples documents, creates logical partitions according to three widely adopted strategies: Triple Table (TT), Wide Property Table (WPT) with a single row for each subject, and Vertical Partitioning (VP). Each strategy has its own advantages and limitations depending on the data characteristics and the task to be carried out. The loader thus leaves the strategy choice to the data engineer. The tool combines the flexibility of Spark, the deserialization capabilities of Hive, as well as the compression power of Apache Parquet at the storage layer. We managed to process Dbpedia (approx. 257M triples) in 3.5 min for TT, in approx 3.1 days for VP, and in 16.8 min for WPT with up to 1,114 columns in a cluster with moderate resources. In this paper we aim to present the strategies followed, but also to expose the community to this open-source tool, which facilitates the usage of Semantic Web data within the Hadoop ecosystem and which makes it possible to carry out tasks such as the evaluation of SPARQL queries in a scalable manner.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Flexible N-Triples Loader for Hadoop","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/556a/29cacdccb7d0a9e70aa8bdd06956639b8833.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-04.pdf"],"entities":["Apache Hadoop","Apache Hive","Apache Parquet","Apache Spark","Approximation","Binary space partitioning","Column (database)","DBpedia","Data model","Database","Distributed computing","Ecosystem","Maxima and minima","Multistage interconnection networks","Open-source software","Programming paradigm","Resource Description Framework","SPARQL","Scalability","Semantic Web","Serialization","Web standards"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c3b028e65ccfbd80d8d3c3f0cedb6b0c2edd06c8","3ab9bd75bd968186259ce8aa6f19824faf5718f7","16bae0f9f6a2823b2a65f6296494eea41f5c9859","a531fb4d4e91c79adf6d81928e1ca5e64dcab3e8","5d3158674e1a0fedf69299a905151949fb8b01a5","019c886c2326f826298c8f48fe82dbae85ca5f2d"],"id":"556a29cacdccb7d0a9e70aa8bdd06956639b8833","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/556a29cacdccb7d0a9e70aa8bdd06956639b8833","authors":[{"name":"Victor Anthony Arrascue Ayala","ids":["3108054"]},{"name":"Georg Lausen","ids":["1809410"]}],"doi":""}

Given a property graph, simulating another graph with same or greater size with the same statistical properties with respect to the labels and connectivity is critical for privacy preservation and benchmarking purposes. In this work we tackle the problem of capturing the statistical dependence of the edge connectivity on the vertex labels and using the same distribution to regenerate property graphs of the same or expanded size in a scalable manner. However, accurate simulation becomes a challenge when the attributes do not completely explain the network structure. We propose the Property Graph Model (PGM) approach that uses a label augmentation strategy to mitigate the problem and preserve the vertex label and the edge connectivity distributions as well as their correlation, while also replicating the degree distribution. Our proposed algorithm is scalable with a linear complexity in the number of edges in the target graph. We illustrate the efficacy of the PGM approach in regenerating and expanding the datasets by leveraging two distinct illustrations. Our open-source implementation is available on GitHub.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"When Labels Fall Short: Property Graph Simulation via Blending of Network Structure and Vertex Attributes","journalPages":"2287-2290","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133065","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02339v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02339"],"entities":["Algorithm","Alpha compositing","Degree distribution","K-edge-connected graph","Open-source software","Scalability","Semantic network","Simulation","Vertex (geometry)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a8370aaa0ba9d69b7e83d5785c27b11be973cd84","3117b0ab952f5ce0e10c73b155557c22c169c644","c5ff87df2b55393887512bb52b1740b5c981ba97","3221ccaf4495320b6c46ce00a5a9328cbef39839","199369d8eaff23e00c106ef2ddc4181696600c1f","8b586837ac372141eedafd124c57335cbc893bed","3607fdeb8cdf3ab4be72b682b235330cf2d4199b","4ce777b863f7656a928d2d7831247a699213f264","ca70aca47d8fe8a604e1a9af0eae22c6604f8407"],"id":"0e55344bf0338bfed6264499f18b4bd38cff728b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0e55344bf0338bfed6264499f18b4bd38cff728b","authors":[{"name":"Arun V.

Previous methods for this task require manual feature engineering, huge memory requirements and large execution times. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to present a novel supervised neural approach for text segmentation. Specifically, we propose an attention-based bidirectional LSTM model where sentence embeddings are learned using CNNs and the segments are predicted based on contextual information. This model can automatically handle variable sized context information. Compared to the existing competitive baselines, the proposed model shows a performance improvement of ∼7% in WinDiff score on three benchmark datasets.","inCitations":["e9f7ca5d4cf9b9aca2706ae67dc3de58d7ebf498"],"pmid":"","title":"Attention-Based Neural Text Segmentation","journalPages":"180-193","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09935","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09935v1.pdf","http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/download/inproceedings.pdf.9272879615b02f00.417474656e74696f6e2d6261736564204e657572616c2054657874205365676d656e746174696f6e2028454349522d32303138292e706466.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_14"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Benchmark (computing)","Convolutional neural network","Experiment","Feature engineering","Long short-term memory","Natural language processing","Neural network software","Requirement","Text segmentation","WinDiff"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7b0a66c2bde7b26372b1aed8d2a3774d74c5f591","61e31ce474ba70f27dfc39b6d052090c8f62e951","2c61760048d9bdae7888747eaf288d8745b3630c","410bc41c4372fd78a68cd08ad39f2a2c5156fc52","118a331364f30592d12eafe9af8a8c84b59b961c","8ab0c46b9b6cab8754ac7a130b822bad8e961b6f","4eefa16119a05330478054283dc5f16227afdae7","2b0299de457c18ff9f181afcef116181445a1cc7","d6e880a66432444aafd5330e336e589dc8ac25ac","bda9b5811efab5ba8887fdaba640196b40966e3f","4b5a3e77fa3ca6b2cf91cda4e602bdf2ad3e9969","c0a6e375817e3eab2165bde1d47c9745e25d3bbd","cb91a9ef1723440bd35a3e5965a2e180ad1ab36f","c388ac1a104f92f1c48fe934930c4ac0844acdad","367815fecdd155bfa659ac278ca95cb95b63d7a3","3b732cb4305072ee518d7214b83b43b129ec2ba6","35fc0833a4166a04d4b911b2f4a14ad82a2fc8e0","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","5bd2a83c1eb085e853dc21520ab27568cc0ab366","68291fe526f62721a848603b3e9830920bdc0f20","0e061c114a616fc810ad60a961a388477eb07214","1f05380f9d149a5a50eb71076f4f01629d548a10","468b9055950c428b17f0bf2ff63fe48a6cb6c998","269549b3b0c9460a08f3d74d70ffb2356dca0a75","43c4b766f7fdae2ae867651d40716387d34168e5","1967ad3ac8a598adc6929e9e6b9682734f789427","8729441d734782c3ed532a7d2d9611b438c0a09a","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","0af737eae02032e66e035dfed7f853ccb095d6f5","04e598db94d15bd5e61e63cf387637e87a5115d6","31aba40986ce494acb1a9529ff42d10b3f3127d8","586f3b6f301ff37bcf13ed070613a6e5c6f47e0e","aba9739c6e49f01048134557e5bc0340fd11e42e"],"id":"a13c8fcac9b7097e622449b90e191e6f68a5c092","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a13c8fcac9b7097e622449b90e191e6f68a5c092","authors":[{"name":"Pinkesh Badjatiya","ids":["10357841"]},{"name":"Litton J.

However, this kind of matrix approximation method still leaves some important issues unsolved, for example, the randomly selecting anchor nodes. In this paper, we study the problem of the selection of anchor nodes to enhance locally low-rank matrix approximation. We propose a new model for local low-rank matrix approximation which selects anchor-points using a heuristic method. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Moreover, the proposed method can significantly improve algorithm efficiency, and it is easy to parallelize. These traits make it potential for large scale real-world recommender systems.","inCitations":["6bfce0993936c9c9cd2d3c112c087c4d62690cfe","9a6189d658a6afc3827379db8ea0c895c399cc58"],"pmid":"","title":"Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation with Preference Selection of Anchor Points","journalPages":"1395-1403","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1395.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3051148"],"entities":["Algorithm","Algorithmic efficiency","Approximation","Computer vision","Experiment","Heuristic","Personalization","Randomness","Recommender system","Singular value decomposition","Text mining"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e3e6fadf6be1471eac47079d5a8596fa39ba5516","1c7ecb026eeba7b0b6e933f62be1ecde40af0f3f","ae3a1ee30cd563efe8ae2744dee9bd1a41bcc354","641c06b56c9676950b86bb74a658c6a8a198722b","c864175780adde19099108de66b4636f4c87d44c","2ac0e0d78aefeb412243bcbadb3d5faa3c5a3ead","3e10498198c9f5d4ca0abebe04a5847874c9be24","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","300e7e6d1d3a59eefd7ce8b17e4b2efd102593ba","308e6dbbc4436e96453110897b97a9ae79b413a6","7536e758f07d3dda1f381b70556828c5f15889a5","24463c0340965b518c90b579ccd52d3213bfa1b3","328af02c4db60dba12b93c2cbcc7592eb45a96c7","31af4b8793e93fd35e89569ccd663ae8777f0072","2cbe0ba73d02aabbeefedf841203219796a551b7","a3d86c97ffc750dc98ad6717cbc63979926e97a2","cd7eab222292b387c35926518cc3b4be087aa47d","160526781a6ece92e424470e79cac5dfde83c0f6","64c871cd7e0af7e1aeb94d98c6214eb8d8e8b989","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20","17f47b017b28d16124bbfa4a87b06c714f0b34e1","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8"],"id":"9644411e41ed9f36de06f226d3dbf6220b89e4cb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9644411e41ed9f36de06f226d3dbf6220b89e4cb","authors":[{"name":"Menghao Zhang","ids":["7979474"]},{"name":"Binbin Hu","ids":["48187964"]},{"name":"Chuan Shi","ids":["39461639"]},{"name":"Bai Wang","ids":["40004402"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3051148"}

Most existing approaches learn node embeddings by exploring the structure of networks and are mainly focused on static non-attributed graphs. However, many real-world applications, such as stock markets and public review websites, involve bipartite graphs with dynamic and attributed edges, called attributed interaction graphs. Different from conventional graph data, attributed interaction graphs involve two kinds of entities (e.g. investors/stocks and users/businesses) and edges of temporal interactions with attributes (e.g. transactions and reviews). In this paper, we study the problem of node embedding in attributed interaction graphs. Learning embeddings in interaction graphs is highly challenging due to the dynamics and heterogeneous attributes of edges. Different from conventional static graphs, in attributed interaction graphs, each edge can have totally different meanings when the interaction is at different times or associated with different attributes. We propose a deep node embedding method called IGE (Interaction Graph Embedding). IGE is composed of three neural networks: an encoding network is proposed to transform attributes into a fixed-length vector to deal with the heterogeneity of attributes; then encoded attribute vectors interact with nodes multiplicatively in two coupled prediction networks that investigate the temporal dependency by treating incident edges of a node as the analogy of a sentence in word embedding methods. The encoding network can be specifically designed for different datasets as long as it is differentiable, in which case it can be trained together with prediction networks by back-propagation. We evaluate our proposed method and various comparing methods on four real-world datasets. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the learned embeddings by IGE on both node clustering and classification tasks.","inCitations":["75d772f93fb0a75b88cd776bd2c8682dbea7d6fe","df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","44dddfec278c782181d6e1bb9ee8f638b37b782d","9238b2256e895f254e9ac64398ede941a050196b","b0e2ff4fe0dc5c58cd20ba875826e5bcb15d5afb","b6f28bdd6466de76a575a1a44932732ad92bd61b","07577af75ca95e7666888d19969a53ef4dd905a5","2f92a268e176cda6dd98ef74f351fca2735e3462"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning Node Embeddings in Interaction Graphs","journalPages":"397-406","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132918","http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~xkong/publications/papers/cikm17.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Backpropagation","Cluster analysis","Entity","Graph embedding","IGE","Interaction","Map","Review site","Software propagation","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","6b40f545d3d3f18b62112ba8d0e51feaad12d16a","03b18dcde7ba5bb0e87b2bdb68ab7af951daf162","83174a52f38c80427e237446ccda79e2a9170742","41285e207f2bfb861d3aee7c1557a9b8525745af","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","8dfddcfd67a586f6ed8957174adf1d35c4bd4584","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05","20739c96ed44ccfdc5352ea38e1a2a15137363f4","195155a3b4affc58ec1246d5267632408d37c233","50072882718b67aa49595570f8e1eeef5987dec2","4f90acbfe479bad10b1c733dc7e6a174fd4b2870","5323ce15f47e06e63c1ee630ecdc2dfbd563d006","3eaca435527a765572ed04acd06ba512faac89eb","1ff2f56ea61919f4782694f1589f64282dfa85d7","1ccf5670461638542b32fc7bd86cd47bf2f9d050","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","09ef6b06bf395b86d54e490ad61bf8a808f5a262","8bd682e46026b5fedae5727979fc76842072ac96","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8"],"id":"b1cc014a55015c0ec13e340c96d58a2bcca72f65","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b1cc014a55015c0ec13e340c96d58a2bcca72f65","authors":[{"name":"Yao Zhang","ids":["3631757"]},{"name":"Yun Xiong","ids":["33629364"]},{"name":"Xiangnan Kong","ids":["1833914"]},{"name":"Yangyong Zhu","ids":["8247706"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132918"}

Some examples of sparse data include short text snippets (such as tweets in Twitter) or some feature representations of categorical data sets with a large number of values, in which traditional methods for outlier detection typically fail because of the difficulty of computing distances. To address this, it is important to use the latent relations between such values. Factorization machines represent a natural methodology for this, and are naturally designed for the massive-domain setting because of their emphasis on sparse data sets. In this study, we propose an outlier detection approach for sparse data with factorization machines. Factorization machines are also efficient due to their linear complexity in the number of non-zero values. In fact, because of their efficiency, they can even be extended to traditional settings for numerical data by an appropriate feature engineering effort. We show that our approach is both effective and efficient for sparse categorical, short text and numerical data by an extensive experimental study.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Outlier Detection in Sparse Data with Factorization Machines","journalPages":"817-826","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132987"],"entities":["Anomaly detection","Categorical variable","Discretization","Experiment","Feature engineering","Level of measurement","Neural coding","Numerical analysis","Sparse matrix","Text corpus","Unsupervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["741abfcb621d9aa19aa79e4aa5c5cddb1473b3da","0372728b9a2def008ef3240a62362f0afbfb5d43","a8db789522b9375396bd91de631342740ba19a12","3271f19f689f6e4c26bed8bf3d3c8e2629bad79a","c1bea7d028c68212554b163f90d5d78065b2e6f1","77786bb6de48bcf0ffa7ebe4827f3b11b72f8546","b6b6d2504fd57d27a0467654fa62169cc7dedbdd","0e7c75fc648ab84a15698921c241795d9ab55f1f","811ef989344c39d8695a1cd426ad74d64ab337d0","3d890a2ec766f9ec146285ababde8d92ee6a099f","0ef1a457e368317f1dff41d944b620515cf54e17","2346428466065d06e8f3e5b6405293e639defd3e","10fb435a8bf441411264026729ed5ac7fc6f3806","1683ffc189d16b616131c300f45af87602d211f7","1e63600b5906a6e18c2b9540155b9adb85c4d437","b1f06867f0aa6a637e8b21283b71cf3e73d580ae","efcb38b3a164df55920bc05dc87069cd79a14df7","01af5c246af8e1e70f5a0882bc1ad867b15b01dc","4cdad9b059b5077fcce00fb8bcb4e381edd353bd","2bab6704680e0adf0cd847ad40c08b308dcd0a2b","f56f9d83766c6b53d437497a722de73d71f2f82b","05aba481e8a221df5d8775a3bb749001e7f2525e","b9e94fabb8f9b7ea9b20b092721cac1af1258c38","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","8c84e79451d4b006f64265270f96773e468343f6","0bad381b84f48b28abc1a98f05993c8eb5be747d","766224c9272e2e7f04bff32a64457f0b4c3472aa","3df2dabde0b136a35965eafeb97e66758ab085f4","0e93d05017b495f205fbf5d27188bba7be9be5e4","e50f4d3316d13841c287dcdf5479d7820d593571","8720c61671436d7c558322af6345ba1415bc96c8","6d76a9bea083e173fc1a1dd9732a2036fa31f292","9d4694f2a08da8f34133add0c725269084f898ac","51ceee6f58202f2082c6c322f5a656434f39e6cb","15fa306f4506296568564b752b1fed8b0cd53319","28b746a538ee25055bf79df7ba70cdfc37c8e308","ecc7f40cab6dc79d888275717068752d98de9ea5","aecd8a5952ff7c7c91c7e7a4e9363cc69e4b010a","7f6e891521f1c45027861be047c7ab1d07a2be0a","e5208097b88a4f0d73c28c3c669b17ed8f369c22","3b5bcfa086ae48a15b5ea5e7f13d998a4fe315ab"],"id":"f33abdf6947fa9b186baae8f625f5d384b2594ce","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f33abdf6947fa9b186baae8f625f5d384b2594ce","authors":[{"name":"Mengxiao Zhu","ids":["1856835"]},{"name":"Charu C.

To this end, many recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). Using matrix Factorization (MF) - the most widely used model in recommendation - as a demonstration, we show that optimizing it with BPR leads to a recommender model that is not robust. In particular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly large error in generalization. To enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its generalization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR). In short, our APR enhances the pairwise ranking method BPR by performing adversarial training. It can be interpreted as playing a minimax game, where the minimization of the BPR objective function meanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model parameters to maximize the BPR objective function. To illustrate how it works, we implement APR on MF by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding vectors of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of APR - by optimizing MF with APR, it outperforms BPR with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves state-of-the-art performance for item recommendation.

However, the embedding models themselves are often not used directly alongside structured data: they merely serve as additional evidence for structured knowledge extraction. In the metaphactory knowledge graph management platform, we use federated hybrid SPARQL queries for combining explicit information stated in the graph, implicit information from the associated embedding models, and information extracted using vector embeddings in a transparent way for the end user.

These methods are often used in hopes of drawing in a wider group of participants, but existing literature on digital inequality suggests that this is unlikely to happen. Applying a mixed methods approach, we investigate how likely the expectations related to these new opportunities are to be met. We used semi-structure interviews to draw out what effects party members think online participation will have. We then conducted a survey asking members about their plans to change their behaviour. Comparing expectations to prospective behavioural changes, we find that the high hopes of both party members and leaders - to draw in those members who currently do not engage - are likely to be disappointed. Members who are better off, better educated, and already more active, will likely benefit more than those the party hopes to engage. We argue that this is linked to the prevailing digital divide, and that those who are targeted for more participation need to be more actively addressed to achieve broader participation.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Everybody Thinks Online Participation is Great - for Somebody Else: A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Perceptions and Expectations of Online Participation in the Green Party Germany","journalPages":"287-296","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/419199/1/Everybody_thinks_online_participation_is_great_final_.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3201064.3201069"],"entities":["Online and offline","Prospective search","Seamless3d","Semiconductor industry","Social inequality"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b815458ce1d79c7bcc383b5db508a8a059e9716b","d8fa8781a83a6fc678abc514c4775f368dcac11d","d85cb284822ebcfea711c9e340c61c8df033cd1c","81d18509eec39b5ec7e8fcb8c1f32fda65f79d18","d6a7a779d1c53e671fc9270fb8d5dcbf3753b356","0d4acce96ce85423130b989bfb1d2d644cbb2e2d","d70cc6d522eab048b818c83109b8e8eaa98b7980","b7fce5eb9abec6f32dff3146ce7cd18edc333c2b","82ec25dc56f95f8bc63cc4cb4d7f1b1f4f9719d8","d209f6681f96658f9704321c3fffd14db4554821"],"id":"4b787dfbac35de1515a0cabade365d5e7345dd06","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4b787dfbac35de1515a0cabade365d5e7345dd06","authors":[{"name":"Gefion Thuermer","ids":["40306551"]},{"name":"Silke Roth","ids":["38089639"]},{"name":"Kieron O'Hara","ids":["40148705"]},{"name":"Steffen Staab","ids":["1752093"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201069"}

This paper is concerned with the specific problem of finding and ranking relations from a given Knowledge Graph (KG) that hold over pairs of entities juxtaposed in a table or structured list. The state-of-the-art for this task is to attempt to link the entities mentioned in the table cells to objects in the KG and rank the relations that hold for those linked objects. As a result, these methods are hampered by the incompleteness and uneven coverage in even the best knowledge graphs available today. The alternative described here does not require entity linking, relying instead on ranking relations using generative language models derived from Web-scale corpora. As such, it can produce quality results even when the entities in the table are missing in the KG. The experimental validation, designed to expose the challenges posed by KG incompleteness, shows that our approach is robust and effective in practice.

Most DIYers use online search to find information but it is usually time-consuming and challenging for novice DIYers to understand the retrieved results and later apply them to their individual DIY tasks. In the work, we present a Question Answering (QA) system which can address the DIYers\u2019 specific needs. The core component is a knowledge base (KB) which contains a vast amount of domain knowledge encoded in a knowledge graph.

Examples of such local events include small venue concerts, farmers markets, sports activities, etc. Given an event entity, we propose a graph-based framework for retrieving a ranked list of related events that a user is likely to be interested in attending. Due to the difficulty of obtaining ground-truth labels for event entities, which are temporal and are constrained by location, our retrieval framework is unsupervised, and its graph-based formulation addresses (a) the challenge of feature sparseness and noisiness, and (b) the semantic mismatch problem in a self-contained and principled manner.\n To validate our methods, we collect human annotations and conduct a comprehensive empirical study, analyzing the performance of our methods with regard to relevance, recall, and diversity. This study shows that our graph-based framework is significantly better than any individual feature source, and can be further improved with minimal supervision.","inCitations":["ec6cdaa7d83b362695c1babfa91dfaa303ca675b","fb4349ef4f5eb16b0b25ed050f7b9a5101b44730","df093ac2bb82c3a8812ebe76792008315d09c6f0"],"pmid":"","title":"Related Event Discovery","journalPages":"355-364","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018713","https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45659.pdf"],"entities":["Emoticon","Entity","Graph (discrete mathematics)","Ground truth","Neural coding","Relevance","Unsupervised learning","Venue (sound system)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3d1d94a075498f86f4b6bcad7cb4037e82ab50d3","1d60ae6720118273b02fd60b54c27441e17e719a","016ba7df01c93739e9004454dc00976609f442b1","1081a81d93c74d83c3fa0f7a78d3f987c117739f","003b9a722913d79e045bf00ace0129dd6e1bcaaa","5199dab867277dc1b63193f7f8a3086c8c31c412","ef9d07357f7147fa6fbc64fbea605c7d3c552f03","2a11500adf038e8945b68149f60e90ff6499bf62","c35bf791e891adefac6ffb85cf16baa7e53fbe7f","7f71c1f81f65144761f71455724723369108675d","42043ccc989019c1d4a6d6425c593170586a4dd1","5eb70ff218448dc6023ea024ee0de9c6b9820623","2776d11afa421ec7403606f902dc757de95583b2","158f9e4e385645d2db3949483789cc84ceb41c3c","9e698010f9d8fa374e7f49f776af301dd200c548","252c5715c84224a90d7ffcc1823a3f063072b3f0","541e99f3486352a92263a683da8b706169f40ed0","1379cc1e4a0fab44ff4ead7a0b065eae78d5f4e3","453afc6e82b08d15aaa2f2208d0c41eb03940800","33c9e54e2986563d2bd15bc577494bbf626b09de","d0bdc8254d01144a2f057d4ec3c8027760d9748e","d18808d5464d82a1f0af6af14819e1b19ee36729","1ff66164070777efe9faa5d73aaa3c4386d6cab2","a7f6cdc19cf738769a6aea957dd1ead8875bad64","c1472eb7f33411dc3817cde0ab35f0c25a1add11","0c5405c4d603e1126a0f8abe339c27dbbe407700","8b439d2ee0b80364c4254916800657c4111c2e43","46e1e1f4b106f570292b359e456fe998217ae489","0baa5f1c27e4e6a13a0d67cb089ff18e9ab6df1d","02485a373142312c354b79552b3d326913eaf86d","3e3c636d77ff7fb85c0fc0c1026900576f40d6ce","2b9d3dac1a35ef9c9da51d87b7ceb0298212a10e","0a3d8e17f64461af61b4cb41b93422af111e859f","0192e8db68b74f8381e73cb7fc2969754f9e53de","94405297ffa73af6d1d5d61da40314fb5da48629","95cb5312b3dbbb5065636f0f379d456be7986a4c","02243d07697a5c82360dbecae05709a575a756c2"],"id":"fbae2e29511da2ae325750890c800996709b0cf9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fbae2e29511da2ae325750890c800996709b0cf9","authors":[{"name":"Cheng Li","ids":["46651787"]},{"name":"Michael Bendersky","ids":["1815447"]},{"name":"Vijay Garg","ids":["21041577"]},{"name":"Sujith Ravi","ids":["35014893"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018713"}

Undeniably, shopping is one of the most essential activities in our society and studying consumer\u2019s shopping behavior is important for the industry as well as sociology and psychology. Not surprisingly, one of the most popular e-commerce categories is clothing business. There arises the needs for analysis of popular and attractive clothing features which could further boost many emerging applications, such as clothing recommendation and advertising. In this work, we design a novel system that consists of three major components: 1) exploring and organizing a large-scale clothing dataset from a online shopping website, 2) pruning and extracting images of best-selling products in clothing item data and user transaction history, and 3) utilizing a machine learning based approach to discovering clothing attributes as the representative and discriminative characteristics of popular clothing style elements. Through the experiments over a large-scale online clothing dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system, and obtain useful insights on clothing consumption trends and profitable clothing features.","inCitations":["f499e84b489b0b4afe86e303803871700e561063","3a71881855d75cb68d0f0cb17be234ef1864011e","dc77287bb1fcf64358767dc5b5a8a79ed9abaa53"],"pmid":"","title":"When Fashion Meets Big Data: Discriminative Mining of Best Selling Clothing Features","journalPages":"15-22","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55af/4918d6b20d13c58c482d7e31e17db53c6ab5.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03915v2.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054141","http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03915","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03915v1.pdf"],"entities":["Big data","E-commerce","Experiment","Machine learning","Online shopping","Organizing (structure)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2c97d74befefad85ccaaa30bc0e7ce9a768deb94","a76aee280abaff82a9e576c27eb65e1b1bbbf2eb","5c3785bc4dc07d7e77deef7e90973bdeeea760a5","162d958ff885f1462aeda91cd72582323fd6a1f4","7808937b46acad36e43c30ae4e9f3fd57462853d","66986f4359c3507d671bad021d6fb2d6fa6aa2c0","37866fea39deeff453802cde529dd9d32e0205a5","7af3084aa104760d16bb380d4d37ddac0442b850","13e5f0c40c85ca8e01b3756963d5352358de7c29","a0dc8911c47c3d0e1643ecfaa7032cee6fb5eb64","64b8553bd62997d332910078bcd5ee74a43f9350","a538b05ebb01a40323997629e171c91aa28b8e2f","3b2697d76f035304bfeb57f6a682224c87645065","0f16f6f478b5c788dce466eb50e36c612273c36e","7a953aaf29ef67ee094943d4be50d753b3744573","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","3096595380cfc118bb163b74897e13a84d094432","1a07186bc10592f0330655519ad91652125cd907","71969ee27916d545c63fe852946dd6dcc015d1a8","09fa54f1ab7aaa83124d2415bfc6eb51e4b1f081","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","064fb3a6f2666e17f6d411c0a731d56aae0a785e","ae753fd46a744725424690d22d0d00fb05e53350","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","2b067bec1f6c4f45288cd1ef349f21586a5f87b3"],"id":"55af4918d6b20d13c58c482d7e31e17db53c6ab5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/55af4918d6b20d13c58c482d7e31e17db53c6ab5","authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Ting Chen","ids":["1751689"]},{"name":"Jiebo Luo","ids":["33642939"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054141"}

In this work we present an approach to consume and process schema.org annotated data on the web and give an idea how a best practice can look like.","inCitations":["6661e65676d986aca487dd6d2ed72eb5369c291b","c539160926135d68ea479c6b5cc4db690ca0575c"],"pmid":"","title":"Annotation-Based Automatic Action Processing","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5f27/f164c692a2cb08a8b1794d82312e0300f8f9.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1963/paper564.pdf","https://iswc2017.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/PostersDemos/paper564.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07654","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07654v2.pdf"],"entities":["Best practice","Mathematical optimization","Schema.org","Search engine optimization","Vocabulary","Web page","Web search engine","Web service"],"journalVolume":"abs/1709.07654","outCitations":["fc00f6c821b0bfcfb9842d67201abdaeadf4084a","a6d3ceea74deba7ba762ec051492d79794933e98","71e9a23138a5d7c35b28bd98fd616c81719b1b7a","ff5c0aefe469545adff37b34c505c3987e8bd1d1","9cec71603f6b6e123e2d1c787ec8b816e5d81140","6f9e9a372f873d7714d3cf12a523f7bdb9e7f4b4","08bae32492f4f8a262ec990853613151cc484dc5","87406a1a07b19da5eb93f3b20abcdddc975e7219","c7ed65e4e5cbaffe47c30ab63718389cc47b1eb6","b176f71b2bb9e54d2fc0ab08ecde3d9a98a0bb19","c1171a29489a3e47cc70f8cccf09b9b32eda54b6","20ac96a416695b074da37550c6370d6a14dd2084","2aa600bcc21b03f1ff23d6b2418a07abc3494ba0"],"id":"8bf440c033d86c44a867673d343f2ec9b854387d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8bf440c033d86c44a867673d343f2ec9b854387d","authors":[{"name":"Elias Kärle","ids":["2939293"]},{"name":"Dieter Fensel","ids":["1766239"]}],"doi":""}

Users expect these systems to be fast and provide relevant results to their query and context. With millions of documents to choose from, these systems utilize a multi-pass scoring function to narrow the results and provide the most relevant ones to users. Candidate selection is required to sift through all the documents in the index and select a relevant few to be ranked by subsequent scoring functions. It becomes crucial to narrow down the document set while maintaining relevant ones in resulting set. In this tutorial we survey various candidate selection techniques and deep dive into case studies on a large scale social media platform.

This paper mainly aims to make the Euclidean distance measure appropriate to nominal data clustering, and the core idea is to transform each nominal attribute value into numerical. This transformation method consists of three steps. In the first step, the weighted self-information, which can quantify the amount of information in attribute values, is calculated for each value in each nominal attribute. In the second step, we find k nearest neighbors for each object because k nearest neighbors of one object have close similarities with it. In the last step, the weighted self-information of each attribute value in each nominal object is modified according to the object's k nearest neighbors. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments are done on 10 data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only enables the Euclidean distance to be used for nominal data clustering, but also can acquire the better clustering performance than several existing state-of-the-art approaches.","inCitations":["e0fedbd99ee21dd10e2becb54b4a74509588d4a2"],"pmid":"","title":"An Euclidean Distance based on the Weighted Self-information Related Data Transformation for Nominal Data Clustering","journalPages":"2083-2086","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133062"],"entities":["Cluster analysis","Cobham's thesis","Euclidean distance","Experiment","Householder transformation","K-nearest neighbors algorithm","Level of measurement","Numerical analysis","Self-information","Time complexity","Web Services Interoperability Technology"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["516536755ce1397c89a54a17bc41e606466bac4f","d2c8d1fcc100b53f2e6c5937822bfb59da717ee6","c8181b7d52a5ce762fc5234235902e639ea7cab6","67a69462aed5e394b0ecf201f0b3bb41e932db0c","f9e9112a28583fef52381d4421fccee28f9fae06","62a0cda2635260703692d257fa28b30b38b16dc2"],"id":"3b584f08b7262ea321292f624783796c5e1876f4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b584f08b7262ea321292f624783796c5e1876f4","authors":[{"name":"Lei Gu","ids":["2056103"]},{"name":"Liying Zhang","ids":["47059011"]},{"name":"Yang Zhao","ids":["1720418"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133062"}

However, relatively few interactions between items and users can be observed. Instances of missing user--item entries are caused by the user not seeing the item (although the actual preference to the item could still be positive) or the user seeing the item but not liking it. Separating these two cases enables missing interactions to be modeled with finer granularity, and thus reflects user preferences more accurately. However, most previous studies on the modeling of missing instances have not fully considered the case where the user has not seen the item. Social connections are known to be helpful for modeling users' potential preferences more extensively, although a similar visibility problem exists in accurately identifying social relationships. That is, when two users are unaware of each other's existence, they have no opportunity to connect. In this paper, we propose a novel user preference model for recommender systems that considers the visibility of both items and social relationships. Furthermore, the two kinds of information are coordinated in a unified model inspired by the idea of transfer learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three real-world datasets in comparison with five state-of-the-art approaches. The encouraging performance of the proposed system verifies the effectiveness of social knowledge transfer and the modeling of both item and social visibilities.","inCitations":["f5a784a1646c06592e7de9a214f94eb7d02ff0ff","54c9f5f8c60d31d7e2c184bac068f21f74802717","2f1091ba1d93e4423a301200c80fd0aa0f7a60f6","bf99275a9262865eef19434fa80ebc500e4e61d7"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning and Transferring Social and Item Visibilities for Personalized Recommendation","journalPages":"337-346","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132911"],"entities":["Algorithm","Distrust","Experiment","Information retrieval","Interaction","Personalization","Recommender system","Social network","Unified Model","User (computing)","Visibility (geometry)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","479a7e182c7a6a2e2a802b4085adf91709867d33","c421bec956c05b52f11af0de6e46323b0ee6abb9","29deb8c68de5ed69eb3c4b2234350ad2fdaaf2b8","23bbea130398331084021cc895a132064219b4b1","32f01f0132d456bd271296281b3e1380db39389e","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","9ea6354c67fdc96219b1458641d4ced8e9c42526","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","49ee8a342cb3676f334165aa2dd05fab995c00f7","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","2069c9389df8bb29b7fedf2c2ccfe7aaf82b2832","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","d9c293ae351b371c1ef397ef17c7a71af0a56d78","378321e4a15b29f1277d14b2a32d99d28dbb0683","aad9c378dc1485957ae8d661596462b2ec16ab24","07b01fa102195e4a69383d21f15faadf28bae714","d4321fa4b592dc449935569ce6b24f2e527d1b8b","6808934531ff0d9d3d20a4e71a43a733b556c19c","0e29731a89fff8046ca72e65d22994c425b8a844","9285f3c70c6cab770d2f7d4ccb32ecae0397b134","c99cc4d56aaba932332faf13f1215cf12dc5384f","d5fdc3c0b2049a025091179a73e0e4174105fcd4","3b0c39b323a8cc1a90b3fdee83dad2fd417bd0ce","236c4613771834d3cfb43c450305ade107813198","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20","0aa2a4d259433016ebc899c496faea03c024c0bd","1b8dc814a7384285a52bc005bc54a3b5c87b219d","8d2c04bc3745997fd416429d5a867fb6b28c0af6","1f0d526ffbda42d826de58963273cb20c262465f","24f1a3ec9d02abcd3b5ed7f511b9d8017213954a","06b1cdc6d69ea3b34b5a8b146f8f54367fa10564","2592d9d68f2b29da197c16b2c7f6519ee6304ad6","a795873690b0f99946192f1a62701e390d2ba3a7","d159457153131231e85e9c88971b673ff60b5653","14eb2c5cf9641e431c6715c8abf5e594c2bcc792","7908c007f73ff641961b3c945d145e42a48eddb5","18cac5d010d7a1cf684e9f2bf177843fb8cd1893","25ad8ad3d1549888a4609659bd55ad825c5df82e","37b1ea5fb0ff024b6b49c43843efd77603390836","38e024c97f0e55097919066b7233a5caa622a62f","5720a5015ca67400fadd0ff6863519f4b030e731","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8","bb57a9972cdd37f3abc0a71f70668ba48f3e249a"],"id":"0e443ed401707d9bf95aca485709400d6b5eae63","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0e443ed401707d9bf95aca485709400d6b5eae63","authors":[{"name":"Xiao Lin","ids":["49541551"]},{"name":"Min Zhang","ids":["38898636"]},{"name":"Yongfeng Zhang","ids":["1739818"]},{"name":"Yiqun Liu","ids":["1783406"]},{"name":"Shaoping Ma","ids":["8093158"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132911"}

In particular, the inference on coherent topics can be easily affected by irrelevant contents in articles. Meanwhile, the extreme sparsity of citation networks brings difficulty to a valid citation recommendation. Intuitively, articles with similar topics are more likely to cite each other, and cited articles tend to share similar themes. Motivated from this intuition, we aim to boost the performance of both topic modelling and citation recommendation by effectively leverage this underlying correlation between latent topics and citation networks. To this end, we propose a novel Bayesian deep generative model termed as Neural Relational Topic Model (NRTM), which is composed with a Stacked Variational Auto-Encoder (SVAE) and a multilayer perception (MLP). Specifically, the SVAE utilizes an inference network to learn more representative topics of document contents, which can help to enrich the latent factors in collaborative filtering of citations. Furthermore, the MLP network conducts nonlinear collaborative filtering of citations, which can further benefit the inference of topics by leveraging the knowledge of citation networks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can effectively take advantages of the coherence between topic learning and citation recommendation, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on both tasks.","inCitations":["e6a5da0106ae67ec9c48a59e6043f3afb0ad2799"],"pmid":"","title":"Neural Relational Topic Models for Scientific Article Analysis.","journalPages":"27-36","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271696"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Bayesian network","Black box","Calculus of variations","Citation graph","Coherence (physics)","Collaborative filtering","Encoder","Experiment","Generative model","Memory-level parallelism","Multilayer perceptron","Nonlinear system","Relevance","Scientific literature","Sparse matrix","Topic model","Variational principle"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3bd72deaa02bd8859b872ac42dbbd46be1ddced8","49bef668aff3cc3d470339479dd3cee0b4c9cf4f","50072882718b67aa49595570f8e1eeef5987dec2","2c6fff32b609822718b3784abac17a9f7f4b49cc","af885d19d67f05242b03c52106e0909ad61d2a27","0bc609683155abfe8285fcae176194871af317cf","8eae3003cdc76547c28b8d79715c194e936b475f","4ff0e5ce0d67855e3460ee9212e20cb348861069","6153ae12e2d08c40c779ffa67347956935826688","0b8ea85478a1a896425b824f421fe4aa9725d653","100c730003033151c0f78ed1aab23df3e9bd5283","e6a5da0106ae67ec9c48a59e6043f3afb0ad2799","5aef8a6992fbd56b3309f6b56337d124951bb71d","82db03db1f9f90c46b393c07e4b0e0efb3d9a16f","07a20dbb304551ffb069318b5d6f4c38ddd6d75e","03cb609fcfce6c60cbe3eb0dd8254069bf6d7573","59ac17eadb55a01e48d78cf96e1e0a4668926860","fb641dbada6a27b009cb28a629e7f02fbeec6e10","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","245414e768c3b8c8288ac0651604a36b1a44a446","0f88de2ae3dc2ec1371d1e9f675b9670902b289f","4987baca7365133a03b8a0849bae337d8bf0c3c4","1b2c9f749dd9c128e2130372557f7e109625b2a5","62bb7ce6ae6ed38f0ae4d304d56e8edfba1870d0","4f4837c1f8a194d8b7fe7d6073ce44876f08ad6c","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","1d0890a758145770025cc12d6f48fd46a9c87931","236c4613771834d3cfb43c450305ade107813198","ece016d98b66d21489169cc4c7bbb5973d658e79","17ad7d385564833f682db11240ea3d74a5423256","1c81b1f5d69252489eebea5b2900ed17175dd34d","4672f24bf1828452dc367669ab8a29f79834ad58","58496266bde6ed47a85a886bd0d984fd0de6bce3","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20","278a7ae438a643cf3f32c842f297410a1d079ebd","8577859508af8c039044b5286a99d83f477f10a7","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","9cbf32e778128e1e07e309ec644e1654de9fa98b","8db26a22942404bd435909a16bb3a50cd67b4318"],"id":"818f17444ee7d80c518847d6a0ac55bead6d92a9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/818f17444ee7d80c518847d6a0ac55bead6d92a9","authors":[{"name":"Haoli Bai","ids":["9583912"]},{"name":"Zhuangbin Chen","ids":["9220842"]},{"name":"Michael R.

It involves structuring the question around four types of clinical information: population, intervention, control or comparison and outcome. The PICO framework is used extensively in the compilation of systematic reviews as the means of framing research questions. However, when a search strategy (comprising of a large Boolean query) is formulated to retrieve studies for inclusion in the review, PICO is often ignored. This paper evaluates how PICO annotations can be applied and integrated into retrieval to improve the screening of studies for inclusion in systematic reviews. The task is to increase precision while maintaining the high level of recall essential to ensure systematic reviews are representative and unbiased. Our results show that restricting the search strategies to match studies using PICO annotations improves precision, however recall is slightly reduced, when compared to the non-PICO baseline. This can lead to both time and cost savings when compiling systematic reviews.","inCitations":["3f15ca90565a61930c4222941fbc8a84f6b405b8","fc78ba8cd79026b9a9b189deae4693a668406b69","bbe938bb8fff561727a825d33b8ede4c89348dbf","a481863af0641060b7b420fe2718391cd3531630","0cff5ca9148ae2f76cd02331f68491137b20c400"],"pmid":"","title":"Integrating the framing of clinical questions via PICO into the retrieval of medical literature for systematic reviews","journalPages":"2291-2294","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://koopman.id.au/papers/cikm2017_clitrials_pico.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3133080"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Boolean algebra","Compiler","Framing (World Wide Web)","Framing (social sciences)","High-level programming language","Population","Systematic review"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c0aea7fcdd01f4f468e626f8c32538907ca5b188","9a1a1d6f0ab114d14fc69a91f1981cf8e0848c84","57e53e19875401b90a5138249f128ed33389b9e7","a8c3ba6cd973f2b9d066522038f4ed74ca76530a","3bf4293957bc475818d39c3fbec16db330d3e08a","72911147ea6d5d35b2bcb95662b74f97ba91c3ff","07224f9c21ce65bad806d655b60fc9b33562fe72","3d631913ab2bffc10a8f3ce79708bc5911d7be67","35331328e0fe2987b5a9e90a86199c64a4e3dd4f","40e5c3c9930872c347954c4a3e3535fd4d0e3dad","22cf6a1f456868c3851383052dd4d42aa9c9c937","74950874caae51bd36a963ea451e096cda6e309e"],"id":"f9d7ac1f10cce379b5b30f00ff9dda8e21e2a360","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f9d7ac1f10cce379b5b30f00ff9dda8e21e2a360","authors":[{"name":"Harrisen Scells","ids":["8842143"]},{"name":"Guido Zuccon","ids":["1692855"]},{"name":"Bevan Koopman","ids":["1783566"]},{"name":"Anthony Deacon","ids":["37586984"]},{"name":"Leif Azzopardi","ids":["1716332"]},{"name":"Shlomo Geva","ids":["1707376"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133080"}

The development of models, tools and methods has significantly benefited from the availability of reusable test collections formed through a standardized and thoroughly tested methodology, known as the Cranfield paradigm. Constructing these collections requires obtaining relevance judgments for a pool of documents, retrieved by systems participating in an evaluation task; thus involves immense human labor. To alleviate this effort different methods for constructing collections have been proposed in the literature, falling under two broad categories: (a) sampling, and (b) active selection of documents. The former devises a smart sampling strategy by choosing only a subset of documents to be assessed and inferring evaluation measure on the basis of the obtained sample; the sampling distribution is being fixed at the beginning of the process. The latter recognizes that systems contributing documents to be judged vary in quality, and actively selects documents from good systems. The quality of systems is measured every time a new document is being judged. In this paper we seek to solve the problem of large-scale retrieval evaluation combining the two approaches. We devise an active sampling method that avoids the bias of the active selection methods towards good systems, and at the same time reduces the variance of the current sampling approaches by placing a distribution over systems, which varies as judgments become available. We validate the proposed method using TREC data and demonstrate the advantages of this new method compared to past approaches.","inCitations":["04459cc704c3cdedd47db00d0a87c51dd90fee42","e800bd54d4141295be32b7871132dcf5c147ddc6","fbb9cdd699baf86e9d616b259ada02449c2322ca"],"pmid":"","title":"Active Sampling for Large-scale Information Retrieval Evaluation","journalPages":"49-58","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01709v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01709","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133015"],"entities":["Document","Emoticon","Gibbs sampling","Information retrieval","Linear algebra","Move-to-front transform","Programming paradigm","Relevance","Sampling (signal processing)","Spatial variability","Strati (automobile)","Text Retrieval Conference","Thread pool","Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8194179eccc4a2459f6f369cbed0f2921f7aa4de","421f60f316373875f8887bf58476b7feff4716bd","1260e6de04361b76d751d3a1049dea3f3f54dac8","150a31a1d38d90acefb560c2a42efed1ae67f7f7","8a9f5e61c6c977cdacd85d9a7b14153026619505","3957369af4a66e6bbb7e5df4a90c309e251510b0","67526725638bbb8f389cbaef106756f40cc073b6","5f4f970e18c09aafeafaeb42d729ca243f811db0","663768ac9c3f08b844736a2859eb0688a144f363","54d477a9f652000812e8f6b9f8c9096525d07b05","383a7049cb6287f4748630dc1e57fc92635b19ea","2dd4bd85763d178d444816713859fbbe478554fe","08badaad9669b69b16ce9437d0b2d52b5f33c8dd","0ac1d86fcd8825217e778457e425c143c434641a","a403f1eaf5677fa1000ba57448311f03675969a2","0ddb8af211f2af018e8adf5affe8fc497f056e67","cb7f337708a52da599e489026b09dd54807e0f03","a71896950a2c3bd5c4d30b93f64c6d13cbcf408b","f1f5d598c06669a672f361a9bc140717c915f8d8"],"id":"9f5dbaa21149336b221bd6b50f1d0309e64c5300","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f5dbaa21149336b221bd6b50f1d0309e64c5300","authors":[{"name":"Dan Li","ids":["49621181"]},{"name":"Evangelos Kanoulas","ids":["1713134"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133015"}

Recent state-of-the-art methods represent the relations between users/items and contexts as a tensor, with which it is difficult to distinguish the impacts of different contextual factors and to model complex, non-linear interactions between contexts and users/items. In this paper, we propose a novel neural model, named Attentive Interaction Network (AIN), to enhance CARS through adaptively capturing the interactions between contexts and users/items. Specifically, AIN contains an Interaction-Centric Module to capture the interaction effects of contexts on users/items; a User-Centric Module and an Item-Centric Module to model respectively how the interaction effects influence the user and item representations. The user and item representations under interaction effects are combined to predict the recommendation scores.

Extensive experiments on two rating datasets and one ranking dataset show that the proposed AIN outperforms state-of-the-art CARS methods. In addition, we also find that AIN provides recommendations with better explanation ability with respect to contexts than the existing approaches.","inCitations":["b92c9666de3a3f47af2e3eb8fd0ee7cac51b1645"],"pmid":"","title":"An Attentive Interaction Network for Context-aware Recommendations","journalPages":"157-166","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271813"],"entities":["Aggregate data","Experiment","Interaction network","Nonlinear system","Recommender system"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"c56e07f2301fb7b971aaf08bb6bcd9a610094f49","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c56e07f2301fb7b971aaf08bb6bcd9a610094f49","authors":[{"name":"Lei Mei","ids":["46665847"]},{"name":"Pengjie Ren","ids":["1749477"]},{"name":"Zhumin Chen","ids":["1721165"]},{"name":"Liqiang Nie","ids":["1743245"]},{"name":"Jun Ma","ids":["1683601"]},{"name":"Jian-Yun Nie","ids":["1807485"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271813"}

Predicting the future dynamics of an event at a very early stage is significantly valuable, e.g, helping company anticipate marketing trends before the event becomes mature. However, this prediction is non-trivial because a) social events always stay with \"noise'' under the same topic and b) the information obtained at its early stage is too sparse and limited to support an accurate prediction. In order to overcome these two problems, in this paper, we design an event early embedding model (EEEM) that can 1) extract social events from noise, 2) find the previous similar events, and 3) predict future dynamics of a new event. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale dataset of Twitter data demonstrate the capacity of our model on extract events and the promising performance of prediction by considering both volume information as well as content information.","inCitations":["c538d717dab54b2e9bc8e4bdbf6138a26a24460d","de2c63754f420df0f1a43fa57f7cb6168561080f"],"pmid":"","title":"Event Early Embedding: Predicting Event Volume Dynamics at Early Stage","journalPages":"997-1000","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080700"],"entities":["Emoticon","Experiment","Regular expression","Social media","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["16a651ad4a558d428c18fa92094433de89dbd7fc","04994c7784b915764668b546d60643114f5fc580","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","119a67a62b0e9351e4348d234d9eae4c84f366a3","2abac12c9a4a088475dc6f63bb249ecb539624ec","a47b9bac81a5a4cbee82309edb3333bc7cf2f4e7","e7a7d04463c04b4bc1f472b3d36ff164e9fd92c8","093acf67883f50d5c9c8b1d9b3ef58029218287c","14eb2c5cf9641e431c6715c8abf5e594c2bcc792","0046e28e9e9f973ebeda2c399f5169d2c177db79","0f74ff9c9cd94ee2c874b9e3a979665c1cb4c0ac","a9f45938eb74c293fc78b824993d73a0c3daca69"],"id":"93ca05adf3f644f300621f920c363447bbe56887","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/93ca05adf3f644f300621f920c363447bbe56887","authors":[{"name":"Zhiwei Liu","ids":["40448513"]},{"name":"Yang Yang","ids":["6897666"]},{"name":"Zi Xuan Huang","ids":["2484050"]},{"name":"Fumin Shen","ids":["2731972"]},{"name":"Dongxiang Zhang","ids":["2712862"]},{"name":"Heng Tao Shen","ids":["1724393"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080700"}

Thus, locating the sources of a temporal network is a creative and challenging problem, as the enormous size of many real networks makes it unfeasible to observe the state of all nodes. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to solve this problem, named the backward temporal diffusion process. The proposed algorithm calculates the shortest temporal distance to locate the transmission source. We assume that the spreading process can be modeled as a simple diffusion process and by consensus dynamics. To improve the location accuracy, we also adopt four strategies to select which nodes should be observed by ranking their importance in the temporal network. Our paper proposes a highly accurate method for locating the source in temporal networks and is, to the best of our knowledge, a frontier work in this field.

However, existing works on microblog event extraction, which usually use keywords, entities, or selected microblogs to represent events, are not able to extract details of an event. Based on the view of news report, an event should present detailed news features, i.e., when, where, who, whom, and what. Such news features are helpful for conducting deeply data analysis on microblogs, e.g., competitor monitoring and public crisis discovery. However, the challenge is that the news features of an event on microblogs are usually distributed among different posts because of the short-text property of microblogs. This is much different from extracting news events from Web news pages that usually contain most details of an event. In this paper, we propose a new framework to extract events together with their news features from microblogs. We first extract a set of events from microblogs. Each event is represented as a distribution over four kinds of named entities including location, person name, organization, and time. In addition, the type of each event, i.e., location-related, person-related, or organization-related, is determined by a machine-learning method. In order to obtain the news features of an event, we propose an event-clustering approach that puts together all the relevant events into a cluster. For each cluster, we propose different algorithms to extract the news features of the event reported in the cluster. We conduct experiments on two microblog datasets crawled from a commercial microblogging platform to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results suggest the effectiveness of our proposal.","inCitations":["6271b1a41f9094fbd5237ba995ef7b6001b43785","33b393e7418d3a9bb74368e8315a24aaf393c00d","b9a34fb6a7536d2dca5a0cffd1ff1ad518c361d4"],"pmid":"","title":"News Feature Extraction for Events on Social Network Platforms","journalPages":"69-78","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3e4c/7bb283c3279d288cc4ebdf738c523f16443b.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p69.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054151"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cluster analysis","Experiment","Feature extraction","Machine learning","Named entity","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0d7e335365f4b7a6cb3cca996b59e7adbc967ceb","faf88ddf10c566b267f27210505ea8d6f15376be","ca071e697a9b95e789af29c7648fc50d0fb12d91","6e4276e38cea711bfd7ae0fbfec6ac56f627b131","0c7247c74f946590eca6221d5b9d906d0f4d22c3","0c15871fa4c94d91acafa6bf29d67ac2ce972913","f98ebc10ce8c48020d21cca041de2a3346ce31d9","f16915e4e8d0361b8e577b2123ba4a36a25032ba","a93cb72c5936d6eb5e8d14ff2994cb72ef50cc69","fdf554de477adc128e49697a56ca0541036eafcb","0fefaf2fe831d318380fe3a6eb81254277d7d780","0e01e576818416e81d0f97076d1b61b51b4cf1fe","48aadadafa7122356815d43599ac098903076d00","c8687ca5543bf32a9718627df5cd0fcabaacc61c","91cf9beb696cbb0818609614f4da7351262eac86","bfff4b6afb183f719a74b851da642ccbf6dc0e84","40fec320000645f2137e0f666d1423ff12c4ddaf","6b173db579e05a1bdcf8a84080b8e4a81fe4a2ee","597d11f823463ec1ba874425433ce4884d1c3b4e","83dc3d673da9e2a488a09452b3b2d41e0d558dd6","9fb48ceba187b0279e0c2126da18358b5eac1bd0","3b5298fcf7d090c11ac1450be604bfd492398e8e","9ebab3f77cdeecd4e2e2df7c386ca44e5572efcc","2ff9e6b1a03f968bd96943f38ef184aabd272e9d","b6c93151b4e9f13a184514c7f41fe8e9b6716550","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","17e59da10f0839397e3b923de4fd3fea04777930","9e0df10b4d25dfd16e1e2b29535973861ff61201","55ce907d81337f01aea97b99cbefac2b8fbdfee9","3a327821f706ea8f742c9630c546c5fb3982c2b4","da026bc804cad4367a13d3d3df86de5621d6c914","17d56526a359ab357b3a1e4eae39697b312e3e5e"],"id":"3e4c7bb283c3279d288cc4ebdf738c523f16443b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3e4c7bb283c3279d288cc4ebdf738c523f16443b","authors":[{"name":"Peiquan Jin","ids":["8481239"]},{"name":"Lin Mu","ids":["2104321"]},{"name":"Lizhou Zheng","ids":["1705916"]},{"name":"Jie Zhao","ids":["1701907"]},{"name":"Lihua Yue","ids":["1813306"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054151"}

Embedding a hypergraph into a low-dimensional space and representing each vertex as a vector is useful in various tasks such as visualization, classification, and link prediction. However, most hypergraph embedding or learning algorithms reduce multi-way relations to pairwise ones, which turn hypergraphs into graphs and lose a lot of information. Inspired by Laplacian tensors of uniform hypergraphs, we propose in this paper a novel method that incorporates multi-way relations into an optimization problem. We design an objective that is applicable to both uniform and non-uniform hypergraphs with the constraint of having non-negative embedding vectors.

{"doiUrl":"","venue":"International Semantic Web Conference","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2018,"paperAbstract":"Rules over a Knowledge Graph (KG) capture interpretable patterns in data and various methods for rule learning have been proposed. Since KGs are inherently incomplete, rules can be used to deduce missing facts. Statistical measures for learned rules such as confidence reflect rule quality well when the KG is reasonably complete; however, these measures might be misleading otherwise. So it is difficult to learn high-quality rules from the KG alone, and scalability dictates that only a small set of candidate rules is generated. Therefore, the ranking and pruning of candidate rules is a major problem. To address this issue, we propose a rule learning method that utilizes probabilistic representations of missing facts. In particular, we iteratively extend rules induced from a KG by relying on feedback from a precomputed embedding model over the KG and external information sources including text corpora. Experiments on real-world KGs demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel approach both with respect to the quality of the learned rules and fact predictions that they produce. Motivation. Rules are widely used to represent relationships and dependencies among data items in datasets and to capture the underlying patterns in data [1,16]. Applications of rules include health-care [24], telecommunications [9], manufacturing [2,10,11,12,7], and commerce [17,6]. In order to facilitate rule construction, a variety of rule learning methods have been developed, see e.g. [8] for an overview. Moreover, various statistical measures such as confidence, actionability, and unexpectedness to evaluate the quality of the learned rules have been proposed. Rule learning has recently been adapted for the setting of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) [4,22] where data is represented as a graph of entities interconnected via relations and labeled with classes, or more formally as a set of grounded binary and unary atoms typically referred to as facts. Examples of large-scale KGs include Wikidata [20], Yago [19], and Google\u2019s KG. Since many KGs are constructed from semi-structured knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or harvested from the Web with a combination of statistical and linguistic methods, they are inherently incomplete [15,4]. Rules over KGs are of the form head ← body , where head is a binary atom and body is a conjunction of, possibly negated, binary or unary atoms. When rules are automatically learned, statistical measures like support and confidence are used to assess the quality of rules. Most notably, the confidence of a rule is the fraction of facts predicted by the rule that are indeed true in the KG. However, this is a meaningful measure for rule quality only when the KG is reasonably complete. For rules learned from largely incomplete KGs, confidence and other measures may be misleading, as they do not reflect the patterns in the ? This poster is accompanying our conference paper [5]. missing facts. For example, a KG that knows only (or mostly) male CEOs would yield a heavily biased rule gender(X ,male)← isCEO(X ,Y ), isCompany(Y ), which does not extend to the entirety of valid facts beyond the KG. Therefore, it is crucial that rules can be ranked by a meaningful quality measure, which accounts for KG incompleteness. Example. Consider a KG about people\u2019s jobs, residence and spouses as well as office locations and headquarters of companies. Suppose a rule learning method has computed the following two rules: r1 : livesIn(X ,Y )← worksFor(X ,Z ), hasOfficeIn(Z ,Y ) (1) r2 : livesIn(Y ,Z )← marriedTo(X ,Y ), livesIn(X ,Z ) (2) The rule r1 is quite noisy, as companies have offices in many cities, but employees live and work in only one of them, while the rule r2 clearly is of higher quality. However, depending on how the KG is populated with instances, the rule r1 could nevertheless score higher than r2 in terms of confidence measures. For example, the KG may contain only a specific subset of company offices and only people who work for specific companies. If we knew the complete KG, then the rule r2 should presumably be ranked higher than r1 . Suppose we had a perfect oracle for the true and complete KG. Then we could learn even more sophisticated rules such as r3 : livesIn(X ,Y )← worksFor(X ,Z ), hasHeadquarterIn(Z ,Y ),not locatedIn(Y ,USA). This rule would capture that most people work in the same city as their employers\u2019 headquarters, with the USA being an exception (assuming that people there are used to long commutes). This is an example of a rule that contains a negated atom in the rule body (so it is no longer a Horn rule) and has a partially grounded atom with a variable and a constant as its arguments. Problem. The problem of KG incompleteness has been tackled by methods that (learn to) predict missing facts for KGs (or actually missing relational edges between existing entities). A prominent class of approaches is statistics-based and includes tensor factorization, e.g., [14] and neural-embedding-based models, e.g. [3,13]. Intuitively, these approaches turn a KG, possibly augmented with external sources such as text [23,25,18], into a probabilistic representation of its entities and relations, known as embeddings, and then predict the likelihood of missing facts by reasoning over the embeddings [21]. These kinds of embeddings can complement the given KG and are a potential asset in overcoming the limitations that arise from incomplete KGs. Consider the following gedankenexperiment: we compute embeddings from the KG and external text sources, that can then be used to predict the complete KG that comprises all valid facts. This would seemingly be the perfect starting point for learning rules, without the bias and quality problems of the incomplete KG. However, this scenario is way oversimplified. The embeddings-based fact predictions would themselves be very noisy, yielding also many spurious facts. Moreover, the computation of all fact predictions and the induction of all possible rules would come with a big scalability challenge: in practice, we need to restrict ourselves to computing merely small subsets of likely fact predictions and promising rule candidates. Our Approach. In this work we propose an approach for rule learning guided by external sources that allows to learn high-quality rules from incomplete KGs. In particular, our method extends rule learning by exploiting probabilistic representations of missing facts computed by embedding models of KGs and possibly other external information sources. More formally, let G be a KG, then a probabilistic KG P is a pair P = (G, f) where f is a probability function over the facts (or KGs edges), where we assume f(a) = 1 for each fact a ∈ G, which is already known to be true. Our proposal is to learn rules that not only describe the available graph G well, but also predict highly probable facts based on the function f . The key questions here are how to define the quality of a given rule r based on P and how to exploit it during rule learning for pruning out not promising rules. We define a quality measure μ for rules over probabilistic KGs as a function μ : (r,P) 7→ α, where α ∈ [0, 1]. To measure the quality μ of r over P we propose: \u2013 to measure the quality μ1 of r over G, where μ1 : (r,G) 7→ α ∈ [0, 1], \u2013 to measure the quality μ2 of Gr (i.e., G extended with edges derived using r) by relying on Pr = (Gr, f), where μ2: (G\u2032, (G, f)) 7→ α∈ [0, 1] for G\u2032 ⊇ G is the quality of extensions G\u2032 of G over the signature of G given f , and \u2013 to combine the result as the weighted sum. That is, we define our hybrid rule quality function μ(r,P) as follows: μ(r,P) = (1− λ)× μ1(r,G) + λ× μ2(Gr,P) (3) In this formula μ1 can be any classical quality measure of rules over complete graphs. Intuitively, μ2(Gr,P) is the quality of Gr wrt f that allows us to capture the information about facts missing in G that are relevant for r. The weighting factor λ, we call it embedding weight, allows one to choose whether to rely more on the classical measure μ1 or on the measure μ2 of the quality of the extension Gr. We propose to realize this approach by iteratively constructing rules over a KG and by collecting feedback from a precomputed embedding model, through specific queries issued to the model for assessing the quality of (partially constructed) rule candidates. This way, the rule induction loop is interleaved with the guidance from the embeddings, and we avoid scalability problems. Our machinery is also more expressive than many prior works on rule learning from KGs, by allowing non-monotonic rules with negated atoms as well as partially grounded atoms. Within this framework, we devise confidence measures that capture rule quality better than previous techniques and thus improve the ranking of rules. Contribution. We propose a rule learning approach guided by external sources, and show how to learn high-quality rules by utilizing feedback from embedding models. We implement our approach and present extensive experiments on real-world KGs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach with respect to both the quality of the mined rules and predictions that they produce.

NTCIR-13 OpenLiveQ task offered a shared task in which participants addressed an ad-hoc retrieval task in a cQA service, and evaluated their rankers by multileaved comparison, which combines multiple rankings to generate a single search result page, and simultaneously evaluates the different rankings based on users' clicks on the search result page. Since the number of search result impressions during the evaluation period might not suffice to evaluate a hundred of rankers, we conducted the online evaluation only for rankers that achieved high performance in offline evaluation. The analysis of evaluation results showed that offline and online evaluation results did not fully agree, and a large number of users' clicks were necessary to find a statistically significant difference for every ranker pair. To cope with these problems in large-scale multileaved comparison, we propose a new experimental design that evaluates all the rankers online but intensively tests only the top-k rankers. Simulation-based experiments demonstrated that Copeland counting algorithm could achieve high top-k recall in the top-k identification problem for multileaved comparison.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Challenges of Multileaved Comparison in Practice: Lessons from NTCIR-13 OpenLiveQ Task","journalPages":"1515-1518","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269318"],"entities":["Algorithm","Design of experiments","Experiment","Hoc (programming language)","Online and offline","Question answering","Simulation","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["dbcd79bd7edcdcbb5912a50796fc3c2746729eb5","4d64a2f2cca119b202b19b09ea81ff8fcd9ef9fb","ab0463d8aef96697ad0e4d2c86fd1b41ffd4633d","27f7e9ff722cad915ba228dce80aa51d883c8e9f","4a55a3f1f55062d0696d9df793402641e57d609c","138073aa4be6c00ac2b3c0d5f9adf3fcd0539580","65d9ed718c4e86dfb9ac81c298659ed30b02e174","345b1d6c1a0445af12eaf195bde03a1e2ab7e6f2","01bc8e0e0048255596ec56498fc6b80e4340d244","2167054da02b0bb2dddfccfa2c60866858478da2"],"id":"b5ff01429106da0c70cc29d2b9648f0a78573e59","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b5ff01429106da0c70cc29d2b9648f0a78573e59","authors":[{"name":"Makoto P.

We model these interactions using a Heterogeneous Information Network, and propose a systematic framework for learning their influence weights for a given recommendation task. Further, we address the issue of redundant results, which is very much prevalent in recommender systems. To alleviate redundancy in recommendations we use Vertex Reinforced Random Walk (a non-Markovian random walk) over a heterogeneous graph. It works by boosting the transitions to the influential nodes, while simultaneously shrinking the weights of others. This helps in discouraging recommendation of multiple influential nodes which lie in close proximity of each other, thus ensuring diversity. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by experimenting on real world datasets. We find that, with the weights of relations learned using the proposed non-Markovian random walk based framework, the results consistently improve over the baselines.","inCitations":["296831a95aa306e3d3409d482439d7827c19cc46"],"pmid":"","title":"Fusing Diversity in Recommendations in Heterogeneous Information Networks","journalPages":"414-422","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159720"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Cross entropy","Emulator","Experiment","Interaction","Recommender system","Requirement","Span and div"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["517a461a8839733e34c9025154de3d6275543642","24fafbc64fddff8bad9699343871f5ae5100011e","d637769c7fbc44c2071a8dea36c1fc90206c03b8","5c58ad9a6c09782814a7d048bebd6ef1609c0fb4","84b052f8dfb9a8c4b9235b71b054c82404629c2e","127b97641a03e4f640e5431647c4898b21585c99","24be66032aa1957e6f2ca714b76689093725dafe","7ce622fb9ce47e140c535e7e92cbfeab3d45ebb7","2cbe0ba73d02aabbeefedf841203219796a551b7","10f272220cbca311c8379a72f9d5ba387b18c437","0a2d9ec95a7e5b212be1369f2daa110d09f22821","3baecc04e1341cbae7999e8f61a3946c76504828","02163e9cbebff953680b565e8c248b4ad1c55e82","25f3fcad9a7fbde43fc1c4ec5cf64aaba1766366","d9bcc8ff37fdeae5576fbc8e8eba5076f9a9e7e5","150f79fcec5e466c4ad48c47faf4f7bcfc345c7c","9103b7efcb53c5774d20f079f604c699088c6814","c45dc7d18f2cbe77a0433e0ab7d786a17aaff68c","0caf4a391ee43a8bce9bfcf69b684c442febe42d","a72f412d336d69a82424cb7d610bb1bb9d81ef7c","20dc1890ca65e01856f31edf10126c2ad67e9d04","4c6a809cce7567368721a48d9372eb34d1b72714","5ff655958071026b4d2cc572a3c2e2790ea062f3","70a970b437a6f7e00965517fd11f401ef78a20f5","4999437db9bae36fab1a8336445c0e6b3d1f70c0"],"id":"07ce7b04e6beb1f10d6f95f2e2df0a74e4c2325d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/07ce7b04e6beb1f10d6f95f2e2df0a74e4c2325d","authors":[{"name":"Sharad Nandanwar","ids":["2606602"]},{"name":"Aayush Moroney","ids":["35433573"]},{"name":"M.

For example, one might search [recurring or reoccurring ] to decide between these similar words. While language-related queries are common, they have low click-through rates, lack a strong intent signal, and are generally challenging to study. Perhaps for these reasons, they have yet to be characterized in the literature. In this paper we report the results of two surveys that investigate how, when, and why people use web search to support low-level, language-related tasks. The first survey was distributed by email, and asked participants to reflect on a recent search task. The second survey was embedded directly in search result pages, and captured information about searchers\u2019 intents in-situ. Our analysis confirms that language-related search tasks are indeed common, accounting for at least 2.7% of all queries posed by our respondents. Survey responses also reveal: (1) the range of language-related tasks people perform with search, (2) the contexts in which these tasks arise, and (3), the reasons why people elect to use web search rather than relying on traditional proofing tools (e.g., spelling and grammar checkers).","inCitations":["faed93ae55d2c63945e66b02e231071d0d5cde84","d629121b0129b6fc68fe69bc0769038ae603e2f5"],"pmid":"","title":"Web Search as a Linguistic Tool","journalPages":"549-557","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1261/422d4348b178bdbabfdda44b5401694a467d.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p549.pdf","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/search_linguistic.pdf","http://ryenwhite.com/papers/FourneyWWW2017.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052651"],"entities":["Correctness (computer science)","Email","Embedded system","Grammar checker","High- and low-level","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d79be6f0fee88c0aa1aaf1b21c259776069b440e","f6cc87524e58b4021dfb04596f0edf10358f4288","dd9af33a7262be2eea3cfb18f11e60fc1681c135","1a9f9dadd29466b47dfa3ae4aa9f6b47fce336bd","6a56be8267e1d617b414eacd98041a1ca87124ae","3475c6e71ddc505e7071f5dec037adb33db2c8a4","39bfa264be2d3d739de0198b765889eee60f4b03","84cdaf082eb40611402f5878d4eccf14e0064886","9fa1fa32bf359af7a9d2dd33e384ad2e8027549c","11a52268ea4b6be6104fe12218f570c952216944","18d8f0b1ff6c3cf0f110daa2af9c6f91d260d326","7149d9be2c394dc48c678310af4cbf404c4cf64a","66e30cb10e733c818bd4511201e75c2da4276f73","3805496b3b21a770e7b235444dbcef41a7375898","0883ff294e62403eb5c9bd8d81268ca2a0ea518c","93a28b52f0273be80db1c2c9e7fdb2f03bf45797","90e1ede77d672bf7b582931d379b5ae7334c0a8d","e6d408f935668672c64a9584fa614c24e72335a5","4a08c0e13827b7a4829210b7479d9bd1e9b33be5","19c87fd2b04438562959e2bdc488dedcb6aff21f","15c61fdb1eb2f2f1e78ac11638342b66da71c858","83a421c80b14438387ea466d61b080f63f0c1a65","3a98468f431e7dfbe6b5ac80496785e770d88160"],"id":"1261422d4348b178bdbabfdda44b5401694a467d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1261422d4348b178bdbabfdda44b5401694a467d","authors":[{"name":"Adam Fourney","ids":["3318905"]},{"name":"Meredith Ringel Morris","ids":["34820612"]},{"name":"Ryen W.

In this work, we show that all of the aforementioned models with negative sampling can be unified into the matrix factorization framework with closed forms. Our analysis and proofs reveal that: (1) DeepWalk empirically produces a low-rank transformation of a network's normalized Laplacian matrix; (2) LINE, in theory, is a special case of DeepWalk when the size of vertices' context is set to one; (3) As an extension of LINE, PTE can be viewed as the joint factorization of multiple networks» Laplacians; (4) node2vec is factorizing a matrix related to the stationary distribution and transition probability tensor of a 2nd-order random walk. We further provide the theoretical connections between skip-gram based network embedding algorithms and the theory of graph Laplacian. Finally, we present the NetMF method as well as its approximation algorithm for computing network embedding. Our method offers significant improvements over DeepWalk and LINE for conventional network mining tasks. This work lays the theoretical foundation for skip-gram based network embedding methods, leading to a better understanding of latent network representation

For example, digital analytics streams consist of user online activities (e.g., web browsing activity, commercial site activity, apps and social behavior, and response to ads). An important problem is to \u0080nd frequent joint values (heavy hi\u008aers) of subsets of dimensions. Formally, the data stream consists of d-dimensional items and a k-dimensional subcube T is a subset of k distinct coordinates. Given a theshold γ, a subcube heavy hi\u0088er query Query(T, v) outputs YES if fT (v) ≥ γ and NO if fT (v) < γ/4 where fT is the ratio of the number of stream items whose coordinates T have joint values v. \u008ce all subcube heavy hi\u0088ers query AllQuery(T ) outputs all joint values v that return YES to Query(T, v). \u008ce problem is to answer these queries correctly for all T and v. We present a simple one-pass sampling algorithm to solve the subcube heavy hi\u008aers problem in Õ(kd/γ) space. Õ(·) suppresses polylogarithmic factors. \u008cis is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors based on the lower bound of Liberty et al. [13] In the worst case, this bound becomes Θ(d/γ) which is prohibitive for large d. Our main contribution is to circumvent this quadratic bo\u008aleneck via a model-based approach. In particular, we assume that the dimensions are related to each other via the Naive Bayes model. We present a new two-pass, Õ(d/γ)-space algorithm for our problem, and a fast algorithm for answering AllQuery(T ) in Õ((k/γ)) time. We demonstrate the e\u0082ectiveness of our approach on a synthetic dataset as well as real datasets from Adobe and Yandex. Our work shows the potential of model-based approach to data streams. ∗\u008ce authors are listed alphabetically. \u2020Part of this work was done at Adobe Research. 1 ar X iv :1 70 8. 05 15 9v 2 [ cs .D S] 2 0 Fe b 20 18","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Finding Subcube Heavy Hitters in Analytics Data Streams","journalPages":"1705-1714","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7ea7/73a0c5a53ca6047f031e43f44d33e1532750.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186082","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1708.05159","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05159v2.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Best, worst and average case","Dhrystone","Emoticon","Naive Bayes classifier","Polylogarithmic function","Sampling (signal processing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3cb15cceb032f238d8d4b74339430f11675178e0","a93762759eca1588f143c36bc3fc8a933a04a1b1","34c13d16ef44c2c5b8151d8b78b24fcf8dbc63e5","2abe6b9ea1b13653b7384e9c8ef14b0d87e20cfc","6633a77545bbb20baebdd4d3880b3c49277304ee","4c445ad365e2c35ab47f5030d795062fb41428c5","31b75cee98412d0934cce459aeb5cc157e9a3022","350bc84955a49a9c3e4b4785b100a5db1e3d5e68","08067c31dfaa3c6bbf53499eba003c868377b1a2","5285b2c3880c2fe5a93a9ed213a169facf6d6228","181c9011b2638ae0f95d5adebe730e9d5acb0391","4ddab22ea2cde7420722e76cf99fecb9541c2237","030f6132f6b6b3336ce9b0b29c5ac4c1e368b7dc","8740696a066048f1511767926fcb0fc43d467bcb","7bdb6b8746e9c6678f2fafb07aa2de96f8fc4a14"],"id":"7ea773a0c5a53ca6047f031e43f44d33e1532750","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ea773a0c5a53ca6047f031e43f44d33e1532750","authors":[{"name":"Branislav Kveton","ids":["1681967"]},{"name":"S.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting the evolution of a time series of user activity on the web in a manner that is both accurate and interpretable, using related time series to produce a more accurate prediction. We test our methods in the context of predicting signatures for online petitions using data from thousands of petitions posted on The Petition Site\u2014one of the largest platforms of its kind. We observe that the success of these petitions is driven by a number of factors, including promotion through social media channels and on the front page of the petitions platform. We propose an interpretable model that incorporates seasonality, aging effects, self-excitation, and external effects. The interpretability of the model is important for understanding the elements that drives the activity of an online content. We show through an extensive empirical evaluation that our model is significantly better at predicting the outcome of a petition than state-of-the-art techniques.","inCitations":["ee8554f89f9c22782c73d3cc71e6f5a0bf34448b","342ea71bb70282ffd58f2d3de99324fed2e52613","a44925145f5ec0d067c8a8313efacc1659d0296f"],"pmid":"","title":"Predicting the Success of Online Petitions Leveraging Multidimensional Time-Series","journalPages":"755-764","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9062/571f97af54f8360a7d8110e7ac3b74f3f04a.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052705","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p755.pdf","https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/230203/files/p755-proskurnia.pdf"],"entities":["Antivirus software","Data quality","Online petition","Seasonality","Social media","Time series","Web content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["79f2ae4bf6febeb3c700606f5fbf43b54128469b","543c38d6e7b388ccbbde2a5dc03c8f79928c7154","a772b2d623e90159021d093333c55dbeeac7bd2c","17bf878ea3dfd246547c525792c14a98e9a2e9ab","33da981657b43c4bdb7d9ffaa81703ff3a5066bf","16a651ad4a558d428c18fa92094433de89dbd7fc","eaecc86263068407f78ef6f6505647c5bf754631","a03538812153c8c1562c986eab6a98add9e1af3f","7e0e2bad3e0703452d53315af8701ec39a6f6fca","3b5298fcf7d090c11ac1450be604bfd492398e8e","0814694a247a9b6e38dde34ab95067a63f67e458","1af88a8430fedde965b4cf15488b5a397b9b09f3","2c4ad56fd8e249414fc96db48cd659a003e873fe","06132750ccac50646f7f94ede83cefbb9bbc9095","1d287f70305f3127ed9901e3efcbbef1ab2cea1f","7d52c1381bbfa65b17c617ee7975c4e19a76b737","51bcfef92aef96df37b25bd1ed7c096142107007","119a67a62b0e9351e4348d234d9eae4c84f366a3","95c8a482cf0a57b8d692e30c3eec82c01499688f","b9a3677b42eadd3cef6b1e53d6cdc79e0f28ad7a","57dd9fa985c8ed049ead7509c39c6fbb91d44ae4","1f0d1d1c8d5e4ebef13baed958f1b0b6f9a5caf0","69b08b7cd4dc43b6d4b7bfdc2cbfe35984913169","1073c29baf6d9cfc7b7b028024b58ed070696da3","28fd252c82113e182d77d3fa3d2014d7d8c81994","8c1c21f18da180dedf14b48f5842473d9c9057e3","2fc51707d56f8dc2a8873cdc1ea7b1800260884d","c99cc4d56aaba932332faf13f1215cf12dc5384f","1d10b650dce47e433a465f13789fc5bacc850c18","7333ed97bd8a3676685df72fb5b737c916405847","919000e100bb98c1a2580693be2a33cd60ad429c","451172598f5286f5e39dea0fb51b8c4891e7a409","1d8f2b0292f4b6080a5db2470580273757ba4a70","f6d532d39a6253255b48072a5ff08375f0b6cbb2","11bd4ee4993ae89dafaed935f5749df6b50f780a","0f74ff9c9cd94ee2c874b9e3a979665c1cb4c0ac"],"id":"9062571f97af54f8360a7d8110e7ac3b74f3f04a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9062571f97af54f8360a7d8110e7ac3b74f3f04a","authors":[{"name":"Julia Proskurnia","ids":["3461305"]},{"name":"Przemyslaw A.

Further, due to security and privacy issues, insufficient labelled or user-annotated data (or, ground-truth data) makes the user-classification from GPS traces more complex. In this work, we present a framework which models user movement patterns containing both spatio-temporal and semantic information, generates semantic stay-point taxonomy by analysing GPS traces of all users, summarizes individuals\u2019 GPS traces and clusters users based on the semantics of their movement patterns. To alleviate labelled data scarcity problem while user categorization in a particular region of interest (ROI), we propose a method to transfer knowledge derived from a set of GPS traces of a geographically distanced but similar type of ROI. An extensive set of experiments using real GPS trace dataset of Kharagpur, India and Dartmouth, Hanover, USA have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.","inCitations":["efdaf473dd2758b559b43915bab621b26c565e91","6b2ef94647adf19b0b3b1ff0ef631519d95ba603"],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling of Human Movement Behavioral Knowledge from GPS Traces for Categorizing Mobile Users","journalPages":"51-58","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0c65/0f46b2dd9d496015c993bc0ee645882cb4fd.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p51.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054150"],"entities":["Categorization","Digital footprint","Experiment","Global Positioning System","Ground truth","Privacy","Region of interest","Tracing (software)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6b390ce9897bd7876747d2b08b9540b4d70252c7","2372fde7af96a7006e6d15eecc2ba230c522b235","797b2bcbedc2b650fff4622b88a3d0d13110c19b","24ccdcba118ff9a72de4840efb848c7c852ef247","aebeceb48b24377cad4ad0b887961b21163af9cd","02494fcaa0b8e93c0eac06e49cfa1cc8d2cd7c34","919a75111b22bd6c015ff0c13d18c3a0ed16b4b0","08a8c653b4f20f2b63ac6734f24fa5f5f819782a","2f5ae832284c2f9fe2bba449b961745aef817bbf","b2fa408eaced1fa8f4735ffa504981b30b469891","a25fbcbbae1e8f79c4360d26aa11a3abf1a11972","b3fb91adf78babd998832b99957b9a98605ae325","a0071d1d54865c802dbb718394037c859f52749f","5f1ad89c6fb753a88622fedbc09be95520478ccf","6150675b642d51adc686efdf47a913cbb708cfb1","4909210fc73cc4a432fbe1fd68b8445beb7f02f2","0f98c9d0cd45668907792ef7e7edc2d41fc0191e","1ae0ac5e13134df7a0d670fc08c2b404f1e3803c","01b00ab14357caad4abc208c44f9cc38de805f2a","be5927cacd03d6fbe0606cc571fc5573cec8c9fc","5ef5c0ebc8b8de368838eaf371310bf33c511bc4","6988e79c4d9aa79481ec9a4a2a968438e8e62cc3","f01cc88aac5d2fa8ec7664cc3e2a1a67644a9fa1","2d732c3f798954106f53e60d2c804faf23e09f8a"],"id":"0c650f46b2dd9d496015c993bc0ee645882cb4fd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0c650f46b2dd9d496015c993bc0ee645882cb4fd","authors":[{"name":"Shreya Ghosh","ids":["9222228"]},{"name":"Soumya K.

Recent work has also proposed and evaluated unbounded relevance scales by means of Magnitude Estimation (ME) and compared them with multi-level scales. While ME brings advantages like the ability for assessors to always judge the next document as having higher or lower relevance than any of the documents they have judged so far, it also comes with some drawbacks. For example, it is not a natural approach for human assessors to judge items as they are used to do on the Web (e.g., 5-star rating). In this work, we propose and experimentally evaluate a bounded and fine-grained relevance scale having many of the advantages and dealing with some of the issues of ME. We collect relevance judgments over a 100-level relevance scale (S100) by means of a large-scale crowdsourcing experiment and compare the results with other relevance scales (binary, 4-level, and ME) showing the benefit of fine-grained scales over both coarse-grained and unbounded scales as well as highlighting some new results on ME. Our results show that S100 maintains the flexibility of unbounded scales like ME in providing assessors with ample choice when judging document relevance (i.e., assessors can fit relevance judgments in between of previously given judgments). It also allows assessors to judge on a more familiar scale (e.g., on 10 levels) and to perform efficiently since the very first judging task.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"On Fine-Grained Relevance Scales","journalPages":"675-684","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210052"],"entities":["Bitwise operation","Crowdsourcing","Database normalization","Document","Estimation theory","Experiment","Information retrieval","Relevance","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["890ff7033187d11325329ab12d22e9ca125df94d","2d253a1525e905ddfce45adbdbc0a756ba859ce7","2f83032897feb709ad4103828bbc98a7d84af3e8","603ceb5f315d9b35354df8c06a0afc96382f45a3","3a161be84dff6a42897bb824ebfad720b0c46eaa","3b460e5b77e7822ca584e8d9042ba72e7a2d7425","b0188a7f2a94c88f8640378de32d1a9858c35baa","35634a173dc77967a0c10d0578f10fbf808e0972","f42f3a1912f588329c181dab13dc9319d1aab01c","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","92209b736f4b7df562cf7fc57680750bce2ae1ad","d3d710ca698b8c65a040d2cbb4499360342b4938","1b50c8353d9e4a241a5f4a9c0088eb9c5f593e1f","7c02dd6b59d7185998a7ecdcfeb9d3ad6f5167f3","5955572187a9e6eed9630e2edc3af29b1db3cb29","40c6e880da4fa9d3266e2ce60342b20a1eca106e","f9936518054886fbd5130c2e312a66e347bab8f1"],"id":"c0ed318ac5afd2096411d531f1ad1dfcd86b3517","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c0ed318ac5afd2096411d531f1ad1dfcd86b3517","authors":[{"name":"Kevin Roitero","ids":["3445334"]},{"name":"Eddy Maddalena","ids":["2023411"]},{"name":"Gianluca Demartini","ids":["1694274"]},{"name":"Stefano Mizzaro","ids":["1726978"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210052"}

Considering that many adults use more than three social networks simultaneously, it is reasonable to leverage on this rapidly growing multi-source social media data to boost venue recommendation performance. Another approach to achieve higher recommendation results is to utilize group knowledge, which is able to diversify recommendation output. Taking into account these two aspects, we introduce a novel cross-network collaborative recommendation framework C3R, which utilizes both individual and group knowledge, while being trained on data from multiple social media sources. Group knowledge is derived based on new cross-source user community detection approach, which utilizes both inter-source relationship and the ability of sources to complement each other. To fully utilize multi-source multi-view data, we process user-generated content by employing state-of-the-art text, image, and location processing techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multi-source framework over state-of-the-art baselines and different data source combinations. In addition, we suggest a new approach for automatic construction of inter-network relationship graph based on the data, which eliminates the necessity of having pre-defined domain knowledge.","inCitations":["2d7a758f763dfa56d9745583c6f14a43c582f0e4","d2941a495900c7b8cc46fcb357c0d2c5d7d086e1","6ba4e10d06d9842765a4350bf5abbd3dd095045c","9c9f602b96e716d60061487728fde4088ff07fff","1ab2d67ab1cf651939e4d78248b078f76cc20a02","d6ee1d09acd3f2647622220fea567e330a2216b0","41546d10ee9fb91749aadaebed76ddfa1791326d","a7a3d2a372dae4c3144ab0c9b291e6e26da763ba","7c720ab3a223306097de769d63f4f6d87ca7f402","40238df63d52dd553fb330984273c4447da9e832","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a"],"pmid":"","title":"Cross-Domain Recommendation via Clustering on Multi-Layer Graphs","journalPages":"195-204","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://farseev.azurewebsites.net/slides/SIGIR17_Farseev.pdf","http://farseev.azurewebsites.net/papers/farseevC3R.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080774"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Cluster analysis","Free viewpoint television","Layer (electronics)","Multi-source","Social media","Social network","Spectral clustering","User-generated content","Venue (sound system)","Virtual community"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["315a061bf865e25e27c245f1b1db2ce75b740d57","b94c7ff9532ab26c3aedbee3988ec4c7a237c173","73b4c3ca4ff926dbeaed504050746b70474d7dc6","7076e653d90538138b5f12a0e46a6054e390b5e4","59aad606950349bd64cc220a0df8eca804229865","54dd77bd7b904a6a69609c9f3af11b42f654ab5d","2bf11b00938e73468e3ab02dfe678985212f1aea","127847b3f60f3c807dab392cc157c856d993e6d6","d2941a495900c7b8cc46fcb357c0d2c5d7d086e1","532ded2b9b2021fe09ab164f9dabf97b9fdaa3c8","9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d","2a0556539cdcea37bc3f243fbb6c854abe253fea","58b452c930785a50218811e5fd3819f2a97dde3d","c4c9f645ca334f03b27d6ca646ba7e32fa323aa3","f6a526a4abecd1efb54b925892d2ffa74f643225","48e37374ebff3f99434ba373be6e923b9b948dd3","2d732c3f798954106f53e60d2c804faf23e09f8a","24056f101c601a13024e0c91842d5e3f8aca9372","4e8307b54da6d35a0a4e4946726b621f065664fc","b92c88c552d5a6457defde6427d6fd95f1e1738b","6446405d851f7e940314d2d07aa8ff67b86d1da6","be60825a96e7240ea9a2ee279f591bcbc0939464","bb4c1818159ea11d0d016b0b044d27a76285f913","9b61ec78bb1605143b60a7aafcde9fa39cb7e14a","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","83984e7b3a296f343ae0d7f51869bbdcbe0e816d","b432c44f8931cdcf9810f4270da78d420ca14bd5","931fcff54c667f5996ab07b6f3adc11c77a452cb","c0042d771768a1dc08b611c59e13b47a9ff680f5","b6575f6b6a9e3fde827a2e12bb806a4a00b7a7d5","fc8d2643020c6208cf99778744e07fe01626316c","e6f857af109fd6da45e7282f58159044fc535523","44228f85514537dfe46603da4fc7edd5c0f5ad35","700a692371434e0de4ee831fa13ff984bd2f5ee6","0a7d444963b5979e571641438cc4aeabced8aa0f","70d7688df5e2bfc7aa66516a26b4546344b26c60","2ba601744149bdd7e7d9121f17e7c2b76e28a363","b6943f0e97a7a7c1a71d58521f5ba5abfcf34107","6f813ccf106360cc9c3d6df849cc04d881d0a6e8","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","1437415df29d3927c7851c7a0db0edd4a472d6e1","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701","95a5bc99ed75547e40d10378299f60844dd49eab","1ab2d67ab1cf651939e4d78248b078f76cc20a02","9f0193fe9a2e963968aac8426795226ffa5ef530","78dc785a7f323c0e0afddb18dc0099fcae59b3d5"],"id":"40e59046535c2b5d1a606dbdb33d64a6618b9aba","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/40e59046535c2b5d1a606dbdb33d64a6618b9aba","authors":[{"name":"Aleksandr Farseev","ids":["2229491"]},{"name":"Ivan Samborskii","ids":["3478795"]},{"name":"Andrey Filchenkov","ids":["2517152"]},{"name":"Tat-Seng Chua","ids":["1684968"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080774"}

Work to date has produced extractive summaries using well-known techniques from other areas of NLP. But do users really want these, and do they support users in realistic tasks? We specify an alternative summary type for reader comments, based on the notions of issues and viewpoints, and demonstrate our user interface to present it. An evaluation to assess how well summarization systems support users in time-limited tasks (identifying issues and characterizing opinions) gives good results for this prototype.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"The SENSEI Overview of Newspaper Readers' Comments","journalPages":"758-761","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aedd/21265b199957fc82ffedc0a5a27a5bba1473.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/117787/1/ecir-2017-demo.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_77"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b0fa216e292f1c6fe8610f40718273f3606e006e","e0fe66ea79ee4376b9b86b2e76c8e955923eb8d3","1a003ca6b3150ec205be44fcd39b5d0d051c4463","357eeb54e62f1a2b16e58e85666c614b9ad74667","8db878f1882382c48b544ceea4e694a1afbcee98","479effb344518acdc0fc301af393a75cd8bec40b","579160bd819d174c6d49b0d9f931e8ca12381970","5aa179bcd551ae11d28c2c9209ce4158a1e0214d","e7c7d867a4729953f500db6f8dbd5266b04af9b9"],"id":"aedd21265b199957fc82ffedc0a5a27a5bba1473","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aedd21265b199957fc82ffedc0a5a27a5bba1473","authors":[{"name":"Adam Funk","ids":["9180766"]},{"name":"Ahmet Aker","ids":["1747986"]},{"name":"Emma Barker","ids":["1981704"]},{"name":"Monica Lestari Paramita","ids":["1967368"]},{"name":"Mark Hepple","ids":["2695497"]},{"name":"Robert J.

Increasingly, however, companies are recognising the value of running a bug bounty program, where they will pay 'white hat' hackers to locate and disclose security flaws in their applications in order that they can fix it. This is known as a 'bug bounty' or a 'vulnerability reward program', and at present has seen comparatively little research. This paper introduces two existing research on bug bounties in two areas: as a means of regulating the sale of vulnerabilities; and as a form of crowdsourcing. We argue that the nature of bug bounties makes Web science particularly suitable to drive forward research. We identify gaps in the current literature, and propose areas which we consider to be particularly promising for future research.","inCitations":["1ee82da35c41c436801a3b43180f3a32d6a18f69"],"pmid":"","title":"Web Science Challenges in Researching Bug Bounties","journalPages":"273-277","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3091478.3091517"],"entities":["Bug bounty program","Crowdsourcing","Malware","Software bug","Web science"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["cf46e2267fcd27203f93004b96751a1905491688","07738e922945a8e818de04f329ea3d206012830c","eee019a46ddc9d024f02fe155b6b21240a101d97","16f171f23502b37b334d24d5238fcb3477acd949","5bbb4d94dee3342a48649370e47374f16dbffa5c","8bddd3027bd56bec0f1124ac673ebdec2d4036a7","839895cbaff65dd9abb24a1ec637536374a6bbe9","8936f1e2eb7e644b155290eeaaa6a9d039f7f071","6953420c593842697dd09bc2cf7ffbbaf67a6e8e","9c4e27e560ba03dac553396e7923b291892da22b","ccaca5e998fae8c55203b4d9b3298caab07d762b","670d6bb19ba87b57b3981d80e925ec8bd063e639","4e7f3d6788b1c60bc336c888574892ccf10c8cdf","1e833bab15a975dd71af5fcbbaed4a8df3a5be8a","556e939cbbd6956b670bbf08b0b07bc9b9a9c3b6","a82a10b8c59f330910bdd0e0391c46e2eb89d8d6","7b58fe274f41d1b37795d1a13e73d263787975d0","57d6250fcbc0fe56b309859898e8c7afdf536810","199fbe2ac24ae1b3ffb01a4cefe7469519e8d73a","1b979ad83cf011ff562886f2fae338b47438b259","d34ab6e55b6e602b658799bea5cb6c4edfc51689","82dab04037a243263e6c4869e6d3f49240987c45","625b49ca3e9e9f66d2ef2c0fce6e3851fce83102","306e542a8b6fdf1df9cd4f56db66a41060d90db9","91fa1edf206959b807af51278ef3f43ced36503d","fff1126682fc5ec3846877dfa52c263a2638c5b6","2a9e564d6ed5c689fd5afeb14ed4de76b6da2246","1076820ea04a7e07b5db13cb11bfe04d1ee20672"],"id":"83126e2521264ac967f319900b13897d4230f0a1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83126e2521264ac967f319900b13897d4230f0a1","authors":[{"name":"Huw Fryer","ids":["48281939"]},{"name":"Elena Paslaru Bontas Simperl","ids":["2927032"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091517"}

In contrast to a closed environment, for Open Data and federated query processing algorithms, the data publisher cannot anticipate in advance on specific questions, nor can it deal with a bad costefficiency of the server interface when data consumers increase. When publishing observations from sensors, different fragmentation strategies can be thought of depending on how the historic data needs to be queried. Furthermore, both publish/subscribe and polling strategies exist to publish live updates. Each of these strategies come with their own trade-offs regarding cost-efficiency of the server-interface, user-perceived performance and cpu use. A polling strategy where multiple observations are published in a paged collection was tested in a proof of concept for parking spaces availability. In order to understand the different resource trade-offs presented by publish/subscribe and polling publication strategies, we devised an experiment on two machines, for a scalability test. The preliminary results were inconclusive and suggest more large scale tests are needed in order to see a trend. While the large-scale tests will be performed in future work, the proof of concept helped to identify the technical Open Data principles for the 13 biggest cities in Flanders.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Preliminary Open Data Publishing Strategy for Live Data in Flanders","journalPages":"1847-1853","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6e52/056b17efe221f9d907534ce72a18c8fefb65.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3191650","https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8560021/file/8560023.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Central processing unit","Database","Federated search","Fragmentation (computing)","Perceived performance","Publish\u2013subscribe pattern","Scalability","Sensor","Server (computing)","User agent"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b855a795091628c54f6e24c5c4d9f968459b334d","5c0e4bc81a35fbda06eb5b93a7cf4ac6fc8521ac","31906a2bc21c7871c72da219d712f78988eb73ed","c402d44550a712600fd39221241bdef66f43ecdb","85bb7e0186d4f2c187cccd4c624c28fbcac23b31","365e88f6e79886c49dda75deee03ea09eb9da861","478fbef8568a021c3d91c13128efa19ad719dd88","f98ea07685cf2312db3c5321de1cc885af4748d9","fdbbf8b1a8bd44a78469e3498818a9d00b556fd2","7b811b6768266eca9ed9a41c3f66056f107b6c3b","42f6472db4567cab52ef2f63ae9460d49b4cd6d4","9e9d30a3e65ff942348d068adfa7d5575f38e753","d08df76164d323bea648a4bc0a84203abc8a62a8","343e166d00a16bdbabeada313ee01e19c59bee9a","fde872d2334f1da6bb4e18c64d3c8039bf788a8c","2c7a332ea5a6529cce9fbfc728e8858e301aba79"],"id":"6e52056b17efe221f9d907534ce72a18c8fefb65","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6e52056b17efe221f9d907534ce72a18c8fefb65","authors":[{"name":"Julián Andrés Rojas Meléndez","ids":["40973821"]},{"name":"Brecht Van de Vyvere","ids":["40976640"]},{"name":"Arne Gevaert","ids":["40977607"]},{"name":"Ruben Taelman","ids":["3403873"]},{"name":"Pieter Colpaert","ids":["2370758"]},{"name":"Ruben Verborgh","ids":["1723397"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3191650"}

For instance, with the ubiquitous 24/7 availability of mobile devices, the number of search engine queries on mobile devices has reportedly overtaken that of queries on regular personal computers. In this paper, we consider the task of multimodal question answering over structured data, in which a user supplies not just a natural language query but also an image. Our system addresses this by optimizing a non-convex objective function capturing multimodal constraints. Our experiments show that this enables it to answer even very challenging ambiguous entity queries with high accuracy.","inCitations":["96669256524067c791e2da108eefbf2c4bd76b7c"],"pmid":"","title":"Multimodal Question Answering over Structured Data with Ambiguous Entities","journalPages":"79-88","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/beb0/e92bc6a3d07b699d9c1142a2b92123dea132.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p79.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054135"],"entities":["Augmented reality","Constrained optimization","Constraint (mathematics)","Convex function","Data model","Digital media","Entity","Experiment","Information needs","Knowledge base","Knowledge management","Mathematical optimization","Mobile device","Multimodal interaction","Natural language user interface","Optimization problem","Personal computer","Question answering","User-generated content","Web search engine","Web search query","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1be36dc306bba1d0cabd3f8611c2c4d609a68c06","2c82ae113a47b9499aad22e32906885c8244c1a1","eb2d1d406405537773e70f7e949df656ee8779aa","042db0977555fcd7d5eac67b26695cd918ecb44c","8c39c16e9140ad7f5e1e8949714bd3dbefd7147c","8e95526a02d6ddbadd11612baed19c78f504915b","9563d6fafb6ba09c082a57e8d9b31494029a45ac","eb17ae54ad729d06b5b21ac4555f35b8946581b5","8f801cc9b9ce8bc4cae5ad8e82e4cc7036f57600","cb4d277a51da6894fe5143013978567ef5f805c8","32b274c6139d9d28ad8dcbcf768386b9d27a9e51","b899edf9df955b64d2e2b0f6adb4b861a94d5e4d","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","45f51f6ef571747cff87af8f166d4defb3b7504d","89d025804988944d6fa4e95f49bff011b33d1418","2496f4442e71d681a0f157c1ad930fb73d42f1f9","568cff415e7e1bebd4769c4a628b90db293c1717","f9a231f25af733419c6ff7b865751fecb6c50b7d","80c2d8c691b09f8b4e53f512b9d2641b49fda935","bb20f121c979b535bbeade5ac06676d627d4ad7d","968ab65077c4be1c1071120052b2e4b4f3d3c59a","b162c99873c929447bb7ff48d454867aa83f375c","c4778a753fc424f0a7710d950e8478e06277c807","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","b4d89f932350c03ce17e4c8232784e8078290509","004f7e667f5bb3b0d996d6a14d67a123cb61f7b2","cfd89e17465c9640e2f9dcde52d129f380cb6735","434d7ca6ae0e824ad27867b9ccfa3af6daeae05a","707c69c6df97b882a21e631bb15f475f19cc01f5","a8b90f255017220fc51fd694e9b461cec0625b2b","c5d1dd6706fc8e264d79b7b0ee8bfc0f1d73b1e6","23355a1cb7bb226654e2319dd5ce9443284a694b","14318685b5959b51d0f1e3db34643eb2855dc6d9","44657edc9ade2fdbf6636e6f0d56e7d1e5c2feef","3cfa5557319af426f459acc50b94e4d4de436616"],"id":"beb0e92bc6a3d07b699d9c1142a2b92123dea132","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/beb0e92bc6a3d07b699d9c1142a2b92123dea132","authors":[{"name":"Huadong Li","ids":["47892708"]},{"name":"Yafang Wang","ids":["1706513"]},{"name":"Gerard de Melo","ids":["1732213"]},{"name":"Changhe Tu","ids":["1930739"]},{"name":"Baoquan Chen","ids":["1748939"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054135"}

Significant progresses have been made by deep neural networks. However, background information and hidden relations beyond the context, which play crucial roles in human text comprehension, have received little attention in recent deep neural networks that achieve the state of the art in ranking QA pairs. In the paper, we propose KABLSTM, a Knowledge-aware Attentive Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, which leverages external knowledge from knowledge graphs (KG) to enrich the representational learning of QA sentences. Specifically, we develop a context-knowledge interactive learning architecture, in which a context-guided attentive convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to integrate knowledge embeddings into sentence representations. Besides, a knowledge-aware attention mechanism is presented to attend interrelations between each segments of QA pairs. KABLSTM is evaluated on two widely-used benchmark QA datasets: WikiQA and TREC QA. Experiment results demonstrate that KABLSTM has robust superiority over competitors and sets state-of-the-art.","inCitations":["b072513aab92e64320dd6abccf132d79ccdefa70","dd29e5b9e6ab9396daa4cf545b4dfef4e64b6be4"],"pmid":"","title":"Knowledge-aware Attentive Neural Network for Ranking Question Answer Pairs","journalPages":"901-904","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210081"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Benchmark (computing)","Convolutional neural network","Deep learning","Google Questions and Answers","Information retrieval","Kasparov's Gambit","Knowledge Graph","List comprehension","Long short-term memory","QA & UX Manager","Question answering","Software quality assurance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4d0f00b4b8287c74f790f0156815471e6182fbaa","68e4aedc69518d8db2f143bd3952668aa41c762c","1261fe9bfde319abcc5d011bc70f7e7547b5258f","bc34eee11d8ddba18a262a637ea336322c93ba6c","c051cfabf26e75e4af2edfeec86f633a7d76590f","c48e5ae2cdeb2b0b52268ad5099d7c27a76c2e6b","52956422f86722aca6becb67ea4c3ad61f0c1aea","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","828dbeb7cf922dc9b6657dd169b8d26d2b58eedb","28e94fca05a18f3611d8ab455f23bdefb88a7518","03fe39386ce90e10ec87f10e00532c5cf30b244f"],"id":"acb19932620452deab36b24a24b139f17224f469","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/acb19932620452deab36b24a24b139f17224f469","authors":[{"name":"Ying Shen","ids":["48234803"]},{"name":"Yang Deng","ids":["48362872"]},{"name":"Min Yang","ids":["48857157"]},{"name":"Yaliang Li","ids":["2694924"]},{"name":"Nan Du","ids":["1714086"]},{"name":"Wei Fan","ids":["46193609"]},{"name":"Kai Lei","ids":["1784737"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210081"}

When assigning a reviewer to evaluate an article, the assignment should be aware of conflicts of interest (COIs) such that the reviews are fair to everyone. However, existing conference management systems simply ask reviewers and authors to declare their explicit COIs through a plain search user interface guided by some simple conflict rules. We argue that such declaration system is not enough to discover all latent COI cases. In this work, we study a graphical declaration system that visualizes the relationships of authors and reviewers based on a heterogeneous co-authorship network. With the help of the declarations, we attempt to detect the latent COIs automatically based on the meta-paths of a heterogeneous network.","inCitations":["c8c74affc67e764d55551bf24d090e6966138290"],"pmid":"","title":"Conflict of Interest Declaration and Detection System in Heterogeneous Networks","journalPages":"2383-2386","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133134","http://gatterbauer.name/download/cikm2017-COI_detection"],"entities":["Declaration (computer programming)","Fairness measure","Graphical user interface","IBM Notes","Logistic regression","Open road tolling","Semiconductor industry","UMAC","Venue (sound system)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["07122d1bac68a594aa851dafca3014643730c09b","70a970b437a6f7e00965517fd11f401ef78a20f5","10f272220cbca311c8379a72f9d5ba387b18c437","8cfffe4f41b37c7325ba912f98254075602934c8","a3d86c97ffc750dc98ad6717cbc63979926e97a2"],"id":"9b5d097df00a460ba9c198d1c0d3d95e3332939c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9b5d097df00a460ba9c198d1c0d3d95e3332939c","authors":[{"name":"Siyuan Wu","ids":["2120793"]},{"name":"U Hou LeongHou","ids":["1713638"]},{"name":"Sourav S.

On the contrary, multistream classification problem involves two independent non-stationary data generating processes. One of them is the source stream that continuously generates labeled data. The other one is the target stream that generates unlabeled test data from the same domain. The distribution represented by the source stream data is biased compared to that of the target stream. Moreover, these streams may have asynchronous concept drifts between them. The multistream classification problem is to predict the class labels of target stream instances by utilizing labeled data from the source stream. This kind of scenario is often observed in real-world applications due to scarcity of labeled data. The only existing approach for multistream classification uses separate drift detection on the streams for addressing the asynchronous concept drift problem. If a concept drift is detected in any of the streams, it uses an expensive batch technique for data shift adaptation. These add significant execution overhead, and limit its usability. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution for multistream classification by fusing drift detection into online data shift adaptation. We study the theoretical convergence rate and computational complexity of the proposed approach. Moreover, empirical results on benchmark data sets indicate significantly improved performance over the baseline methods.","inCitations":["48d91342e632c64d6c27e8fe40b946f90a3381e7","fe5940d77740ca70c50c19029bc387d25db434c0"],"pmid":"","title":"FUSION: An Online Method for Multistream Classification","journalPages":"919-928","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132886","http://utdallas.edu/~hamlen/ahsanul17cikm.pdf"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Benchmark (computing)","Computational complexity theory","Concept drift","Ensemble learning","Overhead (computing)","Rate of convergence","Stationary process","Test data","Usability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8fc1b05e40fab886bde1645208999c824806b479","384bb3944abe9441dcd2cede5e7cd7353e9ee5f7","6b9500ec0f027f8b114105882ccc39343f081a2f","07117994f0971b2fc2df95adb373c31c3d313442","1c1623c9915dfed11cb3a42954550c1a3d919742","6d8c9fcce8177d6f8d122d653c7d32d7624d6714","89d1aac26800c4a6c2ffad7d01ae75371522a718","1101c4cca31b1a3d6fbeeb2d5efbe34036f6c1c3","27a7a1caa9b7457c7553739e10be9260355c982c","e39a2111e8d308c07f85bea297d3e75f2180bd32","0f16f6f478b5c788dce466eb50e36c612273c36e","167153bf47717f74c9eb291208c7dc92e4646540","12fa4a3ee546ba8eeb0b88b06bcb571d65d91cc4","d031315d65ccb1e0ac97e6122331bd3d9fb619c8","add39272e8762cea5a24c95ad238af5d61c3bd54","ee4df1bad0cae002c98d039c3ba4ce80bfb06d7d","af7188cb346931dcd68aac2d3a05c59507cb841d","1d768f5179160d7300cf62169c324d8afd8db657"],"id":"062ebc50ab91959db18a96f202c575aeec604596","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/062ebc50ab91959db18a96f202c575aeec604596","authors":[{"name":"Ahsanul Haque","ids":["2849932"]},{"name":"Zhuoyi Wang","ids":["48708508"]},{"name":"Swarup Chandra","ids":["2093123"]},{"name":"Bo Dong","ids":["3852923"]},{"name":"Latifur Khan","ids":["1685603"]},{"name":"Kevin W.

Can we design an online algorithm to help them decide when to post to stay at the top? In this paper, we address this question as a novel optimal control problem for jump stochastic differential equations. For a wide variety of feed dynamics, we show that the optimal broadcasting intensity for any user is surprisingly simple ? it is given by the position of her most recent post on each of her follower's feeds. As a consequence, we are able to develop a simple and highly efficient online algorithm, RedQueen, to sample the optimal times for the user to post. Experiments on both synthetic and real data gathered from Twitter show that our algorithm is able to consistently make a user's posts more visible over time, is robust to volume changes on her followers' feeds, and significantly outperforms the state of the art.","inCitations":["730f0604a490fd911170adc5d5c060bef79017fd","01edf0528e2f2526b396d9b5d0e54ebdb8f83bb5","24e56a1b8e1d4f32efc64a220da19f948a2942e6","45def36425c5db0a5b4bb75a8d5175e6c48727d8","57703ce4befb07cec2182f2e70d38f7281266d01","03bb20201fc53cdb428e4c335f50e91bd113930a","ce04e3232aea12b6d0d37ee2e7c1e4072f6365a4","e3db80d03afe62bd0d174c33492f08a49d23bc4e","0a710c257c022d3eef1f9d55a346209b51487134","1539ad035edd4c3b31f465d60302259355688a74","1d5031cd348f696e6eb15e1cf211fcd35559a74f","8eabb3a9bffb882030e0e72755ccbed4bc88bb81","451a2064617515e4499510c2c06f1fdb94775f4e","0ab6b5b8652e1b4d33ea035038301acc7293cfd9","6d5b35b3d29552d5ddf06340fec82495b3d05cd2","635784e08bca06f28de65b1d093522729a9501a5"],"pmid":"","title":"RedQueen: An Online Algorithm for Smart Broadcasting in Social Networks","journalPages":"51-60","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05773","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018684","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05773v1.pdf"],"entities":["Adversary (cryptography)","Experiment","Noise shaping","Online algorithm","Online and offline","Optimal control","Social network","Synthetic intelligence","Turing degree"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c08206b44dd1f0ea54bd073e4effaf2e4483169b","5d9dacdadf8ef8a504fe92644bde5293fde2c7f5","47f193b934e38fb3d056aa75fabaca4d60e93055","14f66261a1864f073b773be35cd2472230928b0a","0318f19753bd9d42128150d9a7d27dda0a8da96e","28bf0df09f97e7ef9108e71b45fe1b9a7aa201e2","66bb61b78999bd7a02b552318736ec3f6d64b4a7","199ec5336aa99e68a6fcabd45cd022dffd99d968","0d7c4a408b1bfedd0c19db92812fbee0515d564d","0034babf24dad5919bb42c80836bc0ea255cf204","0a3858df9b27de264f39d774e26e1be50ef28337"],"id":"8b60a0321f31eda486883600eaa9d7226fda8e63","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8b60a0321f31eda486883600eaa9d7226fda8e63","authors":[{"name":"Ali Zarezade","ids":["1944129"]},{"name":"Utkarsh Upadhyay","ids":["10515643"]},{"name":"Hamid R.

Existing approaches for popularity prediction fall into two paradigms: feature-based approaches and generative approaches. Feature-based approaches extract various features (e.g., user, content, structural, and temporal features), and predict the future popularity of information by training a regression/classification model. Their predictive performance heavily depends on the quality of hand-crafted features. In contrast, generative approaches devote to characterizing and modeling the process that a piece of information accrues attentions, offering us high ease to understand the underlying mechanisms governing the popularity dynamics of information cascades. But they have less desirable predictive power since they are not optimized for popularity prediction. In this paper, we propose DeepHawkes to combat the defects of existing methods, leveraging end-to-end deep learning to make an analogy to interpretable factors of Hawkes process --- a widely-used generative process to model information cascade. DeepHawkes inherits the high interpretability of Hawkes process and possesses the high predictive power of deep learning methods, bridging the gap between prediction and understanding of information cascades. We verify the effectiveness of DeepHawkes by applying it to predict retweet cascades of Sina Weibo and citation cascades of a longitudinal citation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepHawkes outperforms both feature-based and generative approaches.","inCitations":["72e02298d9ef86c0d36abe1261a514884c8dd7da","ee8554f89f9c22782c73d3cc71e6f5a0bf34448b","271dc48e72b8e13eda52a31cf73521321ff61833","5c43e5822d1a512e19f7331c60f429bded2dc426","216d1eb49525d4c0b6bc58b52b903fc2313da912"],"pmid":"","title":"DeepHawkes: Bridging the Gap between Prediction and Understanding of Information Cascades","journalPages":"1149-1158","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132973"],"entities":["Bridging (networking)","Deep learning","End-to-end principle","Experiment","Information cascade","Microsoft Customer Care Framework","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4c0827bd2bf4652a615b0838f9ec7965b9b4b2ea","894fd6b1a71cc22551584247a836cda69379548f","0738bee349250853d79fc6ccd3dc09aa794ac120","3a0835dd1c1436bc3ff5894144d2c6b636742925","21aae3d9e624ebda090f7af1410c4ea10476001d","2c4ad56fd8e249414fc96db48cd659a003e873fe","205124588c4decdfc3428e1678b0bc01e70eb73b","47310b4e14990becd5d473a07092ded4df2fbef1","06132750ccac50646f7f94ede83cefbb9bbc9095","119a67a62b0e9351e4348d234d9eae4c84f366a3","97b5190600b26d6fee0772cb3207b23a6dc5c267","dfdf5fdb63283db8623c77cc0e65c6b233d83169","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","1d287f70305f3127ed9901e3efcbbef1ab2cea1f","17af7a595bd305bc9a264a3d0480b0a6ae1238ad","23fac3dc1499f39c44049ece61a4a48df5363e4e","865709d126235a5fd3911f541e64cf64cab1da8c","5ee3da8b1577de0de75e45ba498095c08bc349ff","ad14eef3417749207388edc424907919ee5566e1","57dd9fa985c8ed049ead7509c39c6fbb91d44ae4","0252d5966b832d10250e44dcfe441fb4fa7ffaae","a772b2d623e90159021d093333c55dbeeac7bd2c","1d35171758a147e1bf3f0b2bc30d6d3a2077ae0c","2fc51707d56f8dc2a8873cdc1ea7b1800260884d","db8aa51c1d6f90f2f83cc0dcd76ec8167294b825","ad56e528d80ce5e47d75a2d07d2eb398fee7f595","052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","037c6a50a4a7cae1998d944ae2991c986731912a","14af018e67a16b20a12acb311f4881cc2f257ee9","503755661e0b15e4357a5bdd8e8070fc6cb2fb9f","18fb605aff0296c2bc7515fdc258a634e53a3024","6870fddd3edf154ac73b42abf09b2ec12667cf30","c5d7763707d3504f0dec73c39424ec688b8692a3","f6d532d39a6253255b48072a5ff08375f0b6cbb2","11bd4ee4993ae89dafaed935f5749df6b50f780a","1073c29baf6d9cfc7b7b028024b58ed070696da3"],"id":"7ac58552d17190ccdfc3313833911b3d758b8c58","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ac58552d17190ccdfc3313833911b3d758b8c58","authors":[{"name":"Qi Cao","ids":["46632474"]},{"name":"Huawei Shen","ids":["2476503"]},{"name":"Keting Cen","ids":["3396545"]},{"name":"Wentao Ouyang","ids":["8676190"]},{"name":"Xueqi Cheng","ids":["1717004"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132973"}

The nature of relations between two graphs can be divided into two categories: the vertex relation and the link relation. Many studies focus on modeling the vertex relation between graphs and try to find the vertex correspondence between two graphs. However, the link relation between graphs has not been fully studied. Specifically, we model the cross-graph link relation as cross-graph dependence, which reflects the dependence of a vertex in one graph on a vertex in the other graph. A generic problem, called Graph Dependence Minimization (GDM), is defined as: given two graphs with cross-graph dependence, how to select a subset of vertexes from one graph and copy them to the other, so as to minimize the cross-graph dependence. Many real applications can benefit from the solution to GDM. Examples include reducing the cross-language links in online encyclopedias, optimizing the cross-platform communication cost between different cloud services, and so on. This problem is trivial if we can select as many vertexes as we want to copy. But what if we can only choose a limited number of vertexes to copy so as to make the two graphs as independent as possible? We formulate GDM with a budget constraint into a combinatorial optimization problem, which is proven to be NP-hard. We propose two algorithms to solve GDM. Firstly, we prove the submodularity of the objective function of GDM and adopt the size-constrained submodular minimization (SSM) algorithm to solve it. Since the SSM-based algorithm cannot scale to large graphs, we design a heuristic algorithm with a provable approximation guarantee. We prove that the error achieved by the heuristic algorithm is bounded by an additive factor which is proportional to the square of the given budget. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs show that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform the well-studied graph centrality measure based solutions. Furthermore, we conduct a case study on the Wikipedia graphs with millions of vertexes and links to demonstrate the potential of GDM to solve real-world problems.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Minimizing Dependence between Graphs","journalPages":"1827-1836","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132931"],"entities":["Algorithm","Approximation","Approximation algorithm","Bioinformatics","Bioinformatics","Centrality","Cloud computing","Combinatorial optimization","Eurographics","Experiment","Heuristic (computer science)","Link relation","Mathematical optimization","Multidimensional Digital Pre-distortion","NP-hardness","Optimization problem","Provable prime","Submodular set function","Synthetic data","Synthetic intelligence","Time complexity","Utility functions on indivisible goods","Vertex (geometry)","WHAT IF","Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["46fe4a571440a79305c87b77df357e2a163eee24","1e8462d33356770adaa8ab2f11350d0af2c5638e","d066dcccf868a5e74c0635d41803c9a013290e3c","10aa9ee7caaf9381b6a0468ae899a9729824a6b7","19f298d5602524c7be2c52d5e4762246c962f2e6","0103f3c61058c4ad81798e9ad10e51bd8d792315","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","21a56bfed90e46a74415329024cd5194dbecf284","480c75d9674cebda4b2e65309b791e078e580e27","71affe0d9489be0ecba667f568b1a0bcd9ee3af3","61745e0a984e8fd9c45f545c3c83f7b99b110505","41bc68dc62cfccf0c4171a03aa36d406f0ffa048","80fabba3f2ce3f64e30ade4448121de8ba1f58be","c45dc7d18f2cbe77a0433e0ab7d786a17aaff68c","06457cda2cb16f413ac3ae2103902d58190aeb72","259636581377f3cd31758d6a2508d2196a0b4df8","4e4cd4b00660510df79a2386c732ee0f3a344435","0a6aa9468e6111450cc46bb8a12b8aab77b6557f","8fdd71b6af75e71d4bcca20eb3defc6ce4424237","261efb84ba57c23a6f7f9816aa8870a57641b967"],"id":"2a5c9141b4a4ec7699a9fa481c275c3fb05be7c7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2a5c9141b4a4ec7699a9fa481c275c3fb05be7c7","authors":[{"name":"Yu Rong","ids":["50047773"]},{"name":"Hong Cheng","ids":["1702190"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132931"}

As the practice evolved in the Semantic Web community, a demand for more complex geometries and geospatial query capabilities came about as a consequence of integrating traditional GIS and geo-data into the Linked Data cloud. However, recent projects have revealed that, in practice, these established techniques have major shortcomings that limit their storage, transmission and query potential. In this position paper, we examine these shortcomings, propose to treat geometries similar to how other binary data are stored and referenced on the Semantic Web, namely by representing them as resources via URIs instead of RDF literals, and demonstrate the utility of precomputing topological relations rather than computing them on-demand by arguing that end users are most o\u0089en interested in topology and not raw geometries.

In this study, we propose a novel solution, cross-language citation recommendation via Publication Content and Citation Representation Fusion (PCCRF). PCCRF can learn a representation function by mapping the publications, from various languages and repositories, to a low-dimensional joint embedding space from both content semantic and citation relation viewpoints. The proposed method can optimize the publication representations by maximizing the likelihood of observing network neighborhoods (which are generated by a semi-supervised random walk algorithm) of publications.

Currently, many existing approaches formulate the DAR problem ranging from multi-classification to structured prediction, which suffer from handcrafted feature extensions and attentive contextual dependencies. In this paper, we tackle the problem of DAR from the viewpoint of extending richer Conditional Random Field (CRF) structured dependencies without abandoning end-to-end training. We incorporate hierarchical semantic inference with memory mechanism on the utterance modeling at multiple levels. We then utilize the structured attention network on the linear-chain CRF to dynamically separate the utterances into cliques. The extensive experiments on two primary benchmark datasets Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWDA) and Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act (MRDA) datasets show that our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art solutions to the problem.","inCitations":["9d2f9442e3226cc071ea09a9f7f1eaa0114714b2","f6ec1fa2def777848485f13e4f9fcda04d6b9330","dd601445ddd4912316b9667386c1550bb57f092f","0b6c64acee882e323cb88aab29140e6bceb8450e","bac495af48328fcdf53992057ca95eb7b0dd6ad6"],"pmid":"","title":"Dialogue Act Recognition via CRF-Attentive Structured Network","journalPages":"225-234","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05568v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05568","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209997"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Clique (graph theory)","Computer science","Conditional random field","ENCODE","End-to-end principle","Experiment","MRDA (slang)","Structured prediction","Telephone switchboard","Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link","Yao graph"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["689b101511e080f9eeca1c6ee8829b0ae75aa4d1","771fe78bd1dc02f1f8601b35fa02d584f238d16c","0f3b8eba6e536215b6f6c727a009c8b44cda0a91","87fa4773b2751e3bbefd4a0064ae0308454e8e87","1967ad3ac8a598adc6929e9e6b9682734f789427","033eb044ef6a865a53878397633876827b7a8f20","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","f6fd84f9eb41bb8a4e4d2ae4fe1339258e271bc0","dc0a80aee19c7987172c079c5598e19e86d41a07","e1b93001202afd674cc3542cdb5599bff0d10157","3e38f451f265a8eda99878ee351a89f18bf26044","20a599c5f152c3f135b9b55a667e64c93ec8d477","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","3b41e25f7b30b7e674797081a8e0277947231ebb","6b8b2075319accc23fef43e4cf76bc3682189d82","1fd6d08f1adcaa512b07c1b6919422d786d1697a","06d51deada6e771a2571807a47dd991120c8dd1a","008b3fd9ea599a840d9e2eadccedaf2e4bf89099","0a7c04c252621633992810bf0f184f287610c461","6eef62288da1c73cb57ed0787b5db12151ae2c29","277c68718ebdf79be1d79cb957ac468fa4519277","815718fe8cda56346da0e318ffd2cd25b68d77f6","1b94c49c119c7490d2df6a2dd093e5ddd8bfba14","aa33f96e37f5222ef61403ac13dab54247120bdb","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","18adc43d97e5f77e7885689459a0e920362c35ea","12e20e4ea572dbe476fd894c5c9a9930cf250dd2","ba54877e22a5ef4e7c8340f380ffdd3eb0295391","72bfcab78f34d0d15ec4ed1d15cd63f77e8b979a","436c3119d16ce2e3c243ffe7a4a1a5dc40b128aa","0dd23c2f192747e2dc0fd04a7afc4d48f91c0a95","83bce397ca0aaa9e47bde4511fe84d5ebda80210","fd4a431e36f4bb87269239405edee619c4cb7ef3","25a6e99e25991f6f8e3dda5b8fc6f80aa03cb31c","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","ce44330516e484548342623a967cc3a54cfaa504","57e1eeb8e4f442f4433670b50167404c14566e97","d00c31df3c50cd57eba2ad39709e1cb14a208246","a82f2e17805d05df7a3539f2efde570a96bc7d99","3228bb307685af9aba1bc5b3e71ea81255467a82","388832b036ee680713458069da3afd2fe2dc762f"],"id":"940d7b18e922bfebb8988f9e6ceb2663944818d3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/940d7b18e922bfebb8988f9e6ceb2663944818d3","authors":[{"name":"Zheqian Chen","ids":["8157472"]},{"name":"Rongqin Yang","ids":["27542224"]},{"name":"Zhou Zhao","ids":["2322317"]},{"name":"Deng Cai","ids":["1724421"]},{"name":"Xiaofei He","ids":["3945955"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3209997"}

To facilitate the search for sentences or text regions for many knowledge-centric tasks such as information extraction, question answering, and relationship extraction, it is required that one can query large annotated document collections interactively. However, currently such an indexing infrastructure that scales to millions of documents and provides fast query execution times does not exist. To alleviate this problem, we describe how we can effectively index layers of annotations (e.g., part-of-speech, named entities, temporal expressions, and numerical values) that can be attached to sequences of words. Furthermore, we describe a query language that provides the ability to express regular expressions between word sequences and semantic annotations to ease search for sentences and text regions for enabling knowledge acquisition at scale. We build our infrastructure on a state-of-the-art distributed extensible record store. We extensively evaluate GYANI over two large news archives and the entire Wikipedia amounting to more than fifteen million documents. We observe that using GYANI we can achieve significant speed ups of more than 95x in information extraction, 53x on extracting answer candidates for questions, and 12x on relationship extraction task.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"GYANI: An Indexing Infrastructure for Knowledge-Centric Tasks","journalPages":"487-496","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271745"],"entities":["Archive","Data model","Information extraction","Interactivity","Knowledge acquisition","Named entity","Numerical analysis","Query language","Question answering","Regular expression","Relationship extraction","Temporal expressions","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["44db9d5022ccb71a9cf3539347fb678db9dfe227","beccbf84adb83d0a8b8aefcfa9962da8217415f2","1ff3c1919da30c331166b1f9e1ef26c5c559fc3c","2338f7162dc1491e343a78c1ad24c11db666c654","6a9619ee1175c8ac3e63be1638b7455637f3252f","9f8eb04dbafdfda997ac5e06cd6c521f82bf4e4c","5a434e7edc86f581b1345f04c640581eb580390e","8557b21c99f04e85ea92f3d063f61f925a6bca76","bea7d1d6d5c8bb329cbad7d4016f6fdfe3196d48","32c1a2d2a63a2e4e8818fdb287a86ccde31b295b","09f6fa1869be4d3d9188d1313061602038cb97d4","3f4f9efbd2c62ccab0e55dade96489610d640ce3"],"id":"52f9bcb184765de26e71f00c88b4d6ac88017810","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/52f9bcb184765de26e71f00c88b4d6ac88017810","authors":[{"name":"Dhruv Gupta","ids":["39200308"]},{"name":"Klaus Berberich","ids":["1806397"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271745"}

Given a searcher's behavior during a search session, can the searcher's task be predicted? Which aspects of the task can be predicted, and how quickly and how accurately can the prediction be made? Much past literature has examined relationships between browsing behavior and task type at a statistical level, and recent work is moving towards prediction. While one may think whole session measures are useful for prediction, recent findings on common measures have suggested the contrary. Can less of the session still be useful? We examine the opposite end: the first query. Using multiple data sets for comparison, our results suggest that first query measures can be at least as good as -- and sometimes better than -- whole session measures for certain task type predictions.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"How Much is Too Much?: Whole Session vs. First Query Behaviors in Task Type Prediction","journalPages":"1141-1144","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210105"],"entities":["Information retrieval","Session (web analytics)","Statistical model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d7f88f17b5388ad560a1164953feaa440ed0863b","59c56132b8abae36dd0216663cd7ea8b47289dbd","35ec212bb31158054339fdb39484379d75765d70","6379c75c9ee3397ffd3c2ad1be8da3279140349f","1ac14f8d2d6e34cb2a218476fd0f1586e8df8c14","9efdfca1e476541e220d3b8b4f1740c06a5e2663","215fa543bcaa273d41b1c412736b4fc052aabb50","7ef9f22727abc2c78d5d364995fa4ac75c666f9b","6d1eb878e1d2530c197c962dd4a61d2aba015261","7aa38947cff9c25f1301f8bf582aa94944b986b0","50261313142e7c6d07baecace1ca43c55c106fc9","cc5f66225d31cbed75790d196ce5ce76da7f0161","51ce417db8b01e3ee1bc825a96b484de33ee03f3"],"id":"d57c739e73952b93b439a88e215c72637c9078d5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d57c739e73952b93b439a88e215c72637c9078d5","authors":[{"name":"Matthew Mitsui","ids":["2881851"]},{"name":"Jiqun Liu","ids":["2402494"]},{"name":"Chirag Shah","ids":["47362550"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210105"}

Meanwhile, the rich side information affiliated with user-item interactions (e.g., user demographics and item attributes), which provide valuable evidence that why a recommendation is suitable for a user, has not been fully explored in providing explanations. On the technical side, embedding-based methods, such as Wide&Deep and neural factorization machines, provide state-ofthe-art recommendation performance. However, they work like a black-box, for which the reasons underlying a prediction cannot be explicitly presented. On the other hand, tree-based methods like decision trees predict by inferring decision rules from data. While being explainable, they cannot generalize to unseen feature interactions thus fail in collaborative filtering applications. In this work, we propose a novel solution named Tree-enhanced Embedding Method that combines the strengths of embeddingbased and tree-based models. We first employ a tree-based model to learn explicit decision rules (aka. cross features) from the rich side information. We next design an embedding model that can incorporate explicit cross features and generalize to unseen cross features on user ID and item ID. At the core of our embedding method is an easy-to-interpret attention network, making the recommendation process fully transparent and explainable. We conduct experiments on two datasets of tourist attraction and restaurant recommendation, demonstrating the superior performance and explainability of our solution.","inCitations":["fd35d68737cf8fee9b5fa979fc02d9932fbfe608","d5de6f3fb6de20344c145229c3c8d618cc7ea353","e7d11d43489e29f500f34126013ef44b26cacab2","244d0dc5c3fce9576d4895c95bf86a142fbfd835","11e5a445219640a0378ac74fdc9f76e3174a9663","08588a4e596b02f22ac77dc8300aaabc27cb66b4","9cbf32e778128e1e07e309ec644e1654de9fa98b","4e5592a19eab030938b228e934b3dc162f5cc6d9","519da94369c1d87e09c592f239b55cc9486b5b7c","c56de91eae24c8aaaaf6e12efda52fd4b3767a87","434fd8ef8dbb88a33e0d70a90d0ddec2417757a3","e24b485ab356ffa15d749e0f2a1240e1550b9d76","5b05bb1c13f1395d109406c992d9387df8802550","2b971928e1bf079050a9cdabeb9a7d940f5ca3f6","d5dc71aa641a2bb50d20edae277c7fe3ce366718","5737c64e835401694ea801990f7b92eaf4c5f2e4","057ada50135eedd6980de60737af020c0decabd1","303b260d5bef9b5c87c868110ec429fe5ea934ad","1942250b72d2a195db11fbadd9ab7ee6a12027a3","3613f86d0e0424e02d4eabc250735ad73a273a20"],"pmid":"","title":"TEM: Tree-enhanced Embedding Model for Explainable Recommendation","journalPages":"1543-1552","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7a8f/d8670b928b474c4dfeb1dc1898d08d545025.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/slides/www18-tree-embedding-recsys.pdf","http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/www18-tem.pdf","http://www.nextcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/P7-WangXiang.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186066","https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/www18-tem.pdf"],"entities":["Black box","Collaborative filtering","Decision tree","Experiment","Interaction","Personalization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d2941a495900c7b8cc46fcb357c0d2c5d7d086e1","00cbb42367566a70e3c541d93b5873565b9b1288","4cc70dd760c2c8cfc0107921bade45fb5efe860e","39819c758f7eaf6b8c1a333e292934053f7b47c7","1d9b302a5a004e279b984f35d01190cb59658c50","1960c7d4365c1165283fc2304be7d09a853fb33d","1e7d7f76b3a7b494122f40c22487e60a51a2d1be","f7f605a6986014bbebfb8949f811cfd7a784f210","1da8502f88ba3d80917904a029d1086d284fa589","61181e71ca1b899b5fdaaac24daac2463b3e6c96","87da64e1cd7747bfc3d9dc38e4b00bfa0541897c","26bc9195c6343e4d7f434dd65b4ad67efe2be27a","24e2ac56c810f773bd4b2d03e7e9bc1a4519ed7a","2eb32b1a4c5bf741632a9fd5f852253fd0d53def","6800fbe3314be9f638fb075e15b489d1aadb3030","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","05aba481e8a221df5d8775a3bb749001e7f2525e","2375f6d71ce85a9ff457825e192c36045e994bdd","e415d1fc1ec9609dc4895cc4021b15fbc5c8c2e1","013cd20c0eaffb9cab80875a43086e0c3224fe20","5853875ecc400b3b365f73cbf44e8680da2bc5ca","2cbe0ba73d02aabbeefedf841203219796a551b7","bb7519078a45824c711e4ad6317fcfaa3aba3c13","196523c04f9e845cc6dde43f50e40d38909ffafd","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","f0af0029293dc8f242894f113baf15d68228ec4d","0a7f190fc133f75b1add56f62d1102a69565c75b","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","5720a5015ca67400fadd0ff6863519f4b030e731","d3b832f3c4e8b6d81eac24d6e070f756b9e8a7a1","3d1f9a530e710fdd4e2313bda4c8a1f574e60ab6","657fbf29ea0b4904a3e98d1556f9acf38dddae5f","39b4d14b4e8c05afd0e13b7962cf9bf36a7be95e","11e5a445219640a0378ac74fdc9f76e3174a9663","daf9ed5dc6c6bad5367d7fd8561527da30e9b8dd","85c6d5e69de119f4e553b1fbd44508e25e9cfdcf","fc8d2643020c6208cf99778744e07fe01626316c","8aada9eedd752897474815adbc3134ae0f757292","0a5feab178ddb179a37f3a19b69b4a956ed797d8","06b231ed33b173b8fc91aa7fdfc9644f2cb0d60d","1a486c716d3b6f855d89fe293c29bf8b68ae6920","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","582ea307db25c5764e7d2ed82c4846757f4e95d7","705d9e34239e83d41355dc1bb2effc1f66c7b111","bf238bb74eaf26ff5872586d746723d47af2f3ec"],"id":"61781520b20986f2defc7f31eee004d957490e98","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/61781520b20986f2defc7f31eee004d957490e98","authors":[{"name":"Xiuli Wang","ids":["10966012"]},{"name":"Xiangnan He","ids":["7792071"]},{"name":"Fuli Feng","ids":["3440740"]},{"name":"Liqiang Nie","ids":["1743245"]},{"name":"Tat-Seng Chua","ids":["1684968"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186066"}

The HathiTrust Research Center has proposed 'worksets' as a solution for users to conduct their research into the 15 million volumes of HathiTrust content; however existing models of users' information-seeking behaviour, which might otherwise inform workset development, were established before digital library resources existed at such a scale. We examine whether these information-seeking models can sufficiently articulate the emergent user activities of scholarly investigation as perceived during the creation of worksets. We demonstrate that a combination of established models by Bates, Ellis, and Wilson can accommodate many aspects of information seeking in large-scale digital libraries at a broad, conceptual, level. We go on to identify the supplemental information-seeking strategies necessary to specifically describe several workset creation exemplars. Finally, we propose complementary additions to the existing models: we classify strategies as instances of querying, browsing, and contribution. Similarly we introduce a notion of scope according to the interaction of a strategy with content, content-derived metadata, or contextual metadata. Considering the scope and modality of new and existing strategies within the composite model allows us to better express--and so aid our understanding of--information-seeking behaviour within large-scale digital libraries.","inCitations":["0856904aa846b476c2942d981584db18475b79e4","3023cf6184e9cebc7df331bce0102486551e067b"],"pmid":"","title":"Information-Seeking in Large-Scale Digital Libraries: Strategies for Scholarly Workset Creation","journalPages":"1-4","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3200365"],"entities":["Bruce Ellis","Digital library","Emergence","HathiTrust","Information seeking","Library (computing)","Modality (human\u2013computer interaction)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["efa176ea4325d38fd20d505603b4deec038c5fd0","04a52669e95cb0360e4a88ecdd47fe5841b6bb49","874fc50f48fb9f2937621728b9710aeccf611681","00bcf8741a69696c8c981109a135212538f1dbf5","a76c4896592b77a3933e2fde8a8b9a6a4aaa1274","75da8cbabea3af83d88ff660fa67f8dd1cffd0ce","b4c1a39eb1ddd9e251e7982750116f76a80c522e","df6c4fb71d165b771bbc4b82e195da709f9fbe4b","0936fece67ba70cf263dcf8fdef6e2aa77ea1145","9d6c5e9d39136fe586160f3148f630be2e48ce6f"],"id":"04704ac4845e9fb1320c0eebfaf540b2a40a4717","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04704ac4845e9fb1320c0eebfaf540b2a40a4717","authors":[{"name":"David M.

In this paper, we study how to model the influence of events on user queries by framing it as a novel data mining problem. Specifically, given a text description of an event, we mine the search log data to identify queries that are triggered by it and further characterize the temporal trend of influence created by the same event on user queries. We solve this data mining problem by proposing computational measures that quantify the influence of an event on a query to identify triggered queries and then, proposing a novel extension of Hawkes process to model the evolutionary trend of the influence of an event on search queries. Evaluation results using news articles and search log data show that the proposed approach is effective for identification of queries triggered by events reported in news articles and characterization of the influence trend over time, opening up many interesting opportunities of applications such as comparative analysis of influential events and prediction of event-triggered queries by users.","inCitations":["14ad3f3f4e85647bf15e2948bb8ee5e84a63861b"],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling the Influence of Popular Trending Events on User Search Behavior","journalPages":"535-544","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/17a1/0b9fb0d280c40081168e5b229df115f18204.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.yichang-cs.com/yahoo/WWW17_TrendingInfluence.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p535.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054188"],"entities":["Data mining","Framing (World Wide Web)","Qualitative comparative analysis","Web search engine","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["993fbf5bb8e977608c84c9f25f38022220a060b4","c08206b44dd1f0ea54bd073e4effaf2e4483169b","346cd0ff10f9fff5f798c8aa1a9dacd1469b8c9c","23aafca967f1e5fb562f89ece0cb9cd171f69deb","20d8be846239abcff3a817d4aa48cf61aa34724f","8989f67170e8b5213f9c211440963c18efbc7c6a","d2071c1e4a6030dc0005dbfeefdd196a8b293e84","7ef9f22727abc2c78d5d364995fa4ac75c666f9b","85a67d6a15dd98578b69eeb6762cb43cc78695e2","3a1ce6631f46bf5e8b2d835299852d233474d08c","67cb36b7beb91d5e45d11c89c8a0ea21b1bf479e","3c6ee1d5c7c26a5c3c5ce5fb7749d46d75786824","da1bf9b735fa7ec159aa2e922c26ce07f8755fe3","a2bec0c2a8346d36b9b03c7b0d2c8426ed28ff46","42e38615c917116dde670a6f7a10f673bd70b017","6b90a02f0f55d34cf61931602e9955588892b063","7d0ab8168a24df38f7a2e897d1374c4d505979ed","9e463eefadbcd336c69270a299666e4104d50159","4fe25aa22f823eb27e9879342ac1e29026882808","08dcabfd40e5d2e659e5edd71f37949c338a4063","6329874126a4e753f98c40eaa74b666d0f14eaba","0e495ed104d25d03ef6c216fc2aab23f18bb380f","d65984df3b978b02b72203e524f876e886446166","037c6a50a4a7cae1998d944ae2991c986731912a","e3999a46cb8aaf71131a77670da5c5c113aad01d","0e3fbe84b323dac0fdbe6cdebe856bb0e3145d7f","1d8c3e6e6852140f781f7d848f89345c480971d9"],"id":"17a10b9fb0d280c40081168e5b229df115f18204","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/17a10b9fb0d280c40081168e5b229df115f18204","authors":[{"name":"Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu","ids":["2692077"]},{"name":"Liangda Li","ids":["33940122"]},{"name":"Dae Hoon Park","ids":["33749110"]},{"name":"Yi Chang","ids":["1787097"]},{"name":"ChengXiang Zhai","ids":["1736467"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054188"}

Designing and tuning ER algorithms is an error-prone, labor-intensive process, which can significantly benefit from data-driven, automated learning methods. Our focus is on \"big data'' scenarios where the primary challenges include 1) identifying, out of a potentially massive set, a small subset of informative examples to be labeled by the user, 2) using the labeled examples to efficiently learn ER algorithms that achieve both high precision and high recall, and 3) executing the learned algorithm to determine duplicates at scale. Recent work on learning ER algorithms has employed active learning to partially address the above challenges by aiming to learn ER rules in the form of conjunctions of matching predicates, under precision guarantees. While successful in learning a single rule, prior work has been less successful in learning multiple rules that are sufficiently different from each other, thus missing opportunities for improving recall. In this paper, we introduce an active learning system that learns, at scale, multiple rules each having significant coverage of the space of duplicates, thus leading to high recall, in addition to high-precision. We show the superiority of our system on real-world ER scenarios of sizes up to tens of millions of records, over state-of-the-art active learning methods that learn either rules or committees of statistical classifiers for ER, and even over sophisticated methods based on first-order probabilistic models.","inCitations":["aabe9a4aaf9037e8f864a93995f31d1d92716d57","d37c6ada3100697edc328bf1819e4776c1a1f868","96d7cf2cfe6f86d39a83e06a8e9b1ee7479ee46b","097131e143563798078e8c9b7447fb1c77eb34ec","0989ce252514687b638db36d5a3de2888d94bf92"],"pmid":"","title":"Active Learning for Large-Scale Entity Resolution","journalPages":"1379-1388","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132949"],"entities":["Algorithm","Big data","Cognitive dimensions of notations","Erdős\u2013Rényi model","First-order predicate","Information","Notability in the English Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2e56f0eeef02406796905f7258ea54ca52861774","fd676818f8bb2ebecd45daf733992ddb3a075e60","8213dbed4db44e113af3ed17d6dad57471a0c048","3d951e2089ada2546c980158eedd4c635514ae6a","2006309313aefdc5ba3b4b9659b7ff35a084eadd","88cd4becf3587a8378e450a99ded801fbdb264e1","2174a2dc940e16896a2b016ad6b3635cbbbdec23","2ae40898406df0a3732acc54f147c1d377f54e2a","a95903c7c35bd830c1f226b21c6bbbf7c46b5374","83b5d51ab2f0c526dbe640f3b3d9b3b257658dc8","01dfd7b78017ea4059f02081680a9fd4b2bb2a34","20d90871bc0dc7956bf2557d91d8d96deb0a4520","4359e7b1bba1e7a37a591111cd5c719fdb4857c8","513f97b9e489e6d0b46c18ff60703ea8c5520438","c091085afac61f9b7210e24e99e22902e4601b98","d6f2fc0f86a3eb8f683361dc8c964ca8351ebf5f","8c6ce827ed6821f915895506005fdcf6a8c5b707","a2179f9d54a958ceb1e7e428859682b0cd479475","764e168e7ab381bdf71fc7fc9276d383870f3cdb","157852dd14a9b518bf62fa6511be0f02f5d04a79","50d3ecc36357f4df09ed0690f3f42e8e55fec218","151673abe01271dc3fc37725c02e95e7970f3bed","3bbfc62fc13ca27c6e58e42167a6aef593a1365e","648cbab22511017832e71473ec1e5da8a05dfd31","1d8f2b0292f4b6080a5db2470580273757ba4a70","e16333259bb4a688fe2568f0d757299846a3e696","10ae68dea2ce4426eb0d87c99c1094504469752a","02b8e2b9301f83005f0b284fec7ee2468ffc2cba","9b4d9199d96bb41ce2ecbbb73f1a810cb87ebc72","35a2546cc9ad1b3331603d46b1a0c0420b063cf6","1e5a61b40af717e42c136b30ff950c4643d50a81","1d658a63bdef01b713aa0a0be64070c65f7f6aa0","aa0848ac8c287afcbfe0e1de7b5d2b163a13c16c","2a8a3e00b978e4ae12da7fe536b7a5a719c0f0ef","18eed721845dd876c769c1fd2d967c04f3a6eeaa","060bdc422872e375bbef9b1cd82fbf0f936d4691","4b38f5105dbc756ffdbb14519286aa23e5889c1b"],"id":"98a565719d39426e9c47e8a07032498502f9d49a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/98a565719d39426e9c47e8a07032498502f9d49a","authors":[{"name":"Kun Qian","ids":["40464999"]},{"name":"Lucian Popa","ids":["2333727"]},{"name":"Prithviraj Sen","ids":["40655309"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132949"}

To further ameliorate the reformulation process, search engines may provide some query suggestions based on previous queries. In this paper, we propose Reformulation Inference Network (RIN) to learn how users reformulate queries, thereby benefiting context-aware query suggestion. Instead of categorizing reformulations into predefined patterns, we represent queries and reformulations in a homomorphic hidden space through heterogeneous network embedding. To capture the structure of the session context, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with the attention mechanism is employed to encode the search session by reading the homomorphic query and reformulation embeddings. It enables the model to explicitly captures the former reformulation for each query in the search session and directly learn user reformulation behaviors, from which query suggestion may benefit as shown in previous studies. To generate query suggestions, a binary classifier and an RNN-based decoder are introduced as the query discriminator and the query generator. Inspired by the intuition that model accurately predicting the next reformulation can also correctly infer the next intended query, a reformulation inferencer is then designed for inferring the next reformulation in the latent space of homomorphic embeddings. Therefore, both question suggestion and reformulation prediction can be simultaneously optimized by multi-task learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly available AOL search engine logs. The experimental results demonstrate that RIN outperforms competitive baselines across various situations for both discriminative and generative tasks of context-aware query suggestion.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"RIN: Reformulation Inference Network for Context-Aware Query Suggestion","journalPages":"197-206","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271808"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Bayesian network","Binary classification","Categorization","Computation","Computer multitasking","Discriminator","ENCODE","Experiment","Homomorphic encryption","Information needs","Multi-task learning","Network architecture","Random neural network","Recurrent neural network","Relative intensity noise","Session (web analytics)","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","8d182d01a7f75766256f08d60755026557e6d691","a29a2aa3ce86e770f8857824003e3fb055d87990","12460d25f2c9f6f8433d48c3c48740f6dc7082bb","00906ce8f3d422568c08b462a1a2dc79d867947e","4954fa180728932959997a4768411ff9136aac81","6ff05febf5beeb158c654117496a324eb0a6c13e","15781aa355315f5b088fb58a2447ccc426f7b01b","9d7149d9d6de520d62279ecb76cef09b3bccf61e","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","14ac8e70baca654c42369f23590a0bb2601712b5","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","3ca7848a43ea96943ab506f377894b13cf05575b","a538b05ebb01a40323997629e171c91aa28b8e2f","1d68580c9b4829cfadbe72c335a2b9c12c17abc2","14679ca9cf46558c17ceab29acfd808e4890752f","f7ddf4d78943bcb11eb8d08bc6be1e62f806becb","a0a2b72bdcb8476acb1da57a58af068ecc5251ea","0816b20c1a5951e974bbadb921308ef63d804037","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","01f26649377883ec8687082b8cae08ac42c774a0","7ac270230d0b6b55a47d56b7e638f56618b8007b","48480a8d5094b228c37e530a474854deca0c3fe2","a976901c38f702fcc92a52f7cb8836bd20cc70fc","0707acb09adcd2f6946cbd09264414c83918f392","3176797ede1961f31bd92ba0313892f9c67f4d99","581082bf235f70ea070201839d7b8223a0cbf321","27ae5272e7d4c260b1af931c225b5b92cbc7e26d","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","03d648e07baba55bc7376f8174894b606bda7c59","2279b6c32509eeb47184c7fa468cae1e84da24eb","46a3afe1ef550dd29973ac0ce1289162a71642fb","324fc9c732116fa81624faad07524039f193cede","2e42bf8747363161851dc04b85aedb1ada50daaf","cab5fbb2b1c245e1d99542e8ef54e4faf846e3da","362d4eec03067fff5a05dd1a450ac7f5d20fbf2f","da43effe313a12d389a6659f63046d4551e3b815","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2","eef84a6c3cb68a4a3f2a1bb9a0de2e5540c5c32c","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","616f76790ce314ef6c509b486f386b5c4e1e9384","a5839f0e538bcf6538bf0c51812f028da1528855","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","03c5ab0f31220b29d3b8eb60637a7a8140fd87fc","30fd857fc874e587f0c653d5b1853d7fa0d4b490","00f31994c123fbceba5d5a0e06bb78aff651aae7","160ec59f2eb9def5cca00f6c1bf198d13fb8b6a7","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","2472ad58de68c65d54e05470cceee70b4f4f8bb3","213d7af7107fa4921eb0adea82c9f711fd105232","6fb6ac49a9d3a4980c02504c3550ed52726ce61c"],"id":"ff76b79ae2dba7ac8ee2cd9c0324fce03b68bc91","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff76b79ae2dba7ac8ee2cd9c0324fce03b68bc91","authors":[{"name":"Jyun-Yu Jiang","ids":["3165179"]},{"name":"Wei Wang","ids":["47824598"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271808"}

Our detailed analysis of Wikidata\u2019s server-side query logs reveals several important differences to previously studied uses of SPARQL over large knowledge graphs. Wikidata queries tend to be much more complex and varied than queries observed elsewhere. Our analysis is founded on a simple but effective separation of robotic from organic traffic. Whereas the robotic part is highly volatile and seems unpredictable even on larger time scales, the much smaller organic part shows clear trends in individual human usage. We analyse query features, structure, and content to gather further evidence that our approach is essential for obtaining meaningful results here.","inCitations":["b52603ac4d8bfd18128b3d1a9593e9f8744c8040","608f8430a3043cadd62e3ccbb1578067c0c06fc3","e6424d566e4c96aa530c4e18c661a72f83156f46","b28210b2090e021a42bb6e6d1bbbb12e4fce420f"],"pmid":"","title":"Practical Linked Data Access via SPARQL: The Case of Wikidata","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3799/63c6eaebdb79a0f5bf2b483bf348abbe7676.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2073/article-03.pdf","https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/w/images/8/85/Wikidata-SPARQL-queries-Bielefeldt-Gonsior-Kroetzsch-LDOW-2018.pdf","https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/w/images/8/83/Wikidata-SPARQL-analysis-LDOW2018-slides.pdf"],"entities":["Causal filter","Communication endpoint","Cyclic redundancy check","Data access","Download","Information needs","Knowledge Graph","Linked data","Log analysis","Noether's theorem","Robot","SPARQL","Server (computing)","Server-side","Treewidth","User agent","Wikidata","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["52840d8316fd1e7007fb52f206ab6da5cce34bdd","3433d785ac9a6f1ced1706dc4393f8b7dd20809c","96db28d5673e3b3f8b0b643343dd3c48e5f79807","300583e2ecc23410a01d06b2006a78746918672d","26e6bf32fb92eb13249b176bcf3b7b41be11a4a2","20a773041aa5667fbcf5378ac87cad2edbfd28b7","ff73d1e2ae0e8281df7a4ffbfd65efaed99b3157","c05d2bd1529b36e4afd08e0bf625cca282a110b4","5b35981142209ad7d003ec4341b64f9a04005e10","291c92c23f3eaf78dd9dd1cfafc4748f592d4084","78895ae017107d5f0411cc60b13290093cfb996e","7e7d5050da9f370182e15bb68281eae0e0469159","079c3a520f2a102adec40c623a5acf1e6943a5db"],"id":"2e1df954fcb6eeaf0502475f1701d99e27a7c6da","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2e1df954fcb6eeaf0502475f1701d99e27a7c6da","authors":[{"name":"Adrian Bielefeldt","ids":["51363031"]},{"name":"Julius Gonsior","ids":["51378896"]},{"name":"Markus Krötzsch","ids":["2849472"]}],"doi":""}

In this paper, we illustrate different functionalities of FRANKENSTEIN for performing independent QA component execution, QA component prediction, given an input question as well as the static and dynamic composition of different QA pipelines.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Dynamic Composition of Question Answering Pipelines with FRANKENSTEIN","journalPages":"1313-1316","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210175"],"entities":["Executable","Information retrieval","Machine learning","Natural language","Pipeline (computing)","Pipeline (software)","Question answering","Representational state transfer","Requirement","Software framework","Synergy","Usability"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8ae3492af43f1b6ffedb61ac45d81d8ca1f24de7","93646e0d3619b744511ccbb3d37f56dc65598408","2b2c30dfd3968c5d9418bb2c14b2382d3ccc64b2","595f8792ba3239d71850576cb075721a21eb6e94","55f8fa3cf63e59a3d7980f6f4b57a6b55f76d19a","59a497ed01b5234c89da4abb5aab5c30ae22dd26","94a9af119df61f501980cf095700f35c2a7762a3","b37abc1bd49e481d531cf7d91584affa46762885","4d31515773a402820b796bb5c954355b3c25ea8c","2e2eb69405789715ce2a3708e2c149c6e8013afe"],"id":"2cd9393564e0000fad3da55e43959b6e758fbc7d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2cd9393564e0000fad3da55e43959b6e758fbc7d","authors":[{"name":"Kuldeep Singh","ids":["48829341"]},{"name":"Ioanna Lytra","ids":["2115114"]},{"name":"Arun Sethupat Radhakrishna","ids":["41206105"]},{"name":"Akhilesh Vyas","ids":["40914232"]},{"name":"Maria-Esther Vidal","ids":["1684855"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210175"}

The integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very diicult problem. We argue that much of the reason for this is the lack of an adequate indexing model. This suggests that perhaps a better indexing model would help solve the problem. However, we feel that making unwarranted parametric assumptions will not lead to better retrieval performance. Furthermore, making prior assumptions about the similarity of documents is not warranted either. Instead, we propose an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling. We estimate models for each document individually. Our approach to model-ing is non-parametric and integrates document indexing and document retrieval into a single model. One advantage of our approach is that collection statistics which are used heuristically in many other retrieval models are an integral part of our model. We have implemented our model and tested it empirically. Our approach sig-niicantly outperforms standard tf.idf weighting on two diierent collections and query sets.","inCitations":["3ae1b829273071e30696a44946425cfde2ed846c","c6f02cc2ffdd622b89377e107fd18f67c6c81ae1","b256c64063ceea084c09a03774ab9b12f8f0eb49","d2e91d486ae52e4deb7712726141ecd4ada559cd","cf1622ab497a14cb4d7d158b4b5e97c5774d6298","4c4a921000bca38096d748fb671940a13bafd3b5"],"pmid":"","title":"A Language Modeling Approach to Information Retrieval","journalPages":"202-208","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=CBB125943841A4571846D8744571D783?doi=10.1.1.54.6410&rep=rep1&type=pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3130348.3130368","http://cobar.cs.umass.edu/pubfiles/ir-120.ps"],"entities":["Document retrieval","Floor and ceiling functions","Heuristic","Information retrieval","Language model","Mathematical model","Signature block","Tf\u2013idf"],"journalVolume":"51","outCitations":["60a18a583b32306b725530261cc3ba709372ece0","187e7c0462759adb0aaffec1936e3b7ab8d9f4cd","61af1deb7a3016cd0760aca0f0a38a4fecda3d61","ae0067338dff4e6b48b6b798776ec88a6c242aae","78e69dc1739f8ca933721d3e57986a2cb08e7d89","15f0a1ff99250a6823849afe575483ebb11add5f","b7aa2197adb6261b7848b04c343f5dbb15c85fc6","adf663fa6741746cb4b04cb651e077d44a90d683","c4b6d6b936bebb61a77979a4dd029d9cbb632b36","f44e0b5372a4fb1d8e1b15ca9e9cab7b4d65dd94","393d1f3b81410536944dff9514a2b787094e846d","7459b48ba2361bd053bc572eee68f5de442c5e4c"],"id":"33151c9905102c47d431f59fc9a5a7667960507a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/33151c9905102c47d431f59fc9a5a7667960507a","authors":[{"name":"Jay M.

Hyperparameters range from the choice of different system components, e.g., stopword lists, stemming methods, or retrieval models, to model parameters, such as k1 and b in BM25, or the number of query expansion terms. Grid and random search, the dominant methods to search for the optimal system configuration, lack a search strategy that can guide them in the hyperparameter space. This makes them inefficient and ineffective. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian Optimization to jointly search and optimize over the hyperparameter space. Bayesian Optimization, a sequential decision making method, suggests the next most promising configuration to be tested on the basis of the retrieval effectiveness of configurations that have been examined so far. To demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian Optimization we conduct experiments on TREC collections, and show that Bayesian Optimization outperforms manual tuning, grid search and random search, both in terms of retrieval effectiveness of the configuration found, and in terms of efficiency in finding this configuration.","inCitations":["19280525d98a03fef2b92f3002082fff2f6ca7f5","09736f3e7d27cccc0a3a441efb1a4db5f10f6e1c","a8870cfd5665dfd3949dece324e42d09eb82eb16"],"pmid":"","title":"Bayesian Optimization for Optimizing Retrieval Systems","journalPages":"360-368","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159665"],"entities":["Apache Axis","Bayesian optimization","Busy waiting","Conditional (computer programming)","Experiment","Exploit (computer security)","Gaussian process","Global optimization","Hoc (programming language)","Hybrid functional","Information retrieval","Mathematical optimization","Optimizing compiler","Program optimization","Query expansion","Random search","Stemming","Substitution (logic)","Surrogate model","System configuration","Text Retrieval Conference"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["03e3accd5514d4abf5e8d6339051c8aa546e7561","b4ea2ab8448f18e24e6c4789f93f48325470d267","14353a81f125f09d06b150b579fb93fa692150c6","44916f453254b013831abba2ba6ef40d3581d949","19136154f82a0cc1825935e1080fff06ae38d541","4c5cc16b8f890faaa23be30f752fe2a8a935f87f","213225e01a07a8fab60a67e1605186babc328c0c","303eef410700063913f9e6ad349a0830dbccefb8","5fe391303e703b87b672afbaa7d17dc4f4b01ceb","1824f5786dd5990b58933f9c8e73f73fae7c5bcd","60e8994c6f495d5d650b89a123902756963a0b53","e82b360ddbc35c733e043385d7992ead84279a22","305ea2c0992052c4c9574cf1873a855fbb88b957","5ba6dcdbf846abb56bf9c8a060d98875ae70dbc8","47598c6267a065ad0f9226c0a130728fedf18b81","9f2aefc3821853e963beda011ed770f740385b77","2d9a129063497b81950c9067005ecd39be741df1","1001c09821f6910b5b8038a3c5993456ba966946","3ee1ecb2d8d6f2f2cf0343752a71755b37ea9875","df34f9bada6513e668f37619c4d5e89cd12c54b0","0cce1ea72ee3bbb010324a78709845edeb04f669","a31e30ba63f8aae76fe26a5f322771b45c53ff16","57cfb39121b7f772ce9d8f5e4d7a44a4c901a6ff","0e67bac2937f5f53f310564efa547efd82c0371d","6ac7497e941375197034be07842f1dd38c9f95e3","3031ecab2879631618b96f3e4e1e255809a732e9","117d089d8eea767e72d5bb800ba4d6e0e15dad93","ea99602e9f45be76ec135e5df857833ca9677286","889c33e755ac6aad8f58c5847b35b9b4bacdff9c","c7ba20a46ddefed391655e2c60292d1b4382474a","5c211d3bd2234cfc7a88b5c2cec9de052d27f199","3f5e8f884e71310d7d5571bd98e5a049b8175075"],"id":"797ca41dfd813f466c2c25aca580a4dfa25babc9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/797ca41dfd813f466c2c25aca580a4dfa25babc9","authors":[{"name":"Dan Li","ids":["49621181"]},{"name":"Evangelos Kanoulas","ids":["1713134"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159665"}

Many of the features available in this domain are sparse categorical features. This presents a challenge especially when the user responses to be predicted are rare, because each feature will only have very few positive examples. Recently, neural embedding techniques such as word2vec which learn distributed representations of words using occurrence statistics in the corpus have been shown to be effective in many Natural Language Processing tasks. In this paper, we use real-world data set to show that a similar technique can be used to learn distributed representations of features from users web history, and that such representations can be used to improve the accuracy of commonly used models for predicting rare user responses.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Neural Feature Embedding for User Response Prediction in Real-Time Bidding (RTB)","journalPages":"8-13","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c351/c492d119730842e190690da1cdcafe28b579.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00855v3.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00855v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00855","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00855v6.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1840/paper_2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00855v1.pdf"],"entities":["History of the World Wide Web","Natural language processing","Real-time bidding","Real-time transcription","Sparse matrix","Word2vec"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a9472100a5f2f576cfa417aef37e488953b9a63a","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","142f38642629b9d268999ad876af482177d36697","085eac4857ed7b8f3651129376621a58092a3a7e","4954fa180728932959997a4768411ff9136aac81","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","c1c189c7f0b51cca188f41fec22c43295f9d33a1","27cf79ed0e7158ed128db2f4cb0436b36958e5aa","daf9ed5dc6c6bad5367d7fd8561527da30e9b8dd","f18d74ef9d2bd5502f51bb628465b19680cc2642","1be16d8c557b15cdf2db9e7eb4453f2274fd60af","a5056357bf655d962408e38664a992caa00483e8","1bc072002d97808340b312b69427baf2dc9fcb8e","27211ed68a7a00f1df0121fa1890a1b2acdd1a88","7cd260e52018d885eb23618c826b5c44996cdcee"],"id":"208491eb478e89ef154b207a04b45c228362c56d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/208491eb478e89ef154b207a04b45c228362c56d","authors":[{"name":"Enno Shioji","ids":["9553843"]},{"name":"Masayuki Arai","ids":["3045404"]}],"doi":""}

We propose to use Abstract State Machines (ASMs) as the formal basis for dealing with changes in Linked Data, which is the combination of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). We provide a synthesis of ASMs and Linked Data and show how the combination aligns with the relevant specifications such as the Request/Response communication in HTTP, the guidelines for updating resource state in the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification, and the formal grounding of RDF in model theory. Based on the formalisation of Linked Data resources that change state over time, we present the syntax and operational semantics of a small rule-based language to specify user agents that use HTTP to interact with Linked Data as the interface to the environment. We show the feasibility of the approach in an evaluation involving the specification of automation in a Smart Building scenario, where the presented approach serves as a theoretical foundation.","inCitations":["ddf1ca7ea65b18ace86b747949ddf192930a8a7b","3da434135f4f7d20cdb1ec9e059d956f1418d46b"],"pmid":"","title":"Rule-based Programming of User Agents for Linked Data","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e753/450455654cb46ff6fed15dc99e5be4a297d4.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2073/article-05.pdf","http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2018/papers/LDOW2018_paper_7.pdf"],"entities":["Abstract state machines","Autonomous agent","Autonomous robot","Experiment","Hypertext Transfer Protocol","IFTTT","Linked Data Platform","Operational semantics","Request\u2013response","Requirement","Resource Description Framework","Rule-based system","Semantic Web","Turing completeness","User agent"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["21cc08563942116b4930bca91550fee8c26c104e","6431f64556465d264350e5781c47a986b980eb5a","175f67c44e718d2e48470ba488361d811d248cb4","3bf4a5f36a8fbe86d5dd44826a252d910848681a","7b78f3f3c7d8a21d3da1bec0df1d193a9743a59c","a212c0f0880a6f00b2cbffa41be6ae9cb23b70f2","5ab7819ef2d47818d92ed582185e542b22058bd6","5aa28239bbf993d5c3fb6a90c251f1480cd5f20b","45ae05064f3e4816a3664fc9dd46e8577b6e41d8","603b7b2bc6d31e0e6186625f12fb8bcac0e4a54b","6845612d60ff35d338540d181e1d199ded3e8d46","8c5a3fab890520d2f8b620437a3703274778a20d","124126f1f2688a6acff92e6752a3b0cd33dc50b0","0e18dd0f412830d47739daa929cdc83ec23a5bed","8372758c576366556711f96f0eabc3a8babc1481"],"id":"e753450455654cb46ff6fed15dc99e5be4a297d4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e753450455654cb46ff6fed15dc99e5be4a297d4","authors":[{"name":"Tobias Käfer","ids":["1728115"]},{"name":"Andreas Harth","ids":["1775662"]}],"doi":""}

Previous work shows that estimating the effectiveness of feedback documents can substantially affect the PRF performance. Following the recent studies on theoretical analysis of PRF models, in this paper, we introduce a new constraint which states that the documents containing more informative terms for PRF should have higher relevance scores. Furthermore, we provide a general iterative algorithm that can be applied to any PRF model to ensure the satisfaction of the proposed constraint. In this regard, the algorithm computes the feedback weight of terms and the relevance score of feedback documents, simultaneously. To study the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we modify the log-logistic feedback model, a state-of-the-art PRF model, as a case study. Our experiments on three TREC collections demonstrate that the modified log-logistic significantly outperforms competitive baselines, with up to 12% MAP improvement over the original log-logistic model.","inCitations":["324cfb619d94a3bb9857c8df44996d93e41852b3","97347192e6f1853391784d299c2df7edb4f51955","65cdce9211fdc76fe4ef236f8f8bb6ed5459a288"],"pmid":"","title":"Iterative Estimation of Document Relevance Score for Pseudo-Relevance Feedback","journalPages":"676-683","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_65","https://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1254","http://ciir-publications.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1254","http://maroo.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1254"],"entities":["Algorithm","Experiment","Information retrieval","Iterative method","Primitive recursive function","Relevance feedback","Text Retrieval Conference"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c23bedda0dd56d7a9c8198921a49db3979bf00a1","3f37c545a53f806e5df10998c01156c57bba5c28","69ab8fe2bdc2b1ea63d86c7fd64142e5d3ed88ec","511e040ba116ced7517475dd21d7ebd0ac96bf8d","22add44f5c69f266a57b13a20321a1c3b9767e55","158f9e4e385645d2db3949483789cc84ceb41c3c","9b2acd4e8ea6f5fbb68fdcaef4e1c7a11b4e04fb","5b1d4c53be3d58c6d684cfa6df9d792ce8f8898f","05252b795f0f1238ac7e0d7af7fc2372c34a181d","22d1e8ecaf4b42cd761aecbaf736190a6e680470","17a0182ee8d12aa2491a1f4309afe84e6869b2a0","d743b61fbdb8fb6397fd2cec20c261dff9e4a180"],"id":"3c253331f4cf0535c7d517a05c7851b9c7544a4d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3c253331f4cf0535c7d517a05c7851b9c7544a4d","authors":[{"name":"Mozhdeh Ariannezhad","ids":["3429661"]},{"name":"Ali Montazeralghaem","ids":["3375353"]},{"name":"Hamed Zamani","ids":["2499986"]},{"name":"Azadeh Shakery","ids":["2887988"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_65"}

Disease diagnosis due to its sensitive nature, huge costs of error, and complexity has become an increasingly important focus of research in past years. Existing studies model EHR by capturing co-occurrence of clinical events to learn their latent embeddings. However, relations among clinical events carry various semantics and contribute differently to disease diagnosis which gives precedence to a more advanced modeling of heterogeneous data types and relations in EHR data than existing solutions. To address these issues, we represent how high-dimensional EHR data and its rich relationships can be suitably translated into HeteroMed, a heterogeneous information network for robust medical diagnosis. Our modeling approach allows for straightforward handling of missing values and heterogeneity of data. HeteroMed exploits metapaths to capture higher level and semantically important relations contributing to disease diagnosis. Furthermore, it employs a joint embedding framework to tailor clinical event representations to the disease diagnosis goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use Heterogeneous Information Network for modeling clinical data and disease diagnosis. Experimental results of our study show superior performance of HeteroMed compared to prior methods in prediction of exact diagnosis codes and general disease cohorts. Moreover, HeteroMed outperforms baseline models in capturing similarities of clinical events which are examined qualitatively through case studies.","inCitations":["ff87391a060aab3db9cad4c7e5d97b96aa97660c"],"pmid":"","title":"HeteroMed: Heterogeneous Information Network for Medical Diagnosis","journalPages":"763-772","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08052","http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/papers/2018_CIKM_hosseiniA.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08052","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271805","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08052v1.pdf"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7562ca10e3e9fd466be3712830d63996adb74727","b7b9196227cdf2f55bd5b6fac373c9127ccb7b57","a0775fab3b20f2dc0ac2f2626552d046b6afc225","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","69522d612273129b7aad297069b99e3cfacff0ca","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","ccb55be8b363958afea3f0b5a55e600d484638b4","0d1acdc7fef5b8abd61bddd64cf6872e8e9ba197","36e83ef515ef5d6cdb5db827f11bab22155d57a8","b9b89f35b55c7c75114f532dd9350265dfc5baab","13c40b32b9f35c8d24a5c00ec16a88382aaf07fe","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","2848b45e35e5c1fe8c90cfd2dbb58798795b5fb7","bf9b8bf6d7eff34f0d458f117c24d0f751f8cc2a","7596dca67c1e51079291166ef9d0b769d392536c","a70e02b6e42b908cdbc53bc6cecb532cf72d4d4a","63936fa32f9e75ab2a864daae6791ce02112183d","982f0ec9c7cec5b0dcf48790b179ac3bff0afde5","83a6cacc126d85c45605797406262677c256a6af","27a06d514adb82fe94873b3ade254757a94ae620","ac3c183f99b4646b173651491ab99238d49f435a","09f333582b11b0ee0d9320b1be5c5849a0a689f3","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","84cb5c782a6ef18113a3b64f0451717322dc02f0","348647b4f6332bb53732f9574cb169cbb424b8fd","a3d86c97ffc750dc98ad6717cbc63979926e97a2","29924ac96454c070e6c5f920c52399e2486b7d27","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","b45301e22fcbf64d18de8390c4ba9995269e2807","5abf1c0ff7dc9157aedd9dfa021f8d3dcc647d9b","1be16d8c557b15cdf2db9e7eb4453f2274fd60af"],"id":"a9474a0947a0fee13e43ca95b53ecbf245270c52","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a9474a0947a0fee13e43ca95b53ecbf245270c52","authors":[{"name":"Anahita Hosseini","ids":["40209311"]},{"name":"Ting Chen","ids":["48129107"]},{"name":"Wenjun Wu","ids":["40072752"]},{"name":"Yizhou Sun","ids":["1792614"]},{"name":"Majid Sarrafzadeh","ids":["1684837"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271805"}

Most previous work assumes that documents closely linked with each other share common topics. However, the associations among documents are usually complex, which are not limited to the homophily (i.e., tendency to link to similar others). Actually, the heterophily (i.e., tendency to link to different others) is another pervasive phenomenon in social networks. In this paper, we introduce a new tool, called copula, to separately model the documents and links, so that different copula functions can be applied to capture different correlation patterns. In statistics, a copula is a powerful framework for explicitly modeling the dependence of random variables by separating the marginals and their correlations. Though widely used in Economics, copulas have not been paid enough attention to by researchers in machine learning field. Besides, to further capture the potential associations among the unconnected documents, we apply the tree-averaged copula instead of a single copula function. This improvement makes our model achieve better expressive power, and also more elegant in algebra. We derive efficient EM algorithms to estimate the model parameters, and evaluate the performance of our model on three different datasets. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant improvements on both topic and link modeling compared with the current state of the art.","inCitations":["17f1e4c6614bf324a32fbebbbb724f92511f9be8","c9ca279518ba112c516a1db4e8012965d2e43e3f","ef6450a791ebf795f1cc376f5eba194ef57f5cff","d8e32ae04f7f0b40683f81f842d69bc08a785a0f","736e8deabcae7e2f9eb6c41a1bfae1b5270a8dbd","a5160db2d31d47545fb68a4a17580969e1e02f80","d634fb6ef9d56e2828fc3a2d9e4a01bf3f5d660a","490d62a26f3363d3c135c18c6eea02ce9d80dc53"],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling Document Networks with Tree-Averaged Copula Regularization","journalPages":"691-699","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018666"],"entities":["Algorithm","Expressive power (computer science)","Machine learning","Pervasive informatics","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["62156cbd90f1146b249319ebb4f5ca454841fba4","319764d09e38c9bb3508ca57fe8173ba46e271b3","d634fb6ef9d56e2828fc3a2d9e4a01bf3f5d660a","1912e09b3c88ff6d2f37a081623b01e7224c1735","ce5b8c0aeef599d8c87ab5250d602e935f50bd87","599d261cd0d2cfed15332ad9b061134a69ac69bd","62bb7ce6ae6ed38f0ae4d304d56e8edfba1870d0","0c158a3fcccc3b330f401658e516ac804878c2c2","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","215aa495b4c860a1e6d87f2c36f34da464376cc4","30dc2c8109dabdf291631b08eeea25abf95fcbd7","2082c19e8279fbd08e5193d2291b69020e5cac8b","907c7361bd51cced9ef38a3ad5fc21ecfb5726cd","c442903cb6114af678428fe55873276cd62387cb","eab2148de7917eb572bcbb685e3604f3ce4e132f","15973b0bfdbe84d1cb6e2a35fc857a1d125a3923","8bf730243ed967afd5349bef053641a6043517a0","17ad7d385564833f682db11240ea3d74a5423256","970d19f9fc38615497803b0e6942c5ab20e76d3e","0f6f071d87a7c3e8e2fa179954186777b045bd21","5573d6b9a2c0f1dcb6f1969e629affa27e3d92e8","280c4cdea3356be5340ac0082a031137e88fd168","1e7091d3300e5e90b9f5390a5585ba5948871586","2b747165bc855ac413c4e0e91d09fa60b74e12dd","3dd5b127b18fd1e7e36b2d8b4c97b06f9bf38999","29f3a031cfdcb44f3b19b8458adffd28ff1b2a9a","f2f66d2e570ea8e14b48dd7eebb706854407883a","c1cc15b2c5d8a98e49d0fa3d0240d5791ccce564","8e3c095d493a6e6780ac6d947e09eab8ad8f1969","2eef425070956720cfa1b0eb21f7443aaf33c200","37ade5da89ad0823169995f4109eac79f92f730f","59cce25151fe4d70383624dd535f533617dd8025"],"id":"ac60fb937b13c6764c7e7297ef209552ff4b5b6f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ac60fb937b13c6764c7e7297ef209552ff4b5b6f","authors":[{"name":"Yuan He","ids":["38639681"]},{"name":"Cheng Wang","ids":["40614800"]},{"name":"Changjun Jiang","ids":["39033094"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018666"}

Recent advances that perform clustering into learned deep features (such as DEC[14], IDEC [6] or VaDe [10]) have shown improvements over classical algorithms, but most of them are based on the Euclidean distance. Moreover, symmetry-based distances have shown to be a powerful tool to distinguish symmetric shapes -- such as circles, ellipses, squares, etc. This paper presents an adaptation of symmetry-based distances into deep clustering algorithms, named SymDEC.

Diversifying these results is often accomplished with heuristics, which are impoverished models of users' desire for diversity. However, integrating more complex statistical models of diversity into large-scale, mature systems is challenging. Without a good match between the model's definition of diversity and users' perception of diversity, the model can easily degrade users' perception of the recommendations. In this work we present a statistical model of diversity based on determinantal point processes (DPPs). We train this model from examples of user preferences with a simple procedure that can be integrated into large and complex production systems relatively easily. We use an approximate inference algorithm to serve the model at scale, and empirical results on live YouTube homepage traffic show that this model, coupled with a re-ranking algorithm, yields substantial short- and long-term increases in user engagement.","inCitations":["7b1d5d25a3271b82af300ec4a9381e9379d434c4"],"pmid":"","title":"Practical Diversified Recommendations on YouTube with Determinantal Point Processes","journalPages":"2165-2173","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272018"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Digital Photo Professional (DPP)","Diversification (finance)","Heuristic (computer science)","Information retrieval","Interaction","Kernel (operating system)","Kernel panic","Mathematical optimization","Personalization","Recommender system","Reinforcement learning","Statistical model","User (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["308e6dbbc4436e96453110897b97a9ae79b413a6","760948698540118031e590fbc884fcea209f9104","c669c8cb28c6d219419e0e904a795164e8c6be05","e84e9f82f49eb5a21cdf2306e42478773ff9e82a","551e295794915ac7db0d35fcb6d9792b04f92d59","06eb3905e63c3e3bbd862a38b9773211390d3581","64693b8c3b3340a4055e336b9a2be0d81b80c064","c0c4ed2c7ee77483e8ae9d7db2d4ce2c273781f8","a52ecc6e1438eaa2b05c65efc41e3949042fa2e8","8990b69a7950fdbf36ff8634ccd2b189b00ffdd0","5c3785bc4dc07d7e77deef7e90973bdeeea760a5","517a461a8839733e34c9025154de3d6275543642","a25eeff91f60e7e3f4ca5bc2e8a4c693b76c7f3c","ea938f2675beb27460d9706b4bad51f73c2c3f49","043a50d17d2f9a3c9f4af154afdb19a178364867","41aa0d322183087e2b467a40f07658a7c92565c4","36cb4ed29f9f0b6ea37343b3d98154293a374ec2","10486f0102297696f51da9f8f7c4ded4c0c49fb3","2f88b24d8b2cde4575dc38c229169ce921aa01d8","28592229e9e3fe69d18c260b279c2309d1276863","36643014498ef721e28dc4efd9703544b58b845a","0cce36b389167c4aa2f310c1c0714c67ce0f621f","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","a72f412d336d69a82424cb7d610bb1bb9d81ef7c","5a19267b8fdf02e7523a07508f2be693159da1a2","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","047d078f6cfed4cc067643b5e15f4e8f65a97c0b","10205ce087b9190ac18ade8be02a660d92a6ea52","4f207372bc0d99bade54d5a97d814b249e4bebf0","ded1fa5432e066c3a9f998bd52c6ed736068c582","64edd2c5c41e856695e1dcb950c0512c3a87edec","24f896e584033e5aa9a20327e25de1f387c3f430","8f00aa80f549b36101f524bf921e2964b7299975","35508a476f2be93bd5a43427d414abbc2785ac9c","9103b7efcb53c5774d20f079f604c699088c6814","206f4fa5e37152a0bf313755cb0e0eced7c99724","26ec0b0a8fae543e19c8bb8cad8fe279a70df89f","0f39c8437226fc920716b5399ffcd55e28401186","92241479432603a6f4e96e7e997b2e9c1b0e7794","b9e43395663f74c581982e9ca97a0d7057a0008c","15004aadabd967ac722a28a9c3bb39cf5bc32605","9559c03c64317c48f30e80563241ce1a0285bbd0","4cd62065b0acbb42cffcac3dfd123baec2192470"],"id":"f5e4826a70dbee171db79368658b834db9fec878","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f5e4826a70dbee171db79368658b834db9fec878","authors":[{"name":"Mark P.

While most previous work focuses on factoid question-answering, we focus on the non-factoid question-answering. Unlike factoid CQA, non-factoid question-answering usually requires passages as answers. The shortness, sparsity and diversity of answers form interesting challenges for summarization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sparse coding-based summarization strategy that includes three core ingredients: short document expansion, sentence vectorization, and a sparse-coding optimization framework. Specifically, we extend each answer in a question-answering thread to a more comprehensive representation via entity linking and sentence ranking strategies. From answers extended in this manner, each sentence is represented as a feature vector trained from a short text convolutional neural network model. We then use these sentence representations to estimate the saliency of candidate sentences via a sparse-coding framework that jointly considers candidate sentences and Wikipedia sentences as reconstruction items. Given the saliency vectors for all candidate sentences, we extract sentences to generate an answer summary based on a maximal marginal relevance algorithm. Experimental results on a benchmark data collection confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method in answer summarization of non-factoid CQA, and moreover, its significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of ROUGE metrics.","inCitations":["4e5592a19eab030938b228e934b3dc162f5cc6d9","a483c62f661f57a883c06daa6ac25b7f80cad661","238e2e584192e7ad40be997ba2252323ae09673e","c41d71217cebb1ef70ba16068d21df9f7be16b70","3a94167d2cc39282d55cade641ec887e9eaf6b01","0477823fd5536e11e37638a46d4212de145eb3da","52434734f75a0a238f3e62552ec414e8b5bb8034"],"pmid":"","title":"Summarizing Answers in Non-Factoid Community Question-Answering","journalPages":"405-414","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018704","https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/song-summarizing-2017.pdf","http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse291-b/reading/p405-song.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Automatic vectorization","Benchmark (computing)","Convolutional neural network","Entity linking","Feature vector","Genetic algorithm","Marginal model","Mathematical optimization","Maximal set","Network model","Neural coding","Question answering","Relevance","Sparse matrix","Wikipedia","Yahoo!

Most of the tags in these narrow folksonomies were created by users when they published a post, but some tags were retroactively created for old posts by a small group of volunteers. Both organic and retroactive tags on MetaFilter and Ask MetaFilter followed a power law distribution, which is expected for folksonomies. Based on tag distribution, use of organization tags, and avoidance of synonyms, however, retroactive taggers did not tag like professional indexers. Instead, they tagged using similar practices to organic taggers, even actively accommodating the broader community's use of synonyms. These findings suggest that folksonomies remain a distinctly different approach to knowledge organization.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Social Tagging: Organic and Retroactive Folksonomies","journalPages":"179-182","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3197026.3197065"],"entities":["Blog","Comparison of Q&A sites","Folksonomy","Knowledge organization","MetaFilter"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["fbadf283bdfeb39a701927d83c58f2bea7fd40d7","6cf79990e9914eccf79fb15e487c03483faa5d9e","ace403a63cbea659f1ab8747e118960c73978e1b","b9488095c12d36d5568f443b9b4d28e57d55b028","7530460fc0c625e9fcded046fb486d2b4cd6ce8e","aa11849871fe719f02c75051c2ff0f9bd3134de1","d9a9dad2dfd3c5980b2783f863ed0a8d5dcd306b","82a3d0c52dda8a7f9f00e5b30c2f9d6ce3da6030","5f40190982c3fa2d61407a8d8364e83ca2663f22"],"id":"c8b4e9f21dedc39f96a0a3528f67db3ba79790dd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c8b4e9f21dedc39f96a0a3528f67db3ba79790dd","authors":[{"name":"Chris Holstrom","ids":["46223916"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3197026.3197065"}

Although traditionally news was curated solely by human editors, increasing news volume has led media outlets to adopt editorial algorithms. However, such algorithms are often proprietary, and smaller outlets do not have the resources to build them from scratch. In this paper, we present a novel framework \u2018Samar\u2019 to automatically curate news by optimizing recency, relevance and diversity of the selected stories. Evaluations over two real-world news datasets show that Samar outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in matching the news curation performed by human editors.

In this paper, we explore deep learning techniques for answering multi-step reasoning questions that operate on semi-structured tables. Challenges here arise from the level of logical compositionality expressed by questions, as well as the domain openness. Our approach is weakly supervised, trained on question-answer-table triples without requiring intermediate strong supervision. It performs two phases: first, machine understandable logical forms (programs) are generated from natural language questions following the work of [Pasupat and Liang, 2015]. Second, paraphrases of logical forms and questions are embedded in a jointly learned vector space using word and character convolutional neural networks. A neural scoring function is further used to rank and retrieve the most probable logical form (interpretation) of a question. Our best single model achieves 34.8% accuracy on the WikiTableQuestions dataset, while the best ensemble of our models pushes the state-of-the-art score on this task to 38.7%, thus slightly surpassing both the engineered feature scoring baseline, as well as the Neural Programmer model of [Neelakantan et al., 2016].","inCitations":["09b94316daac1bb88e9a052aa2f8f662c1c6c469","2577a45aa0fd4677a2468e8865ae3f09c49bfd68","acc80763d7d9482e0ba67330380ff8ee721835dd","d202d6323f39b3367d305ecf4c8f6afef675b1ba","4e6dc15cbcf9b175a8e294dd51ec7c6fe82020b3","ca25815b6fd7ce8f18ad3f371f3e2b4546b724a2","104b48a749d5aa22b6689ba7bfd71964fdd9728a","a5395b641876f1fb8a57e9650a5f11cb82e61e86","b08c35f8e529f47a3fdc4f0713ffe77d94c57d87","8c6f58ed0ebf379858c0bbe02c53ee51b3eb398a","afdee392c887aae5fc529c815ec88cabaeba6bcf"],"pmid":"","title":"Neural Multi-Step Reasoning for Question Answering on Semi-Structured Tables","journalPages":"611-617","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3b7f/3767915b13a16032fe347a71372e6df71066.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06589v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_52","http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06589","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06589v2.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Convolutional neural network","Deep learning","Embedded system","End-to-end principle","Experiment","Interpretation (logic)","Natural language processing","Openness","Programmer","Question answering","Scoring functions for docking","Semiconductor industry","Supervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5c3785bc4dc07d7e77deef7e90973bdeeea760a5","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","1ef01e7bfab2041bc0c0a56a57906964df9fc985","ce9514fa703406fd13c2d504d81f1e37560ed924","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","478b4a5123bd5fda98bb35e6317d7f3555fec97d","151c202a0fbbf3373514514ca207f55e1a5605c3","a584211768d49f80192f13b8ed2fda9c058dec34","0730efeacf9bfd6d65ca6c2fa659b396f48d5659","96232dd74fad21f495a2f4563fd42869d968e6bf","5a829f63a9a03be652ed8568ab6ce77ef0f2a712","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","4ea57f15a87052237c4231db05d5a88ecf176695","e66aa11fb364871417715a9eb161e9d538470415","33261d252218007147a71e40f8367ed152fa2fe0","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","3adf41984ca96649adedc1fa4d3c69cc8404d00f","0b8759d61e93b809df16d9fe9010d2a2d7241c74","41ab97376fcbd67d05bad648b40d92d96a3f1c1c","033eb044ef6a865a53878397633876827b7a8f20"],"id":"3b7f3767915b13a16032fe347a71372e6df71066","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b7f3767915b13a16032fe347a71372e6df71066","authors":[{"name":"Till Haug","ids":["30823991"]},{"name":"Octavian-Eugen Ganea","ids":["1882451"]},{"name":"Paulina Grnarova","ids":["3332510"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_52"}

Yet, apart from the search engine companies themselves, little is known about how their algorithms filter, rank, and present the web to users. This question is especially pertinent with respect to political queries, given growing concerns about filter bubbles, and the recent finding that bias or favoritism in search rankings can influence voting behavior. In this study, we conduct a targeted algorithm audit of Google Search using a dynamic set of political queries. We designed a Chrome extension to survey participants and collect the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and autocomplete suggestions that they would have been exposed to while searching our set of political queries during the month after Donald Trump\u2019s Presidential inauguration. Using this data, we found significant differences in the composition and personalization of politically-related SERPs by query type, subjects\u2019 characteristics, and date.","inCitations":["7fff84ad83b10f65b0d0d1f0eaccb4654b58a65c"],"pmid":"","title":"Auditing the Personalization and Composition of Politically-Related Search Engine Results Pages","journalPages":"955-965","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad84/3bca7de3bf56e9e06128319ceb84a770cda6.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://cbw.sh/static/pdf/robertson-www18.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186143"],"entities":["Algorithm","Google Search","Personalization","Relevance","Search engine results page","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4e7293f86ad3c97efcdc8cbc8366bbee1907bb6d","97cb66c583b50a95703c742bb213f270b2d0c549","0b124b4ed7c77ee71a7be161cf0a57dbf25aacfb","049eb75c64d8b80b62d6227a6b628e8bdef0e216","380b9a338de3907c7ff36aeeac7391736e4f368c","2ae42f1b7bb14bcb452cad93f487515d90ccbae8","a62cc06e6c2f484ddf8d8800ae34aecba5bddd07","651b7744bebfeb6c6e42aa6b6d566e507fe319a5","50b06fbedf13a36003be94ef9dcb5236ed07cf51","b7227cbd34766655dea10d0437ab10df3a127396","534c0ab8b234aed946e75f8bcdefa174f54c40ae","852388dff9f597c88af2248469320bd31df6702e","74cd4462cfeef550751955ac45214cee9fd8e3e9","5b49e7e564c40e0e1bb3254a5386744c3de056ca","f0cb77ee29a326abf077c8df225a41ea891417b5","471cb4c2e5039bdaacb0274fee70c7fe2e93493e","405bcccf138241723be802b28d7c6c708345f9c9","f63a51d0a4ad2365ffa80f45e2f08c36b33e294d","9fa333b0af352ffe36bcb1e10381d1724ea5b35b","0a73df5bb7b66e92dfae8c3c65373b30680aaf16","e7be1e5874bb0fa26a85361b52c0aa10489fc99d","195129ed33630f07423dddd8d5b1b73b3431cd18","4cbcbd413226697f95efc36be1bb793396ab3529","e23b0a41c22e21b1a6632f0c54768c445a18a870","1ce5d98c66071d997baf969206ad7521de346299","cf32d610202300ce228eb6a5a0149ea66af1fac2","81a809b9b5ac940778fe2c7c9fe6df262fec927a","f51820619ca42c5799f3c5acc3855671b905419c","c8665198592b52ba122e5cf84032a9bc1c61eade","050f2c5ecdd39d261582b3e4aec8cf13c5d14ed0","617839ce22706600d2934670ea3f5be2b414f7be","14b12181c378b851fe24251ca4e99ee414e2b137","42004b6bdf5ea375dfaeb96c1fd6f8f77d908d65","011634ac44a03136456b9c2003ea6b655b284543","21428d84cc75ab67c5497d0dbc3a7711adc3aac6","3a9ca54ab9eec236cfbe8537c15b1b43175ccf56","0cb48d8068e5a561c03a070e6de2edc39e4a5437","290d0c06caf253af1e72361caacc43383e4f6c1c","1d89a12092d6323b9d3b1a5bd4e6790897e2a2be","9084a72fb1617e1c4a2b78d204b157b422aaabd6","fd8b29c110600eab1e18900d0505589c92970a98","154e504956cbbc8ddfd2e0aa420333f81f1183c9","2bbf6baccda2c763ad04e6c88e0b37c8c2cf85bb"],"id":"ad843bca7de3bf56e9e06128319ceb84a770cda6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ad843bca7de3bf56e9e06128319ceb84a770cda6","authors":[{"name":"Ronald E.

Traditionally, entity linking and relation linking have been performed either as dependent sequential tasks or as independent parallel tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework called EARL, which performs entity linking and relation linking as a joint task. EARL implements two different solution strategies for which we provide a comparative analysis in this paper: The first strategy is a formalisation of the joint entity and relation linking tasks as an instance of the Generalised Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP). In order to be computationally feasible, we employ approximate GTSP solvers. The second strategy uses machine learning in order to exploit the connection density between nodes in the knowledge graph. It relies on three base features and re-ranking steps in order to predict entities and relations. We compare the strategies and evaluate them on a dataset with 5000 questions. Both strategies significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art approaches for entity and relation linking.","inCitations":["26f13551b912049a3dedcb00fe819211fcb78eda"],"pmid":"","title":"EARL: Joint Entity and Relation Linking for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs","journalPages":"108-126","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e5c3/15f39cca71cf99368d40f78e8d7cba4085f9.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03825","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_7","http://jens-lehmann.org/files/2018/iswc_earl.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03825","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03825v4.pdf"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["fb6fdc8874812f691ed7f1dca168e72304aeb1e5","1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002","54ef300d6ca9d02fd6dc5e96b867f626189199c8","a967f69696220b7d51f7e5c2a87fe011ad646283","445c8907f09c649da1c0e70f26d15d44667b5152","595f8792ba3239d71850576cb075721a21eb6e94","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","844d502387a3996f167b04e2e83117c30c22e752","4bd4eae119925d6e690741ee0c42f1fb5a1e79bd","8e32e1f02b7060ce419a964b800d0927a2e1d69c","1d2a4018b4fc6a5f498e65d68260615dbc9e7ec6","77cd8f90d727947c27d0ab2c8d4175b36d382fdf","9ca61f6ede25100da67b5388c941bf69929a7528","8573283039fd2dd9712ec652c9db939ea109a754","042db0977555fcd7d5eac67b26695cd918ecb44c","914cfd6fb61d75608592164193f90776bef58a7e","f23ff51b33ca08ea68dfb43048c42242e7fe2b0d","786096c13fa61e72869744be057cae3db0179737","9e163940219265fc4595bb3c66f7a35f83b2943f","b52c1b64ba302460aad5dbb2e0ba239be55f5e38","c21944eb1655f46da1825220a318dfbf2eb812b0","1d7d7362c1e4b1544fd4ce2af7c65f9f47ffeb82","b0f87df4d03a12635c26be042deafee5298ce815","d37e7325be2f7492dac2002d535401711a955faf","b37abc1bd49e481d531cf7d91584affa46762885","ad40e2f53f7112f4d2177df99fe5df47e2028541","1e14be498f5a5618d671375b59e19c00bb67125e","d3d84bf72e0b8c1e678faefe8d6b54837eb33fb9","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","ef2281819cc92401e8488ca735794b2f46e319d0","67bee729d046662c6ebd9d3d695823c9d820343a","b162c99873c929447bb7ff48d454867aa83f375c"],"id":"e5c315f39cca71cf99368d40f78e8d7cba4085f9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e5c315f39cca71cf99368d40f78e8d7cba4085f9","authors":[{"name":"Mohnish Dubey","ids":["3403690"]},{"name":"Debayan Banerjee","ids":["35635012"]},{"name":"Debanjan Chaudhuri","ids":["35464282"]},{"name":"Jens Lehmann","ids":["2841524"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_7"}

The Research Graph database contains a largescale graph that links research datasets (i.e., data used to support research) to funding records (i.e. grants), publications and researcher records such as ORCID profiles. This database was derived from the work of the Research Data Alliance Working Group on Data Description Registry Interoperability (DDRI), and curated using the Research Data Switchboard open source software. By being available in Linked Data format, the Research Graph database is more accessible to third-party web services over the Internet, which thus opens the opportunity to connect to the rest of the world in the semantic format. The primary purpose of this pilot project is to evaluate the feasibility of converting registry objects in Research Graph to JSON-LD by accessing widely used vocabularies published at Schema.org. In this paper, we provide examples of publications, datasets and grants from international research institutions such as CERN INSPIREHEP, National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in Australia, and Australian Research Council (ARC). Furthermore, we show how these Research Graph records are made semantically available as Linked Data through using Schema.org.

Unfortunately, users have misconceptions about what this mode does. Many factors likely contribute to these misconceptions. In this paper, we focus on browsers\u2019 disclosures, or their inbrowser explanations of private browsingmode. In a 460-participant online study, each participant saw one of 13 different disclosures (the desktop and mobile disclosures of six popular browsers, plus a control). Based on the disclosure they saw, participants answered questions about what would happen in twenty browsing scenarios capturing previously documented misconceptions. We found that browsers\u2019 disclosures fail to correct the majority of the misconceptions we tested. These misconceptions included beliefs that private browsing mode would prevent geolocation, advertisements, viruses, and tracking by both the websites visited and the network provider. Furthermore, participants who saw certain disclosures were more likely to have misconceptions about private browsing\u2019s impact on targeted advertising, the persistence of lists of downloaded files, and tracking by ISPs, employers, and governments.","inCitations":["c9435c2d3dbebc22f0aa893543d6c53819c2ade3","8083bfa7beda8996d92a2c68ed627a0202df9c01","52366d2a97664f54e4d58b8c7e3642934bf60cc0"],"pmid":"","title":"Your Secrets Are Safe: How Browsers' Explanations Impact Misconceptions About Private Browsing Mode","journalPages":"217-226","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ce34/3e89b0fdd81c8f6479c4c4577f24e011453f.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://www.blaseur.com/papers/privatebrowsing.pdf","https://www.blaseur.com/papers/www18privatebrowsing.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186088"],"entities":["Browsing","Computer virus","Desktop computer","Features of the Opera web browser","Geolocation","HTTP cookie","Persistence (computer science)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0af6b0455f159fdd5944102a50285910f06c32eb","b0d12aafe2bcf636f19f0c3c48b3de865dabc268","30124224a8cd2b8aea3c1361a972b865eec20a6f","1006c70eff5b3967030635c800c3ad9c0494b7c3","b15633ac0fc71f85a011e9dab37d6b3dbed87317","8cfecf258430c4b736e15ee3eed7e7955837583e","1b6efd54d9ef5b1cb3d8d8959c9d76ef3363ed49","03667897fd22a31eb96232e14b7e08e26a5b9ad7","863841d07ed0d31579b39c8ac0a1f7b088368ba4","30da81303f7f08a4c8a86bdc2c5902ea8ffeacc4","3f770cc7662340485f8fb328b3f2c95403a08e8d","99e3ccfe401d65c8a4c177b3160eeb8e3e5a01b3","d8cc44f872bc18aad25415ea2209da1caf6560d2","0fd652356d1ecbc457504a17f594187ccab2fe76","791624a78324cfde9247ede7e217bd4e01d72a3f","386abd3bc7eea3cc292906a52acc78307f2f98a2","2fef02e050e62849fb450d46c90541d9588dea8e","76addf1348e661cfc5802be376bdd5b66eabbb8a","9a3c791067911d17a79918b1b0b5826beaeb2fe1","3c05cbe63aec1b566a3c5f39dca938ffc28cc842","bf3416ea02ea0d9327a7886136d7d7d5a66cf491","89341c38503c6cab643c5d5a019a5454e6e39f97","c35ece950e2642480b5ca008912b3e5b6b71c9f1","144f8d725ac6f9019caa67d2fe4f894185bf513b","a41762f34955a57710a2582653f883cb14795b29","918472392d231490665a62605d8842579eaf06b6"],"id":"4ec45491dfe5ddf4a0c48efe201fc54876843d52","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4ec45491dfe5ddf4a0c48efe201fc54876843d52","authors":[{"name":"Yuxi Wu","ids":["4692558"]},{"name":"Panya Gupta","ids":["40913280"]},{"name":"Miranda Wei","ids":["40917180"]},{"name":"Yasemin Acar","ids":["3224778"]},{"name":"Sascha Fahl","ids":["2200198"]},{"name":"Blase Ur","ids":["2222651"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186088"}

These tools often produce weighted rules and facts that make up a probabilistic KB (PKB). In such a PKB, probabilistic inference is used in order to perform marginal inference, consistency checking and other tasks. However, in general, inference is known to be intractable. Hence, recently, there are a number of studies aimed at lifting (making tractable or approximating) inference by exploiting symmetries in the structure of a PKB. These studies alleviate grounding entirely a given PKB which can generate a sizable factor graph for inference (e.g. to compute the probability of a query). In line with this, we propose a novel technique to automatically partition rules based on their structure for efficient parallel grounding. In addition, we perform query expansion so as to generate a factor graph small enough to be used for efficient probability computation. We present a novel approximate marginal inference algorithm that uses N-hop subgraph extraction and query expansion. Moreover, we show that our system is much faster than state-of-the-art systems.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Towards Partition-Aware Lifted Inference","journalPages":"1823-1826","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269327"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Cobham's thesis","Computation","Computational complexity theory","Experiment","Factor graph","Knowledge base","Lambda lifting","Machine learning","Marginal model","Microsoft Outlook for Mac","Query expansion"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b654672cf303e06ca86f178aa67748710bdd443e","ae69852fd9fedb9e0a56866cbbf9d30bef8300a3","c2f5fbb4f657462091895c294ee6f107e1a55669","2d03baec8ac1568e6813aa43d625d552524f977e","badfdeba7420a7fae248ceee132d8aa7de812405"],"id":"19c9471462637b870e191ac7578cd7972a4533fc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/19c9471462637b870e191ac7578cd7972a4533fc","authors":[{"name":"Melisachew Wudage Chekol","ids":["2077657"]},{"name":"Heiner Stuckenschmidt","ids":["1698459"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269327"}

To reduce the cost of retaining such data, compression tools are often applied. But simply seeking the best compression ratio is not necessarily the most economical choice, and other factors also come in to play, including compression and decompression throughput, the main memory required to support a given level of on-going access to the stored data, and the types of storage available. Here we develop a model for the total retention cost (TRC) of a data archiving regime, and by applying the charging rates associated with a cloud computing provider, are able to derive dollar amounts for a range of compression options, and hence guide the development of new approaches that are more cost-effective than current mechanisms. In particular, we describe an enhancement to the Relative Lempel Ziv (RLZ) compression scheme, and show that in terms of TRC, it outperforms previous approaches in terms of providing economical long-term data retention.","inCitations":["52f5aa276a64ae4b4e9ee840622c38ced40fc4d0"],"pmid":"","title":"A Cost Model for Long-Term Compressed Data Retention","journalPages":"241-249","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018738"],"entities":["Adaptive compression","Analysis of algorithms","Archive","Cloud computing","Computer data storage","Data compression","Dictionary","Google Chrome","Knowledge base","Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Stac","Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch","Requirement","Research data archiving","Throughput"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["02cbb22e2011938d8d2c0a42b175e96d59bb377f","dac7a688f60d1cd470a6e81fbe4dc5a08e341a0d","8d94832e245906775b428e949ac1f635bfb28ad3","1201f09aeda7c3bd825cc6be1097411c8c1f8a96","f963cfbfc6f4e419eff21c434f2467e213059c2d","017d39fc2267bca437bb652266aad70c02ca4a5a","98fb90c0a71dd1c8ad5979d910d30bc9c3737a45","dce58c5640a562f2587313f129add661f188c608","58cf17c3128488b9564f291f7b1b6215bb2ad696","1cef17420fe9a74a504b1d3250eaae3abe8b7595","80b2043813d1a1c57f33d5cb074760e6834dd669","da01f7fcc5c7eeba75bc09a41fdd946e65210090","14116bc543328d334ad86d5084fda3c5e91604b0","1031fefd3c3e52a3c640f8318f3e55f71669e94d","daee2efd44d40181aae30a7bafac02c3e51c10a1","3a480e9987bcbc07c5d2b85e3581e083d923b738"],"id":"67c6e52ad0a090718501b8da59a9f3a0ccd7a48f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/67c6e52ad0a090718501b8da59a9f3a0ccd7a48f","authors":[{"name":"Kewen Liao","ids":["2440545"]},{"name":"Alistair Moffat","ids":["1751760"]},{"name":"Matthias Petri","ids":["48939684"]},{"name":"Anthony Wirth","ids":["40009100"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018738"}

We introduce a record-linkage method for computing the probabilities of the candidate matches, which allows the users to either directly identify the next ancestor or narrow down the search. We also propose an efficient layout algorithm for drawing and navigating genealogical graphs. The tool is additionally used to crowdsource training and evaluation data so as to improve the matching algorithm.

These traces contain clues to the intentions and interests of those users, but service providers may find it difficult to uncover and exploit those clues. In this paper, we propose a framework for personalizing software and web services by leveraging such unstructured traces. We use 6 months of Photoshop usage history and 7 years of interaction records from 67K Behance users to design, develop, and validate a user-modeling technique that discovers highly discriminative representations of Photoshop users; we refer to the model as utilization-to-vector, util2vec. We demonstrate the promise of this approach for three sample applications: (1) a practical user-tagging system that automatically predicts areas of focus for millions of Photoshop users; (2) a twophase recommendation model that enables cold-start personalized recommendations for many new Behance users who have Photoshop usage data, improving recommendation quality (Recall@100) by 21.2% over a popularity-based recommender; and (3) a novel inspiration engine that provides real-time personalized inspirations to artists. We believe that this work demonstrates the potential impact of unstructured usage-log data for personalization.","inCitations":["1ca2086dec3b100e87d16d725b3f7559113c000b","9fec253eb41438a9ab13bd5156a18c2c08ff610a","3c1232c55389a1130fb9a03338624140adaf9ad2","9ee257a6d7c221ae82e0d2dffafca8f733a913d9","32198b46cb85068d7d5c88492a87ee72689e0603","9fcc07778a03ad05736f97d6bda280068e2dbbb3","6134f8f7c3aab3763d6ff095c55a263660e640cb","aae2904f315dc3ea9f76899312a03c1e72445733"],"pmid":"","title":"Personalizing Software and Web Services by Integrating Unstructured Application Usage Traces","journalPages":"485-493","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/444d/910939d6aee0c34cfecbf14db1877bde7109.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054183","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p485.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ylongqi/paper/YangFJHE17.pdf"],"entities":["Adobe Photoshop","Cold start","Digital footprint","Personalization","Real-time transcription","Recommender system","Tracing (software)","Usage data","User modeling","Web service"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4ccadac3d4fe2a21c6be282c528c7379a8c85caa","3f2ad283273566bb584511858ae516d28c49ea6f","05aba481e8a221df5d8775a3bb749001e7f2525e","ced6d0b0257273850af38a3757151264beefdd73","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","600191af13e7ae80885fa67ebd0a637d0e87abb5","064fb3a6f2666e17f6d411c0a731d56aae0a785e","1267fe36b5ece49a9d8f913eb67716a040bbcced","1d861bfdc41e004994e71f936e7281c62ce7c2d7","78c74cafc0c9e84d28ebb743f67bcecad402b5b1","31af4b8793e93fd35e89569ccd663ae8777f0072","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","84cb5c782a6ef18113a3b64f0451717322dc02f0","4a31ca27b987606ae353b300488068b5240633ee","714544b7cf35a3b8bdc12fb1967624a38f257a42","064c639d76fc3b769cd87d2b3a9cd76a3112d5d9","1fe2fde9d7db7b7d5f4881e90f0e7fc54e1b4534","c131c01e08276b32a111dd05835d0c93f264e09c","006f8ee7001117b35c916ede77a4eb6415ba1f27","670b8d16e9a4a41a1b34d1584d51698676a91fa5","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","1fe7498cc9be790acae031253cabb2cb28c41aac","e04528aea4422009aa22ae5130bcba1fbb257f60","052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769","9c62918ff8a6e2628872ee1b011ec230937ada41","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d"],"id":"444d910939d6aee0c34cfecbf14db1877bde7109","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/444d910939d6aee0c34cfecbf14db1877bde7109","authors":[{"name":"Longqi Yang","ids":["1683235"]},{"name":"Chen Fang","ids":["2442612"]},{"name":"Hailin Jin","ids":["39909162"]},{"name":"Matthew D.

To combat such deadly epidemic, there is an urgent need for novel tools and methodologies to gain new insights into the behavioral processes of opioid abuse and addiction. The role of social media in biomedical knowledge mining has turned into increasingly significant in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoDOA to automatically detect the opioid addicts from Twitter, which can potentially assist in sharpening our understanding toward the behavioral process of opioid abuse and addiction. In AutoDOA, to model the users and posted tweets as well as their rich relationships, a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) is first constructed. Then meta-path based approach is used to formulate similarity measures over users and different similarities are aggregated using Laplacian scores. Based on HIN and the combined meta-path, to reduce the cost of acquiring labeled examples for supervised learning, a transductive classification model is built for automatic opioid addict detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply transductive classification in HIN into drug-addiction domain. Comprehensive experiments on real sample collections from Twitter are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system AutoDOA in opioid addict detection by comparisons with other alternate methods. The results and case studies also demonstrate that knowledge from daily-life social media data mining could support a better practice of opioid addiction prevention and treatment.","inCitations":["d8b96b98cd36bcbc94b0ffd4049305d62fbee7ea","ceb31d66061422ade518ee61f9efabdcb4f8e8f8","97dca3ef15503dbf94bba18fcde28db07eaee16c","124906f9673924c85c31e26a577ae319b2495857"],"pmid":"","title":"Social Media for Opioid Addiction Epidemiology: Automatic Detection of Opioid Addicts from Twitter and Case Studies","journalPages":"1259-1267","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132857"],"entities":["Data mining","Experiment","Similarity measure","Social media","Supervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","de481259aeccffd2dbdcea8c4e9fa0ab8cd32c8b","5abf1c0ff7dc9157aedd9dfa021f8d3dcc647d9b","2011feb353fed560b0643dc9db6528317c643957","a47adcc6f6428a57bcbdc1d98b9a20cd7d75e0b2","784220a5a2ad452282f8af006a6cb5715d54d0ed","0fc2dcc4d56bd76e892d24f1121a8824e0deae8c","15b2c44b3868a1055850846161aaca59083e0529","9f7f5dad0fd0bd03050fc68176b859bc9f8f0b2b","268d9b973e823e7fdff6b2aab1695191cf8965d5","20dc1890ca65e01856f31edf10126c2ad67e9d04","1a3802bf5afe8cf0b8a6b957cb993136077bdc3c","07c44c676f9ed88c4c2cab2f257615d632c56ec7","d8b7a36933881312a6ce24e9a91be15cffcb5e3b","5abf6519803ce2195f57efd109e1f40fae86b880","bb24c9661655035a1e61cce7f2084075b6fa1194","10f272220cbca311c8379a72f9d5ba387b18c437","409b0cce867d59c941f40c66306400c32f2aaac2","001926513f4fefa454b3d926bc3b35cf38ccc689","13fae98c8f6502b8585a276d19bf29b85d09dc27","02485a373142312c354b79552b3d326913eaf86d","2f3fe6e7b7387ac6b96b122fafb8b423219b7516","fd4a23990114bb86c149c35c0feff5c055cd9c11","981d47b75e47d1efabba8d6edf1f55c72f493dd1","f22ae66b083183494f2ab0f5c7758fb03d69b05c","57da56f9753d173cfc84f85827944bdace5b5064"],"id":"e3adb12fbd126ce9abbbec86c6ac1642e61ded34","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e3adb12fbd126ce9abbbec86c6ac1642e61ded34","authors":[{"name":"Yujie Fan","ids":["2549310"]},{"name":"Yiming Zhang","ids":["1908353"]},{"name":"Yanfang Ye","ids":["7873409"]},{"name":"Xin Li","ids":["1685323"]},{"name":"Wanhong Zheng","ids":["2099300"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132857"}

Moreover, the links' weight can be positive or negative, depending on the relationship or interaction between the connected nodes. The existing methods for network clustering however are not ideal for handling very large signed weighted networks. In this paper, we present a novel method called LPOCSIN (short for \"Linear Programming based Overlapping Clustering on Signed Weighted Networks\") for efficient mining of overlapping clusters in signed weighted networks. Different from existing methods that rely on computationally expensive cluster cohesiveness measures, LPOCSIN utilizes a simple yet effective one. Using this measure, we transform the cluster assignment problem into a series of alternating linear programs, and further propose a highly efficient procedure for solving those alternating problems. We evaluate LPOCSIN and other state-of-the-art methods by extensive experiments covering a wide range of synthetic and real networks. The experiments show that LPOCSIN significantly outperforms the other methods in recovering ground-truth clusters while being an order of magnitude faster than the most efficient state-of-the-art method.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Highly Efficient Mining of Overlapping Clusters in Signed Weighted Networks","journalPages":"869-878","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3133004"],"entities":["Algorithmic efficiency","Analysis of algorithms","Assignment problem","Baseline (configuration management)","Biclustering","Cluster analysis","Cohesion (computer science)","Computational complexity theory","Experiment","Ground truth","Group cohesiveness","Linear programming","Mathematical optimization","Modal logic","Numerical analysis","Sparse matrix","Synthetic intelligence","Weighted network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2e9b18872712817e5d98bc54ea6ee8a7bd66fbeb","0b19d84d3c44222ab0d3965eedada3a037971bc3","45d84d67870fc5de3b0747d05d9971d750604e7e","50f47733233c26d458cff938ddb7bf4dc3031435","d77c29220d04398427c0a7e17d1deba94faa6e9c","1bca6db0d34dec06634aa379330aeca01dd4e4fc","2e3edd8a7614a2c2055110bb68342bab99e78667","4665f10ba0006df8d4fec85e368bcc503d57ce44","639e03c46bcf99ede801988a7825ca840943db96","09031aa6d6743bebebc695955cd77c032cd9192f","b6d33a07d55688b5a0478a0a44f8ec905376f37b","141e35263ab810983c90d47ad62eb4fab5e51717","4547356cc1e9315a66c7ddffa9362095c3727837","1562d6e590aac6e754ce750190ef17060c4a1e93","620772a8eac7f0faba58e57f01d66699d63b2c9e","a71f6d2d49eda16193bf5578662c11d3ed986355","1740ba3b5ade0dbc9044a4f6583de9a4239ab272","2b98beb92b3fd808571d42d3514ff916a0a17366","b07629b81ef70ff8f5de2d5ce18888d921b949b0","10e44c294a968ca91e361fac44aa9d0f2cdf3bd3","9df7932c7a69f4f6fad6913cdb76b070a4ddcd80","20bd45d5347f5673ce4338db2c9d1a08da124704","0bbd89f64e0f8367cbe6a77a8bf7e3b0d04775b9","a7907420b81ead10f474734f249a6f163b13fe0c","13fcafdecfe9a94ec94e9b46a26044eb9ef59948","030f6132f6b6b3336ce9b0b29c5ac4c1e368b7dc","a57fcaa74ce022297fc2ed70caa2988b8e7d9720","b6dfa48aa6c8452b1b43ae8afe0d7728314a993e","1e66ea8ded6052f3956aa5e4f001433f2686ca4d","1437415df29d3927c7851c7a0db0edd4a472d6e1","3eb2f78a3127a9c5f09fe2c455e71509fab30442"],"id":"362290c3a5a535d3cdc89f89ac10dd48c735dc94","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/362290c3a5a535d3cdc89f89ac10dd48c735dc94","authors":[{"name":"Tuan-Anh Hoang","ids":["11298055"]},{"name":"Ee-Peng Lim","ids":["1709901"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133004"}

The completions extend the partial query and are updated with subsequent modifications made to the partial query. The partial query, or more generally, the query pattern is matched against a target string collection to retrieve a candidate set of strings. A scoring function is applied to the strings in the candidate set to choose a subset of them which are then presented in a specific order as the final completions. Krishnan et al. [8] define a set of QAC modes based on how a query pattern is matched with the target string collection. Each QAC mode produces distinct candidate sets and results in different completions being presented. A taxonomy of QAC modes will help us better understand the effects of match functions, desirable characteristics of an effective QAC method and their applicability to specific scenarios. The taxonomy proposed by Krishnan et al. [8] can be further refined to multiple dimensions such as error tolerance, phrase completions (without considering the order of the tokens), and completions on sub-tokens (complete just the final token vs complete each token). From an implementation aspect, each QAC mode needs specific algorithmic strategies and index structures. We measure the computational efficiency of different implementation strategies in terms of index memory, index construction time, querying and update time. For instance, a trie [1, 6, 7] is a commonly used data structure for prefix lookup, denoted \u201cMode 1\". A different querying mode suggested by Bast andWeber [2] splits the pattern P based on white spaces and presents completions containing tokens having a prefix match with each query tokens. We call this Mode 2. Typical implementations for this mode (or its variants) use an inverted index [2, 5] to map the tokens to the documents they appear in and computes document list intersections for tokens from query pattern. If a pattern match is performed on the tokens instead of prefix match (as in Mode 2), we get \u201cMode 3\u201d.

Previous research has analysed this behaviour as a response to a death within a family unit or amongst a group of friends. We report on SMM in the context of the death of a celebrity.\n We present a comparative analysis of two social media platforms, Twitter and Sina Weibo (henceforth 'Weibo'). Uniquely, we have also sought to understand the feelings and attitudes of social media users who do not engage in SMM, but inevitably encounter the posts of others. This was accomplished through online surveys in both English and Chinese, representing the majority language groups of each platform. \n We have critically evaluated the theoretical frameworks ofslacktivism, information cascades, andherd behaviour, and found herd behaviour to be the most applicable lens for understanding our specific case study: SMM centred on the death of Chester Bennington, an American singer-songwriter best known as the lead vocalist for the group Linkin Park. \n Through a mixed method approach combining qualitative and quantitative analyses, we discovered that Twitter users, who are more likely than Weibo users to actively mourn the death of a celebrity by posting on social media, are also more likely to be emotionally affected by it. Weibo users, on the other hand, are more willing to see the content of mourning the death of a celebrity, but being more emotionally distanced, viewing SMM postings simply as news. Finally, although SMM is a manifestation of herd behaviour in our case study, we also point to an example where the power of the masses was successfully harnessed for real world effect.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Tweets, Death and Rock 'n' Roll: Social Media Mourning on Twitter and Sina Weibo","journalPages":"297-306","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201079"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"8bb059e9a26c13dfbcdb74aa0c74fba647d27e44","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8bb059e9a26c13dfbcdb74aa0c74fba647d27e44","authors":[{"name":"Xinyuan Xu","ids":["47158587"]},{"name":"Terhi Nurmikko-Fuller","ids":["1942154"]},{"name":"Bernardo Pereira Nunes","ids":["2988251"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201079"}

However, in many situations a link to an entity offers only relatively coarse-grained semantic information. This is problematic especially when the entity is related to several different events, topics, roles, and -- more generally -- when it has different aspects. In this work, we introduce and address the task of entity-aspect linking: given a mention of an entity in a contextual passage, we refine the entity link with respect to the aspect of the entity it refers to. We show that a combination of different features and aspect representations in a learning-to-rank setting correctly predicts the entity-aspect in 70% of the cases. Additionally, we demonstrate significant and consistent improvements using entity-aspect linking on three entity prediction and categorization tasks relevant for the digital library community.","inCitations":["c3e0fd442f43501a4761c880ef8a79335a7028b7"],"pmid":"","title":"Entity-Aspect Linking: Providing Fine-Grained Semantics of Entities in Context","journalPages":"49-58","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://ub-madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/44381/1/entity-aspect-linking.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3197026.3197047"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Categorization","Digital library","Entity linking","Learning to rank","Librarian","Library (computing)","Natural language processing","Semiconductor consolidation","Text corpus","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6f911f69cba8ad28d4f059eb462eebd95345920f","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002","00a3f6924f90fcd77e6e7e6534b957a75d0ced07","1d2a4018b4fc6a5f498e65d68260615dbc9e7ec6","a78d61aa1ae655f9bddfd17b903b41b15f430a56","2522ef0e77fbb6a299f89505f92d7fd1ee90b7a0","844d502387a3996f167b04e2e83117c30c22e752","a78f218cca10e387a9d3ad230fc8b447f04b9e48","00c25c96b8bf7fcff1a1e7f38698eabfc694a2c1","728c156deb76abddc3bfa27806001927053f1865","1896b3f4a6aeb327ca2dc9fbea53f0a1b130cbe9","fc23e676756b8ab0508295eddb28862eccf2d96c","35d4af572e687228a8dd2241f85d7a833fcf5e5d","242512e09c584f29ac1e840df5f4ab5d4ff5c927","229941a57e425c97803356f7bce9653d484f2941","7468963f25165936dca70cc17de04d332aeb0b22","7039b7c97bd0e59693f2dc4ed7b40e8790bf2746","4cf090824b89b4fddebc659f09ddca4aafafcdd7","3ff7b8cc06fac9fec6f825930dd62f278de33963","34c283f7611e354271b2dd6740c57070c4cf152d","66e3eb407593bfffdbd382fb3cbe8948176c5e04","837b071d4c83e0f90d3e6b6edc1a2d4ca35711fb","1906f3f736bdf8c60a89cba3dd4d9a31b8955880","5568fbe4d5c690124e3e6a69e9123ee575e6243d","2af04968f22a1828a526427e2427211799dcc5af","a0bcae2595c2ab9a6cd935362450de9c531fab37","1ba7a3660b02c51ff836cdca507ed92a419b75cb","33261d252218007147a71e40f8367ed152fa2fe0","84a29efca9a062c59632fa5eceb9c515f83f9fe4","20a773041aa5667fbcf5378ac87cad2edbfd28b7","787a505cce232736cab9a236044bd3f3e4f0dffc","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","29f3a031cfdcb44f3b19b8458adffd28ff1b2a9a","40c74d6cd28b7ca11dbea1b5531c2c7d55293474","2f4d86ccd14c124560cc8401e3ff7ffa13d24300","de6b2ad0c13ee5fca9db38a60bdd9798fb1ffa31","4d72f04dda676d561e4d4a17f307f9bf720e14c6","436aa684e7d3624c8981c7a9600870ea01595b38","0989a1ef1b3e9e663aafb994d0f6641dd5947b20","0fea95403c2a21b93946cb1ea48f1e4a4a6cf4eb","ad40e2f53f7112f4d2177df99fe5df47e2028541","0a34014c5c6680fc77fef9540e3d0f8f06bbf3c6","903772853e70cd52f6e74133660221849142eb58","b02e431b846823c76a436d4eabe4cb537420fc3c"],"id":"f9b618cc0c428c192635707ce699636b00d099a8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f9b618cc0c428c192635707ce699636b00d099a8","authors":[{"name":"Federico Nanni","ids":["3393380"]},{"name":"Simone Paolo Ponzetto","ids":["1801255"]},{"name":"Laura Dietz","ids":["3213117"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3197026.3197047"}

Multi-label data stream classification is a supervised learning problem where each instance in the data stream is classified into one or more pre-defined sets of labels. Many methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, including but not limited to ensemble-based methods. Some of these ensemble-based methods are specifically designed to work with certain multi-label base classifiers; some others employ online bagging schemes to build their ensembles. In this study, we introduce a novel online and dynamically-weighted stacked ensemble for multi-label classification, called GOOWE-ML, that utilizes spatial modeling to assign optimal weights to its component classifiers. Our model can be used with any existing incremental multi-label classification algorithm as its base classifier. We conduct experiments with 4 GOOWE-ML-based multi-label ensembles and 7 baseline models on 7 real-world datasets from diverse areas of interest. Our experiments show that GOOWE-ML ensembles yield consistently better results in terms of predictive performance in almost all of the datasets, with respect to the other prominent ensemble models.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Novel Online Stacked Ensemble for Multi-Label Stream Classification","journalPages":"1063-1072","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09994","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271774","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.09994v1.pdf"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Consistency model","Dynamic data","Ensemble forecasting","Experiment","Multi-label classification","Online algorithm","Relevance","Requirement","Supervised learning","Window function"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["83cd28c68b740c2d73d9aa8e730ace83fa6f8e65","6c2e32948af0134f0c3d85e8c262345568912208","b5c13bda74db14b90d5a40da5d4155c7e1e473eb","697349e6c83b1eb71ce41995e97345c0a41fb131","896b9c1551b7ffa347baed144582ec3b5d88f703","0bfc6add0390f1b4cfbd0e90ac71475cca88b2d5","e29d7acaba4b81b0022dff238f93006dca6d0224","51989e4f646ad45afc35c42edc0afd970a011fb4","3b3b818a22e06720c4f88c4f1e762c866618da9e","bd6172ae040aedd42f2ae3827ddb49ec0183ec7c","6b5691db1e3a79af5e3c136d2dd322016a687a0b","d23b1f704aa817911ee8630063a9d7f6cc0aa92b","26ba1eefa161daa6c7d8bee38c72bbad7534af0e","1f5d1767c57a7a5ba46c316938b65efa8b239350","572b7f31aee095262057fe17b181ac262eb94995","7ad8d4ec8dbde2cfa8decb0c1b29106fac23ca2a","ff99bf0b9bbc3878e7027878039fc84a7a91d2b7","ce578c7ad74b6ef1359cd7aa8cba597af5b30b0a","07e9728aeeb20bc33ea636d97464704c9cb828ae","4dccf498ba10e4bf4706b7a216345c1f8b31d098","a9c247aa66b49d253170400a3524ff2a4be85141","bfb4879f64c5cccd06b2b28102919a84917ea9a0","32093be6d9bf5038adb5b5b8b8e8a9b62001643c","17642d30fb4f583524fa1748c8a60467cdf127b1","34934e9d9ef2f9a6d930023479a25c851855f25e","da8bb82ce64dc6056685623f1a2202ae67fd5c3d","2abe6b9ea1b13653b7384e9c8ef14b0d87e20cfc","29e9a2739bb96b1d3d3a3270d661c61511b41699","1b3dfa08444f249934d61ab01139b9eafa64f94c","b39ebb8a14c68daa1d9c560fc342be24cf9e8660","39b6fc834b85cf181339474486873b4866959455","318a81acdd15a0ab2f706b5f53ee9d4d5d86237f","27db63ab642d9c27601a9311d65b63e2d2d26744","a23a6d28b91addda7162bbf3a0bd8cde54cbec90","1bb07913e346f33f5e3af105e2184d314f1a6cc1"],"id":"e46d8ccb0e06dc7b25724dbcaddf23edaba8e364","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e46d8ccb0e06dc7b25724dbcaddf23edaba8e364","authors":[{"name":"Alican Büyükçakir","ids":["51447696"]},{"name":"Hamed R.

Our framework inherits from recent advances in Bayesian deep learning, and extends existing work by considering the targeted crowdsourcing approach, where multiple annotators with unknown expertise contribute an uncontrolled amount (often limited) of annotations. Our framework leverages the low-rank structure in annotations to learn individual annotator expertise, which then helps to infer the true labels from noisy and sparse annotations. It provides a unified Bayesian model to simultaneously infer the true labels and train the deep learning model in order to reach an optimal learning efficacy. Finally, our framework exploits the uncertainty of the deep learning model during prediction as well as the annotators\u2019 estimated expertise to minimize the number of required annotations and annotators for optimally training the deep learning model. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework for intent classification in Alexa (Amazon\u2019s personal assistant), using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experiments show that our framework can accurately learn annotator expertise, infer true labels, and effectively reduce the amount of annotations in model training as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We further discuss the potential of our proposed framework in bridging machine learning and crowdsourcing towards improved human-in-the-loop systems.","inCitations":["418b76b07960348d3bd0e320f32f22a1c64b7b43"],"pmid":"","title":"Leveraging Crowdsourcing Data for Deep Active Learning An Application: Learning Intents in Alexa","journalPages":"23-32","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13a4/0b9ed9497b8dd7f0fdc684f97ccbef0dc6d5.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04223","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04223v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186033"],"entities":["Bridging (networking)","Crowdsourcing","Deep learning","Experiment","Machine learning","Programming paradigm","Sparse matrix","Synthetic intelligence","Uncontrolled format string"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2ae40898406df0a3732acc54f147c1d377f54e2a","b4f10bab6edf7f743a0ddfeca18d45bdcf0037fd","29f7b36d0e88d345386567189d48bdc376788264","422d9b1a05bc33fcca4b9aa9381f46804c6132fd","54dd77bd7b904a6a69609c9f3af11b42f654ab5d","4ffa64110a9c99b85e13cc3ffc276f28930218a9","39ad06da1baf758991600202ce2357157aa9798a","6953420c593842697dd09bc2cf7ffbbaf67a6e8e","124a69bddc7559c8345b01f44443c4dff363ff4c","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","51933e71bfc8329115422084144afc3072bb81ef","178631e0f0e624b1607c7a7a2507ed30d4e83a42","068eb1a12766a5e8e408e650a3e1d4b4ec7ab42d","169404f79e4453fbad46a6c24e17e081aa44fefd","5656b46eadb0519f5ecc0c42788142bc7ef1f48a","14613de563c0400378b57e873252e1b64eddd038","86d2add9aa90014a6330e3eb59277562adaeeda4","238c322d010fbc32bf110377045235c589629cba","60bc22ff917ff9ca92f17e0a2d0973a066be9096","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","42d717468805d24525b0b53badad5322b9798125","4ed0286846d776da4f7db09518557ff324d0eb24","f5d9c0182d8578f7c0a99ad9bdd4ff62e5f7c68d","3f310c55503374a5097e02ea672960537776f411","86895e573eeddb8d74683ab00807b8e2c4019eee","2116b2eaaece4af9c28c32af2728f3d49b792cf9","96c6e46e0fbb348a7209f309209ad4d5a7bccda3","24d06d524a2e5d27b3357a2aca8874b508ff343e","8cfa328c523e674ac966bbd02f4191efb6b4e7ea","5791d4c1b6f67c003915ef1ddc2da473512a32cf","818826f356444f3daa3447755bf63f171f39ec47","1b68a26449d8ec911c709a08315e2eda7a768a8f","27da8d31b23f15a8d4feefe0f309dfaad745f8b0","019463da32d7377b01147dffa2f6721e9b47c900","32de6a22689e041c643a596a62530cc1c14e1bd4","85f58cce0218a9937ced590257abe23e039c9135","052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769","9352c6392ede673f7feb9569865053bd87dc2bb5","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","22f516acc61967369ec29d4121c7b517d5f60e08","0c5087fdc438a0a228aa643296bb99c6ff12daa9","1b1fc770b9069b045a0dedf23092a1ad04cb79c1","49c6c08709d3cbf4b58477375d7c04bcd4da4520"],"id":"13a40b9ed9497b8dd7f0fdc684f97ccbef0dc6d5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/13a40b9ed9497b8dd7f0fdc684f97ccbef0dc6d5","authors":[{"name":"Jie Yang","ids":["1688428"]},{"name":"Thomas Drake","ids":["46682422"]},{"name":"Andreas Damianou","ids":["49842380"]},{"name":"Yoelle Maarek","ids":["1781257"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186033"}

The document features are always extracted based on classic textual statistics, and different features contribute differently to ranking performance. Given that well-defined features would contribute more to the retrieval performance, we investigate the usage of autoencoders to enrich the feature representations of documents. Autoencoders, as basic building blocks of deep neural networks, have been successfully used in many text mining tasks for generating effective features. To enrich the feature space for learning to rank, we introduce supervision into the loss functions of autoencoders. Specifically, we first train a linear ranking model on the training data, and then incorporate the learned weights into the reconstruction costs of an autoencoder. Meanwhile, we accumulate the costs of documents for a given query with query-level constraints for producing more useful features. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on three LETOR datasets, and show that our model can generate effective document features to improve the retrieval performance.","inCitations":["e10082551fddf56c8fb3a27e8457a0c80399f61e"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning to Rank with Query-level Semi-supervised Autoencoders","journalPages":"2395-2398","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133049"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Autoencoder","Deep learning","Feature vector","Learning to rank","Loss function","Machine learning","Ranking (information retrieval)","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Text mining"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8478c0f46dd30ef7f4052145983d6d315c2e1f17","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","0dcdc50ffd9f68e1d0f2878552329920022cfe99","3b2bf65ebee91249d1045709200a51d157b0176e","be29cc9cd74fd7d260b4571a4b72518accae5127","2e635989e232816546ef352edc38881580b04c1e","80ac6390e471b7159726bea0f0f8645f0eb6e478","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","48886ea4ee14f0151f186207e1b9ad1d947e83ef","1e300582966022da2126753fa406db29404784e1"],"id":"6a732281dda83ae9229aecd7db65566952994416","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6a732281dda83ae9229aecd7db65566952994416","authors":[{"name":"Bo Xu","ids":["1721758"]},{"name":"Hongfei Lin","ids":["37553559"]},{"name":"Yuan Lin","ids":["47905879"]},{"name":"Kan Xu","ids":["47831571"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133049"}

However, in the era of digital government documents, such as e-mail, traditional sensitivity review procedures are no longer practical, for example due to the volume of documents to be reviewed. Therefore, there is a need for new technology assisted review protocols to integrate automatic sensitivity classification into the sensitivity review process. Moreover, to effectively assist sensitivity review, such assistive technologies must incorporate reviewer feedback to enable sensitivity classifiers to quickly learn and adapt to the sensitivities within a collection, when the types of sensitivity are not known a priori. In this work, we present a thorough evaluation of active learning strategies for sensitivity review. Moreover, we present an active learning strategy that integrates reviewer feedback, from sensitive text annotations, to identify features of sensitivity that enable us to learn an effective sensitivity classifier (0.7 Balanced Accuracy) using significantly less reviewer effort, according to the sign test (p < 0.01). Moreover, this approach results in a 51% reduction in the number of documents required to be reviewed to achieve the same level of classification accuracy, compared to when the approach is deployed without annotation features.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Active Learning Strategies for Technology Assisted Sensitivity Review","journalPages":"439-453","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e221/c3e2c0bf0da9c7b1ef9984b81154335be2e5.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~graham/publications/ecir2018_mcdonald_als.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_33"],"entities":["Assistive technology","Batman: Arkham City","Document classification","E-government","Email","Information gain in decision trees","Information sensitivity","Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence","Personally identifiable information","Sampling (signal processing)","Semiconductor industry","Sensitivity and specificity","Simulation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1b607341c7d1bb22ef2d3e565e6189d838bea6ed","9377ff055de047c1e348d4e44439dc57782627e3","6fe5825fc2b7b7710e5dc3eae22f848a2843b858","19f324359b2a92a6f9a5e2b16f3c7ce5e1145ba2","0fe8982a0b71263ca9335e7c783d46b6f5c729ce","7d88cf6f71acff3680c1413cec0fa18b8710167e","c3096334ace7dadc8bfe8a9120b5e721d9c37282","b8a41e869b643e981377940143a7927cff67c792","14613de563c0400378b57e873252e1b64eddd038","6b6f187b136616c0514f384ee17dc167498ef619","42ef982529df02e6b762be0866613f76f204637a","59c9da928fbf10da0c46eef255f14aba2a8ed9a9","3b3b54848c1bc6ffea2625ce79302abed8e8deb9","6e7457ca29cc5b7e48065c3a718a09ab64873b3d","e541c475457a731d7d434c4302867fc45af5876f","13082af1fd6bb9bfe63e73cf007de1655b7f9ae0","2fb588241ef6748a8f7517b5139dcd7b468c61d5"],"id":"e221c3e2c0bf0da9c7b1ef9984b81154335be2e5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e221c3e2c0bf0da9c7b1ef9984b81154335be2e5","authors":[{"name":"Graham McDonald","ids":["38657905"]},{"name":"Craig MacDonald","ids":["2691614"]},{"name":"Iadh Ounis","ids":["1698205"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_33"}

While document creation times are available as time stamps or HTML metadata in many cases, depending on the document collection in question, this data can be inaccurate or incomplete in others. Especially in digitally published online news articles, publication times are often missing from the article or inaccurate due to (partial) updates of the content at a later time. In this paper, we investigate the prediction of document creation times for articles in citation networks of digitally published news articles, which provide a network structure of knowledge flows between individual articles in addition to the contained temporal expressions. We explore the evolution of such networks to motivate the extraction of suitable features, which we utilize in a subsequent prediction of document creation times, framed as a regression task. Based on our evaluation of several established machine learning regressors on a large network of English news articles, we show that the combination of temporal and local structural features allows for the estimation of document creation times from the network.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Predicting Document Creation Times in News Citation Networks","journalPages":"1731-1736","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1216/aed0900fb76f7d3423fb43839e8e69c1e746.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3191633","http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~jstroetge/papers/2018_TempWeb-WWWCompanion_SpitzEtAl_PredictingDocumentCreationTimes.pdf","https://dbs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/files/Team/aspitz/slides/spitz_2018_04_23_news_citation.pdf"],"entities":["Archive","Citation graph","HTML","Machine learning","Meta element","Temporal expressions"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["620f448570ef5902f48b1e39b15173afa1f0de0d","4eacaf9bc0a4dfa7017e73da1d716411f57e75ef","0adcebf863b59d4f06d724d150d499674252439b","595af8ee224fb97ac89159bb2cbe5142cdfe53f8","bedde61b845cedb90287af59573fe03958f0653e","5786b054292911a7c20c4f1f7a52ba3d69cf0c33","3b111bfb88112b9aa0dfd5f734d512c066875bdb","70ed6008cea7aca9cf75ffb11b331687c2ad1a7d","32e7984f40dcc2a55dfbdafd4eb6e6fa0090dac1","6e633b41d93051375ef9135102d54fa097dc8cf8","f346a93874a760deadaf5401ad6f5f6d5aff4a08","13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986","1d2744b83519657f5f2610698a8ddd177ced4f5c","9032ab9bd58a81812d2bd7a2890dd9cc0f4b69cc","35f9aa55a1d8aaaeb4e4a98501c326f18a1ba480","088447d1c9d41dd5c6f730e5accbfda151f91593","0f16f6f478b5c788dce466eb50e36c612273c36e","189ef562597987ef484b43ff2c9d3fca6b797309","3425dcafb9feb477325aa4983018741acb0d4369","e3804a4b95df33e8dd7e028e1344a8e05135a9a1","6402a1af5e7ce3a62802b1c1d71448f012c57e27","66e6e6f25b37c97cb13501602eb0c445a3303d9a","6a84e5ab0f7a2a3604ee5c4005951c39d726a911"],"id":"1adb522d35adc6d2f00abc5dd344f4eb530df4a2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1adb522d35adc6d2f00abc5dd344f4eb530df4a2","authors":[{"name":"Andreas Spitz","ids":["15803441"]},{"name":"Jannik Strötgen","ids":["2013656"]},{"name":"Michael Gertz","ids":["40136143"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3191633"}

Consequently, users in social networks are up-to-date with the details of real-world events and the involved individuals. Examples include crime scenes and potential perpetrator descriptions, public gatherings with rumors about celebrities among the guests, rallies by prominent politicians, concerts by musicians, etc. We are interested in the problem of tracking persons mentioned in social media, namely detecting the locations of individuals by leveraging the online discussions about them. \n Existing literature focuses on the well-known and more convenient problem of user location detection in social media, mainly as the location discovery of the user profiles and their messages. In contrast, we track individuals with text mining techniques, regardless whether they hold a social network account or not. We observe what the community shares about them and estimate their locations. Our approach consists of two steps: firstly, we introduce a noise filter that prunes irrelevant posts using a recursive partitioning technique.

Our experimental results show that isotonic regression significantly improves click models trained with suboptimal hyperparameters in terms of perplexity, and that it makes click models less sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters. Interestingly, the relative ranking of existing click models in terms of their predictive performance changes depending on whether or not their predictions are calibrated.

In this paper we propose Event2Vec, a novel way to learn latent feature vectors for news events using a network. We use recently proposed network embedding techniques, which are proven to be very effective for various prediction tasks in networks. As events involve different classes of nodes, such as named entities, temporal information, etc, general purpose network embeddings are agnostic to event semantics. To address this problem, we propose biased random walks that are tailored to capture the neighborhoods of news events in event networks. We then show that these learned embeddings are effective for news event recommendation and news event linking tasks using strong baselines, such as vanilla Node2Vec, and other state-of-the-art graph-based event ranking techniques.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Event2Vec: Neural Embeddings for News Events","journalPages":"1013-1016","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210136"],"entities":["Complex network","Digital Forensics Framework (DFF)","Feature vector","Markov chain","Named entity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["185d74cb63d33cff0e562ae7105a2ebd540d0e63","50d6ab4eb0facf0b87b162ee7515604417a2f857","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","863f25633d298043a616264d8150d3e1888762f3","57836099c13dff8662eda6943e71a78ac0bec18c","17d56526a359ab357b3a1e4eae39697b312e3e5e","8fb7f53b8808700b6d8e8d39ac4a936b841ee328","34329c7ec1cc159ed5efa84cb38ea9bbec335d19","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","7e43ec7ef23547dbb042768de7b77a714fc351ac","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","608eb7045f77868a1e219ef5fdf6d13d67d6ed3f","d47f72a0c70eac76b59a2e4c180a6344f40ffe63","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2"],"id":"2bf6cd490ef0eaa3e7e45b91db02b62c825602e2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2bf6cd490ef0eaa3e7e45b91db02b62c825602e2","authors":[{"name":"Vinay Setty","ids":["2852530"]},{"name":"Katja Hose","ids":["1682407"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210136"}

Most of the efforts in developing dynamic machine learning and data mining algorithms have been focusing on the sliding window model (where at any given point in time only the most recent data items are retained) or more simplistic models. However, in many real-world applications one might need to deal with arbitrary deletions and insertions. For example, one might need to remove data items that are not necessarily the oldest ones, because they have been flagged as containing inappropriate content or due to privacy concerns. Clustering trajectory data might also require to deal with more general update operations. We develop a (2 + ε)-approximation algorithm for the k-center clustering problem with \u201csmall\u201d amortized cost under the fully dynamic adversarial model. In such a model, points can be added or removed arbitrarily, provided that the adversary does not have access to the random choices of our algorithm. The amortized cost of our algorithm is poly-logarithmic when the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance between any two points in input is bounded by a polynomial, while k and ε are constant. Our theoretical results are complemented with an extensive experimental evaluation on dynamic data from Twitter, Flickr, as well as trajectory data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

IR metrics have been found however to be strongly biased towards rewarding algorithms that recommend popular items \"the same bias that state of the art recommendation algorithms display. Recent research has confirmed and measured such biases, and proposed methods to avoid them. The fundamental question remains open though whether popularity is really a bias we should avoid or not; whether it could be a useful and reliable signal in recommendation, or it may be unfairly rewarded by the experimental biases. We address this question at a formal level by identifying and modeling the conditions that can determine the answer, in terms of dependencies between key random variables, involving item rating, discovery and relevance. We find conditions that guarantee popularity to be effective or quite the opposite, and for the measured metric values to reflect a true effectiveness, or qualitatively deviate from it. We exemplify and confirm the theoretical findings with empirical results. We build a crowdsourced dataset devoid of the usual biases displayed by common publicly available data, in which we illustrate contradictions between the accuracy that would be measured in a common biased offline experimental setting, and the actual accuracy that can be measured with unbiased observations.","inCitations":["194aeaa1206692683a58067c047c96dc7c5f041a","bbcc93db772639d6f20e271e11b900cbaddb5ad1","275d3cfe57353021da8965877e0c4e2555af54b0"],"pmid":"","title":"Should I Follow the Crowd?: A Probabilistic Analysis of the Effectiveness of Popularity in Recommender Systems","journalPages":"415-424","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://ir.ii.uam.es/pubs/sigir2018.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210014"],"entities":["Algorithm","Crowdsourcing","Design of experiments","Exemplification","Experiment","Interference (communication)","Online and offline","Personalization","Probabilistic analysis of algorithms","Randomness","Recommender system","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["09c162757d253a61b4b20f975cea58a1554a8917","2c9b99c886ed0bf82b7fd3ccdce52dd9b7f10397","4fb20ba0e882ba9a92952c3e333407327a7f1d8f","7d986dac610e20441adb9161e5466c88932626e9","8735340bed4503bf21e50ec65872ceee68301470","7c2cb0272af5817cd58fb1707d6e5833c851d72b","882e4f3e3f8cbbd8cffde451578dff7a1cbc1b4c","2cd0cb7f6c9f1fb1d27d870948755d8fe0cd5a7c","0302f692e8abb8575c4706d2fa1146309422c44b","13e9052ec45b81b262a1dd72e81368ef5ea0a1be","8590191ffbce6601d0afb9887a668b2653452fe3","d100d9a3004a4565f05465f1991f64b918097aaa","276ebc620a8976026bd2d03582b9ecfa3738d43c","00f1ee4a4264480edc8355a26b8dfbbdfc2b33aa","1109e93f93a8ddd0d4802e73e81900b671246dc1","7383194e0a26c344f483ebb841945e80f84cfe5e","0b387adf32a1d978378d0e49651013624de42473","940b01d0d7931cb9d4d24f5bd50625b941b31a13","2226c7ca7a035133836d55b45005bbe029b79b39","d5fdc3c0b2049a025091179a73e0e4174105fcd4","c699c8769d52a0040441b05c1b22b624b5217c85","cd6ddf13877b067e0a47c0a1663125e2a7f547d6","8ac3efcccf2a92ae19830d5fc19627785a52d4bd","e9efa29945c7f29478971155cdac77236f50bba1","8a7f5f7d9754be7b2180c7748fb8c97695b48a67","03ef3144e78efcb3d0fa7b2fabe8641ef7dfd1d2","076ddb6d7b62ed5d4600dae6422184c1bc61e395","2845eda7ce8de14e351d41182f92b73ece8873ef","681e4d3112c126486dbcc174a3174c25a926a83f","098c57f75479813c2cdc848ab16ef41d87353702","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","da9c08584f5a5379eac9f947cf4437d85b919084","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701"],"id":"dc6f76cb0036c26560de4e8512042d2576f84b38","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dc6f76cb0036c26560de4e8512042d2576f84b38","authors":[{"name":"Rocío Cañamares","ids":["3247627"]},{"name":"Pablo Castells","ids":["2912921"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210014"}

Our solution roots in the social comparison theory that humans tend to form groups with others of similar minds and ability, and the cognitive consistency theory that mutual influence inside groups will eventually shape group norms and attitudes, with which group members will all shift to align. We formalize personalized sentiment classification as a multi-task learning problem. In particular, to exploit the clustering property of users\u2019 opinions, we impose a non-parametric Dirichlet Process prior over the personalized models, in which group members share the same customized sentiment model adapted from a global classifier. Extensive experimental evaluations on large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution: it outperformed user-independent classification solutions, and several stateof-the-art model adaptation and multi-task learning algorithms.","inCitations":["3c01a75ff2535880a3a29361ea39f04fd1d1e17f","e7d485d8c1bf1b1f43cd1084d52a3e33acc7f19b","6d5fe2873be7e2b86d35ac180de5f7cd08c3bd3b"],"pmid":"","title":"Clustered Model Adaption for Personalized Sentiment Analysis","journalPages":"937-946","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2af6/654439fa3bc24beb258905673396012b5a8e.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lg5bt/files/www2017.pdf","http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/paper/fp1158-gongA.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052693","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p937.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Align (company)","Cluster analysis","Computer multitasking","Machine learning","Multi-task learning","Personalization","Sentiment analysis","Statistical classification"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c6ef3955c8c4bf826b2c33e5c1bccc84720c8f3b","4382713699dc364791c7a4a4d62bca1cf2ecc476","8bbcded0c093f62bd2a54cad58bcc8114aed5aa6","d86b82ceb0909b0b5f1c51d79a09b7a2915cafd7","2697bcbf991350c0f1adf88bb0c519c597ffc79c","53a34df7523f41a86aa7078c7c4758361d8c417e","0a7fb47217e6d0e3b80159bc4f9e02a50ea1f391","89c808af926ecb20870b2521fbaa7dcbb85be106","33566db6125d0f7d5af5ce7d7a5da161859422c5","060caa84635b12111a33f491583a0e4a38557d1a","263f103fd2bfbbd6aeb392c6519d3f590e647c0a","07d1db388cd489420d40d0edb13e074d86c77dbd","05bd81538cbf475f47e1a2a8f416b271ae494bbb","4781b899447abc3439eb785281aa754126f1d818","7cd0b2b3c545ef9cd3f851d2b5039961b040d877","3aae960155251d70567cbabf227ab68903a90012","a88ee5dd5f9605403daddb846a60c7ed75dd7f54","b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d","36cb4ed29f9f0b6ea37343b3d98154293a374ec2","a25fbcbbae1e8f79c4360d26aa11a3abf1a11972","5b7c0333b593def46571f6001b48e7c66d3914e2","ca781a2fc31a28f653b222ca8afdedc90a009266","42e99c761f860e1d93115ce34345d0d229abb98e","09f0885d1727a0b82300e94856e0be2f2f72561c","465bca75550506054c25b356da2012a7f87ac8cd","0cc681296eba487fce17892d0fb31dbe4f6a631e","02b06216792c921f93a63336884b59aeff29f373","ad830a973bd1a2d681b84c58b5aa1e5228e27fb7","4e846c4979800b0528371899c0096d7f03284e63","65bfab252d56189b0b52f52ff9b800857b71e72f","3d5a1904127679f50e1b3fdad77c342760e4b283","4f1fe957a29a2e422d4034f4510644714d33fb20","6de4e806365af08e3445eb374fee96df74e08384"],"id":"27dd82dc196f9c6e66245789e6caa425a094aefa","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/27dd82dc196f9c6e66245789e6caa425a094aefa","authors":[{"name":"Lin Gong","ids":["47860782"]},{"name":"Benjamin Haines","ids":["39357529"]},{"name":"Hongning Wang","ids":["31825390"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052693"}

The notification mechanism is an evolution in the user interaction paradigm by keeping users updated without checking applications. Conversational agents are posed to be the next revolution in user interaction paradigms. However, without intelligence on the triage of content served by the interaction and content differentiation in applications, interaction paradigms may still place the burden of information overload on users. In this paper, we focus on the problem of intelligent identification of actionable information in the content served by applications, and in particular in productivity applications (such as email, chat, messaging, social collaboration tools, etc.). We present eAssistant, which offers a novel fine-grained action identification method in an adaptive, personalizable, and online-trainable manner, and a cognitive agent/API that uses action information and user-centric conversation characteristics to auto-triage user conversations. The introduced method identifies individual actions and associated metadata; it is extensible in terms of the number of action classes; it learns in an online and continuous manner via user interactions and feedback, and it is personalizable to different users. We have evaluated the proposed method using real-world datasets. The results show that the method achieves higher accuracy compared to traditional ways of formulating the problem, while exhibiting additional desired properties of online, personalized, and adaptive learning. In eAssistant, we introduce a multi-dimensional learning model of conversations auto-triage, defined based on a user study and NLP-based information extraction techniques, to auto-triage user conversations on social collaboration and productivity tools. ∗The work has been done while the author has been a research intern at IBM Almaden Research Center.

This has given rise to many fact-checking websites that manually assess doubtful claims. However, the speed and scale at which misinformation spreads in online media inherently limits manual verification. Hence, the problem of automatic credibility assessment has attracted great attention. In this work, we present CredEye, a system for automatic credibility assessment. It takes a natural language claim as input from the user and automatically analyzes its credibility by considering relevant articles from the Web.

In crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, rewards also play an important part in influencing project success. Designing rewards consisting of the appropriate items is a challenging yet crucial task for the project creators. However, prior research has not considered the strategies project creators take to offer and bundle the rewards, making it hard to study the impact of reward designs on project success. In this paper, we raise a novel research question: understanding project creators' decisions of reward designs to level their chance to succeed. We approach this by modeling the design behavior of project creators, and identifying the behaviors that lead to project success. We propose a probabilistic generative model, Menu-Offering-Bundle (MOB) model, to capture the offering and bundling decisions of project creators based on collected data of 14K crowdfunding projects and their 149K reward bundles across a half-year period. Our proposed model is shown to capture the offering and bundling topics, outperform the baselines in predicting reward designs. We also find that the learned offering and bundling topics carry distinguishable meanings and provide insights of key factors on project success.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling Menu Bundle Designs of Crowdfunding Projects","journalPages":"1079-1088","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132958"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Crowdfunding","Generative model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"f62b5f31ba1e339ed9da39d982a535692660d692","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f62b5f31ba1e339ed9da39d982a535692660d692","authors":[{"name":"Yusan Lin","ids":["2410838"]},{"name":"Peifeng Yin","ids":["3193264"]},{"name":"Wang-Chien Lee","ids":["1686360"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132958"}

It\u2019s unique characteristics over previous models include: (i) the exploitation of multimodal data as opposed to only visual information, (ii) robustness to outlier labels in a multi-label scenario and (iii) works effectively with large-scale weakly supervised data. With extensive quantitative evaluation, we exhibit the effectiveness of CMEM for detection of multiple labels over other state-of-the-art approaches.

Task complexity is one characteristic that has received considerable attention. One view of task complexity is through the lens of a priori determinability -- the level of uncertainty about task outcomes and processes experienced by the searcher. In this work, we manipulated the determinability of comparative tasks. Our task manipulation involved modifying the scope of the task by specifying exact items and/or exact (objective or subjective) dimensions to consider as part of the task. This paper reports on a within-subject study (N=144) where we investigated how our task manipulation influenced participants' perceptions, levels of engagement, search effort, and choice of search strategies. Our results suggest a complex relationship between task scope, determinability, and different outcome measures. Our most open-ended tasks were perceived to have low determinability (high uncertainty), but were the least challenging for participants due to satisficing. Furthermore, narrowing the scope of tasks by specifying items had a different effect than by specifying dimensions. Specifying items increased the task determinability (lower uncertainty) and made the task easier, while specifying dimensions did not increase the task determinability and made the task more challenging. A qualitative analysis of participants' queries suggests that searching for dimensions is more challenging than for items. Finally, we observed subtle differences between objective and subjective dimensions. We discuss implications for the design of IIR studies and tools to support users.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"The Effects of Manipulating Task Determinability on Search Behaviors and Outcomes","journalPages":"445-454","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210047"],"entities":["Algorithm","Faceted classification","IBM Notes","Infinite impulse response","Nonlinear gameplay","Tree traversal","Usability testing"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["16baad515cd2ac25f095324d07e6ccb4079fc173","0b83068d838d1f45ba1d55c760d547a314d55076","0f9429179e77ed0177f0e52973fa2652f9f6775d","483793c68e73e4997a70625c502fa629caf93e38","71b47e9864ee7d31ed888a5ed6b334df3d24b689","1bda874192721e2a86285f91e924c454916c526a","473649168dce72a6b8ab2bf14a2522781550ddb3","59c56132b8abae36dd0216663cd7ea8b47289dbd","eb1e77463af7b728304c88d3b61f8d0d472ea756","ac242e405b4660dcc47135816cbb0294dff63294","064a5aecb9860dbdf0bb34236628642bee15423d","74d15892e23291bfcd277893040849c20607977a","23bd74ed611412be46ac3922925c28c1294f5467","c4a6f3c8832282240c65c39a6cdf6e35b903f3f7","6d1eb878e1d2530c197c962dd4a61d2aba015261","ed4cbb28e02b3520252fe8089374deffc15800a6","70bf86727af633e0dcad2a9b4259f2de94af8b3c","cc5f66225d31cbed75790d196ce5ce76da7f0161","89c2dd4c25abcf4022ff88eeaf724cce4b69fc3a"],"id":"14a285b520594624a77d9943680c1cda47824a2a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/14a285b520594624a77d9943680c1cda47824a2a","authors":[{"name":"Robert G.

However, in many practical scenarios traditional labeling can be difficult for crowdworkers(for example, if the data is high-dimensional or unintuitive, or the labels are continuous).\n In this work, we develop a novel model for crowdsourcing that can complement standard practices by exploiting people»s intuitions about groups and relations between them. We employ a recent machine learning setting, called Ballpark Learning, that can estimate individual labels given only coarse, aggregated signal over groups of data points. To address the important case of continuous labels, we extend the Ballpark setting(which focused on classification) to regression problems. We formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and propose fast, simple methods with an innate robustness to outliers.\n We evaluate our methods on real-world datasets, demonstrating how useful constraints about groups can be harnessed from a crowd of non-experts. Our methods can rival supervised models trained on many true labels, and can obtain considerably better results from the crowd than a standard label-collection process(for a lower price). By collecting rough guesses on groups of instances and using machine learning to infer the individual labels, our lightweight framework is able to address core crowdsourcing challenges and train machine learning models in a cost-effective way.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Ballpark Crowdsourcing: The Wisdom of Rough Group Comparisons","journalPages":"234-242","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04828","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04828v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159670"],"entities":["Convex optimization","Crowdsourcing","Data point","Deep learning","Graphical user interface","Machine learning","Mathematical optimization","Optimization problem","Privacy","Supervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["bc03efddc47dc707982fd328dd5c998250b66f1a","99282e9d6a1e4bcce877c65faeec110586f7113c","6e66f021a7fdef6fc90918c1e33d97ea91ddef6f","40c6e880da4fa9d3266e2ce60342b20a1eca106e","ce615ae61d67db8537e981a0a08da7f0f2ff1cee","bf60322f83714523e2d7c1d39983151fe9db7146","2d3cc76cd74ad83066e97501dc32e52d66425d38","05fcf7d0f007d5beef631737a96768641b6de517","247b527f0a071eed4e5c43dda90b52fb01cd3eef","ede6b417fa85f436fe320f7e6c61bc043d84dba8","69705ff202612fcfee3c50d5b981ee8c3b9d68c9","ffce7be6e25c7d29bc816b895610ddf7b788c415","6acae3e35c1585652cbd6b00e4434475f18f4b85","017fa882493de1b7747f061d247d6e6364ecc3d3","278005d4234ef2e44729eaa310ef430a99572350","ae5d41570be11eb42c68e02c518ab3fe39c1ee41","09dd01e19b247a33162d71f07491781bdf4bfd00","b75419a5530cf1ba417078142c05d9b043ad56db","35ea70797c7ef6304cc135034269d42d04505219","b94887f67fa81fb4d8c57c12a973b4a5c594f8c8","d86e4c37e1e58604e79b3af26aa0d25899ede0d4","5e8ab0bb4ba4846a192c0bae45fc05b0b11db6f9","7563ed501b990740d8617e459cb63e7ac02d00f9"],"id":"b2edd6461cf351d11bb55d06ccef5a76587c5a1d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b2edd6461cf351d11bb55d06ccef5a76587c5a1d","authors":[{"name":"Tom Hope","ids":["32050020"]},{"name":"Dafna Shahaf","ids":["1805894"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159670"}

Due to their great convenience, a popular MOOC can easily attract tens of thousands of students to enroll. Hence, a challenging problem in MOOCs is to find an efficient way to grade a large scale of assignments. To address this problem, peer assessment was proposed to grade the assignments in a scalable way. In peer assessment, each student is asked to access a subset of his/her peers\u2019 assignments via a web interface, then all these peer grades are aggregated to predict a final grade for each submitted assignment. These peer grades are very noisy due to the fact that different students have different bias and reliability. Several probabilistic models were proposed to improve the accuracy of the predicted grades by explicitly modeling the bias and reliability of each student. However, existing methods assumed that all students are independent of each other while ignoring the social interactions among the students. In real life, students\u2019 grading bias are easily affected by their friends. For example, a student tends to have a tough grading standard if his/her friends are harsh graders. Following this intuition, we propose three probabilistic models for peer assessment by incorporating social connections to model the dependencies of bias among the students. Moreover, we evaluate our models in a new peer grading dataset, which is enhanced with the social information of users in the discussion forums of the MOOC platform. Experimental results show that our models improve the accuracy of the predicted grades by leveraging social connections of students.","inCitations":["7bc27a80443195f015d6f1d9f34598564c897bfc","0a9fc8f0d5012816be322261f6d172cfe0463cbf","e838bba3435548b57dff2e228d86be6a70280830","1d55bf7b91ddfe976536fac9e72886c165b3d43b"],"pmid":"","title":"Leveraging Social Connections to Improve Peer Assessment in MOOCs","journalPages":"341-349","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9bf/9ca725eb0feb7e2d9ee26d076901be57cb0c.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p341.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3041021.3054165"],"entities":["Interaction","Massive open online course","Real life","Scalability","User interface"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["652579315d767331d8e05ea46489e6bd081ef48a","21dd2790b76a57b42191b19a54505837f3969141","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","76f328a9b8e134350af258c8f87e815096762ae2","578c4bda0a3d0cfef2a87a22e2f65c4644a41cf1","2b2a9b55ead51d9789514e82dd21def14b52179a","68b464837c44e909af353f148bc79837ee4e9877","8b91083b0d5a597cacc2898448b3eb6e38630cd3","237084136ea6a07f25e79f16d40dc8053eb94325","7a59927fb02d28f61356ea5c23d2ac819881b5f9","2408a19a13fcd4f76b2fe0b5d654fe5c276e6f0e","3581ff32946ed9ed07be8e307bffd57d3b8d995e","5229ac2a184aacc0dfac7b55e345de3fc3a98fd3","35eb66c6a7b74866ba5e46f243cccf264a7eaa6f","3ab99722af923e1182f7e3ddbab0cf7da4fcd094","753a2ec1ed2f543c6734ae1cf574d698acd0abcc","038b24b41b03ad93bde593d1f8a8a5016d97b770","15b68268e0fa8590f426a8ab9ed2f008fa9b3400","0ec7cfe46c4a817f9daf9ac1bf127c8a9ac4b840","8c4184b7c7d8c7f6d2801d75832b10693d690f20","5a61035df1c7ae84a2db92c41b63b84f812ba3fd","1fc2d194d88aa4e0de42bf070069edcf173c6631","f066fa9e9f999fb81da2cfbecdee898d21b3413b","3644c8f62b01bb9cb98406618cb4f0f7b8674b6b","236c4613771834d3cfb43c450305ade107813198","52983eebb587fb6da50fbeb5e88e3288381999d9"],"id":"a9bf9ca725eb0feb7e2d9ee26d076901be57cb0c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a9bf9ca725eb0feb7e2d9ee26d076901be57cb0c","authors":[{"name":"Hou Pong Chan","ids":["23181435"]},{"name":"Irwin King","ids":["1706259"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054165"}

Extreme classification has, thus far, only been studied in the context of predicting labels for novel test points. This paper formulates the extreme classification problem when predictions need to be made on training points with partially revealed labels. This allows the reformulation of warm-start tagging, ranking and recommendation problems as extreme multi-label learning with each item to be ranked/recommended being mapped onto a separate label. The SwiftXML algorithm is developed to tackle such warm-start applications by leveraging label features. SwiftXML improves upon the state-of-the-art tree based extreme classifiers by partitioning tree nodes using two hyperplanes learnt jointly in the label and data point feature spaces. Optimization is carried out via an alternating minimization algorithm allowing SwiftXML to efficiently scale to large problems.\n Experiments on multiple benchmark tasks, including tagging on Wikipedia and item-to-item recommendation on Amazon, reveal that SwiftXML's predictions can be up to 14% more accurate as compared to leading extreme classifiers. SwiftXML also demonstrates the benefits of reformulating warm-start recommendation problems as extreme multi-label learning tasks by scaling beyond classical recommender systems and achieving prediction accuracy gains of up to 37%. Furthermore, in a live deployment for sponsored search on Bing, it was observed that SwiftXML could show significantly better ads as compared to a large ensemble of state-of-the-art techniques currently in production and could increase the relative click-through-rate by 10% while simultaneously reducing the bounce rate by 30%.","inCitations":["5c6dd157787c43b68237ebbd9e080fe609d429bb","1a000eff46611637bfa22bbf940e6d7066408ed1","17393c06e9fd49e02ce881d05926cd21630b4623"],"pmid":"","title":"Extreme Multi-label Learning with Label Features for Warm-start Tagging, Ranking & Recommendation","journalPages":"441-449","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://manikvarma.org/pubs/prabhu18.pdf","http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~yashoteja/papers/SwiftXML.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159660"],"entities":["Algorithm","Benchmark (computing)","Booting","Bounce rate","Data point","Image scaling","Information source","Multi-label classification","Recommender system","Search advertising","Search engine marketing","Software deployment","Statistical classification","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8478c0f46dd30ef7f4052145983d6d315c2e1f17","31f94b8c3e2676466bdb273263364a6d9de2b027","1ae3915647d701f155b5a92a5dfab2d9b274277c","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","0e80a25b12641468da87a5417fa128020a4dd2ef","1eb64409ce7f209f65c80e5acfbf6d2e62b350f6","2061a689341d7562ccd81e630038ec6fa4f310ac","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","0cf6fe9e975a5496e9edd53818ae5c18a2a7e66b","abfb3352a188c7f3e7ad518dcf0dbcff480bcec4","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","1b243f086e5a7879310d3abd8a8bd651d34fd85f","bf0121f325cff44af03edb2c45c8ea4206693803","63cd2482cdc8dfab89c9f98f893a6647cdfa08e0","1211d3c950e2d1cc983d7a37fff1ea5062d54284","0ce46b5c8db8720582373ffa36fde3e40f4037ec","4a31ca27b987606ae353b300488068b5240633ee","0b3b14a13ee9e3c7f454d375212c5adceb6ea8ff","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","47b7e7875ec87c26d56552b05f31a2b649ee1d16","a1aa865c6585a70bf83dd8ddf156e8a14e8add81","82a3074be5297bad6b279c006c7a5507f8c54555","010a9b2e521d75a167f3d11f6dbded100250d85a","c6fba79a90167eb1ff3fcf8378601d48158fc06b"],"id":"29d1790c665f3c48af99888d4b8e339202e25aa2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/29d1790c665f3c48af99888d4b8e339202e25aa2","authors":[{"name":"Yashoteja Prabhu","ids":["40252215"]},{"name":"Anil Kag","ids":["35544303"]},{"name":"Shilpa Gopinath","ids":["5055807"]},{"name":"Kunal Dahiya","ids":["34852523"]},{"name":"Shrutendra Harsola","ids":["35429622"]},{"name":"Rahul Agrawal","ids":["33978635"]},{"name":"Manik Varma","ids":["32463160"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159660"}

Given a duration constraint d and a set of users where each user has multiple time intervals, the goal is to find all time windows which (1) are greater than or equal to the duration d, and (2) can be covered by the intervals from as many as possible users. This problem can be applied to real scenarios where people need to determine the best time for maximizing the number of people to be involved in an activity, e.g., the meeting organization and the online live video broadcasting. As far as we know, there is no existing algorithm that can solve the problem directly. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to solve the problem, the first one is considered as a baseline algorithm called sliding time window (STW), where we utilize the start and end points of all users - intervals to construct time windows satisfying duration d. And then we calculate the number of users whose intervals can cover the current time window. The second method, named TLI, is designed based on the the data structures from the Timeline Index in SAP HANA. In TLI algorithm, we conduct three consecutive phases to achieve the purpose of efficiency improvement, namely construction of Timeline Index, calculation of valid user set and calculation of time windows. Within the third phase, we prune the number of time windows by keeping track of the number of users in current optimal time window, which can help shrink the search space. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we find TLI algorithm outperforms STW two orders of magnitude in terms of querying time.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Covering the Optimal Time Window Over Temporal Data","journalPages":"687-696","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132935"],"entities":["Algorithm","Baseline (configuration management)","Computation","Data structure","Dynamic problem (algorithms)","Incremental computing","Microsoft Windows","SAP HANA","Scalability","Simulation","Time complexity","Timeline","Transport Layer Interface"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["538c0f1b3cb118e5379d172c004626155b1514be","125a6447604601729b315c34bbade71ec23a82d0","17515ffda830728de068b6be030e1bc3252a1900","dd0da551abda06e8e4bd75aafe07581190682053","055a3d07ddf536325764befa1bbe2d062a65c495","d4b25b918737a61362ca85a1979868a19ec04577","4cd2e82f1596f44c61671e9ecd28ca5da7230a73","945aa98bd4bc480ba6500ffa38a5b89d80588a84","14ae6b3550b0a483835b0be6ea74932f93729137","0b4f3a054978202350d0459cdb5731d900970017","0447f4290970a7850f9313d84ee87ff56d8a24ce","0fc61f4bb47f46bb1ab474eccd1433a3c28b2a13","6ff6d5aaebd35f9ffa683ddb8e5b6dee9b3c9daa","4523a15a22bcabad38c81e1eba13a1bddd6704c5","3842dc51ec851b90571cffc63f74ca89ee913664","170ab861367d4d96d2d6bc8ba891da516279fe47","2422e2c77409a4b1ed14af371fb83f1722f00b7b","91f6992792e600447b9d04f3a3b3ea79224a45c5","63dd38f18d7d7e8b3cb2163971a3431d509acc94","959c0bb892da93ecb730926c41fe3a2221d2ceca","6295ed10eec820df00929dd7c6d017e5c1681640","a73fba5745c1659ef6258ee28d763f135c74779a","466bec0954dba753a6f790aad68cd0b0c8376876"],"id":"7eba3de512728df4424d7c22bed7eea7a2852750","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7eba3de512728df4424d7c22bed7eea7a2852750","authors":[{"name":"Bin Cao","ids":["40165378"]},{"name":"Chenyu Hou","ids":["3364327"]},{"name":"Jing Fan","ids":["1683088"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132935"}

Numerous subfields of biology and medicine, such as genetics, neuroimaging, and mobile health, are witnessing a data explosion that promises to revolutionize biomedical science by yielding novel insights and discoveries. To address the challenges posed by biomedical big data, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative (datascience.nih.gov). An important component of this effort is the training of biomedical researchers. To this end, the NIH has funded the BD2K Training Coordinating Center (TCC). A core activity of the BD2K TCC is to develop a web portal (bigdatau.org) to provide personalized training in data science to biomedical researchers. In this paper, we describe our approach and initial efforts in constructing ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, which powers the BD2K TCC web portal. ERuDIte harvests a wealth of resources available online for learning data science, both for beginners and experts, including massive open online courses (MOOCs), videos of tutorials and research talks presented at conferences, textbooks, blog posts, and standalone web pages. Though the potential volume of resources is exciting, these online learning materials are highly heterogeneous in quality, dif∗Florian Geigl\u2019s work was performed as a visiting PhD student at the USC Information Sciences Institute. c ©2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.

However, it is not practical to review all of the backlog with the available reviewing resources and, therefore, there is a need for automatic techniques to increase the number of documents that can be opened within a fixed reviewing time budget. In this paper, we conduct a user study and use the log data to build models to predict reviewing times for an average sensitivity reviewer. Moreover, we show that using our reviewing time predictions to select the order that documents are reviewed can markedly increase the ratio of reviewed documents that are released to the public, e.g. +30% for collections with high levels of sensitivity, compared to reviewing by shortest document first. This, in turn, increases the total number of documents that are opened to the public within a fixed reviewing time budget, e.g. an extra 200 documents in 100 hours reviewing.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Towards Maximising Openness in Digital Sensitivity Review Using Reviewing Time Predictions","journalPages":"699-706","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a64c/211ecf658d707c61b92950393cb4427cd74f.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_65","http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~graham/publications/ecir2018_mcdonald_tmo.pdf"],"entities":["Confidentiality","E-government","Email","Information sensitivity","Openness","Sensitivity and specificity","Usability testing"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6fe5825fc2b7b7710e5dc3eae22f848a2843b858","b8a41e869b643e981377940143a7927cff67c792","4c482356f444ce8d0750e7beb02fcd031efc18ed","42ef982529df02e6b762be0866613f76f204637a","e9b185f22d990e12673138a049999d761f8ee4c7","e2ad7c309062877cc94e9622cc5546c77f830525","eee77abced20dd5a5ab6e21d322e910367340ca9","5fccb74c14769762b3de010c5e8a1a7ce700d17a","2fb588241ef6748a8f7517b5139dcd7b468c61d5","7d88cf6f71acff3680c1413cec0fa18b8710167e","6b6f187b136616c0514f384ee17dc167498ef619"],"id":"a64c211ecf658d707c61b92950393cb4427cd74f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a64c211ecf658d707c61b92950393cb4427cd74f","authors":[{"name":"Graham McDonald","ids":["38657905"]},{"name":"Craig MacDonald","ids":["2691614"]},{"name":"Iadh Ounis","ids":["1698205"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_65"}

We implement these two approaches on top of Hive based on the ORC file, a common data format in column stores, and evaluate the performance of TICC using real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TICC can significantly reduce the storage overhead and process a variety of queries over large-scale data with up to 20% performance improvement over the original Hive.","inCitations":["c9ff75f0bfabf9110ce50572940b69351c44e53e"],"pmid":"","title":"TICC: Transparent Inter-Column Compression for Column-Oriented Database Systems","journalPages":"2171-2174","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133077"],"entities":["Apache Hive","Column (database)","Column-oriented DBMS","Data compression","Database","Global variable","Overhead (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4f5dc77b2ca806294b8e6c6ed0d9d01dfa79f7b2","33858d13c6d294cabf8d0b6683344c4c1d6faa34","2c5b8766a1dae62b86ba38013253ab8673f6ec44","cbd45b97b5332e4b955cd54f090baed9d2ec5a72","1455be30b0bb364ffc4c35d2cf1ee05cfb32595f","be380199d1bab45ea2ed9305e967214272b1b09e","b97f2d70e80bac44efec2eba4ecaa6b017b69b7b","0bb9602462d1f4914c1149d3e15865b188b1b6fa"],"id":"b645566e6148f3d94eee2c38c99779cca5a98b0f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b645566e6148f3d94eee2c38c99779cca5a98b0f","authors":[{"name":"Hao Liu","ids":["38314901"]},{"name":"Yudian Ji","ids":["8764417"]},{"name":"Jiang Xiao","ids":["1753988"]},{"name":"Haoyu Tan","ids":["1728553"]},{"name":"Qiong Luo","ids":["50473458"]},{"name":"Lionel M.

As data are acquired, unfortunately, they are rarely complete observations of the whole system. It is important to reliably infer the unobserved attribute values anywhere in the graphs, at certain times---either in the past or in the future. Previous work does not sufficiently capture the correlations inherent with graph topology and with time. We propose a machine learning approach using a novel probabilistic graphical model. We devise a series of algorithms to efficiently group the vertices, to learn the model parameters, and to infer the unobserved values for query processing. Furthermore, we propose a method to incrementally and automatically update the model. Finally, we perform an extensive experimental study using two real-world dynamic graph datasets to evaluate our approach.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"VTeller: Telling the Values Somewhere, Sometime in a Dynamic Network of Urban Systems.","journalPages":"577-586","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271778"],"entities":["Algorithm","Database","Experiment","Graphical model","Machine learning","Topological graph theory"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["99485775cce4c1afa7361a7fcbd3c9d362309554","3809e96b085c6bf05326e6c406203a36bc505e77","05953c4b2a048e1cc17075e9de1771d950090a03","a6f400353c138644008c905d7087ac8bd23b0a55","0a9621c60889c34e2ccc4848a58cbbcef924cf4d","0374de7c43d17a32a2a04fba8814dd89ecc841c6","44a8d3c5a91580418c0851405c7930e6d0c53e83","3b23cdc4cac89527a5079e4a56035d3462f201a5","638a710f2eea70c43a41526725c87b3d2b5d4e69","04f39720b9b20f8ab990228ae3fe4f473e750fe3","46a50e0c610016a708371947965ef2783247f77e","a1c2a3bb40a2f064f163cfdbb26628f5bef002bc","10bfc12bc444bd0299fa9907ce061b96210eeb6b","bb27d2897e90cd73e54300ef9b5a454b72e05d93","d382b9c11e5c6a8e173fbeb442545e3be8d3e3a5","6873a4db9703c9bf38ddabf9abed17ac5b673b59"],"id":"501cee82c5294ec14999acf2b873d27753bf02ca","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/501cee82c5294ec14999acf2b873d27753bf02ca","authors":[{"name":"Yan Li","ids":["50025693"]},{"name":"Tingjian Ge","ids":["2872698"]},{"name":"Cindy X.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between mobile users\u2019 implicit interest inferred from attention metrics, such as eye gaze or viewport time, and explicit interest expressed by users. We present the first quantitative gaze tracking study using front-facing camera of mobile devices instead of specialized, expensive eye-tracking devices. We focus on multi-column digital media pages in Google Play Store that display 30+ items per page belonging to diverse categories. In such pages, we find significantly different distribution of gaze metrics on items that users rate as interesting vs. not. We leverage this insight by building a prediction model that is able to infer a user\u2019s interest ratings from the the non-click actions of the user. Our model is able to attain AUC of 90.32% in predicting user interest at an individual item level. In addition, our experiments on collection item re-ranking show how user gaze and viewport signals can be used to personalize item ranking on the collection page. Beyond understanding users\u2019 attention behavior in novel contexts such as multi-column digital media pages in Google Play Store, the findings in this study have implications for the design of a novel personalization and recommendation mechanism by (1) prioritizing items that are most likely of interest to users based on historical attention signals, and (2) prioritizing positions receiving significant portion of gaze attention.","inCitations":["c350852bc3cdf37449f25cdbd1c4842408a0834b","275276c01f662dfcdea9923bc31b75d50de7fbc8","5131d7d69c57f8d1857659eec9810a843e92b115","02a6498c20b517e3fadf9445e4226bc28b5105aa"],"pmid":"","title":"Towards Measuring and Inferring User Interest from Gaze","journalPages":"525-533","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/25af/e234435ede5fd95e47c3b58ed2c1da318f46.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/www.cs.cornell.edu/~yli/papers/www17-cr.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~yli/papers/www17-cr.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054182"],"entities":["Digital media","Experiment","Eye tracking","Mobile device","Personalization","Play Store","Relevance","Viewport"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["11190a466d1085c09a11e52cc63f112280ddce74","f591c9d0210a0ecfd98b8ae4bce943d42f636cb1","dbcd79bd7edcdcbb5912a50796fc3c2746729eb5","f237e72b2d5265da4c213e3c69979395728137dc","26bb234091d596bd431e8a924931ad219c067ae6","8748c232a93cfe595de6938f209a170fca51c1d5","076eb1ab94744ec20e8cf34d7eba6be620dfa81e","0ca665d223375ddba1c2e13d54895ac245f2c3c1","84bd007b64d8f2d99d9bbde3a232f55da00283bc","208371961aae57d5d281b3b54716a157cb762c84","bd11602566b54dc3183af4cfede0dca914a6627b","08b48058cd560bfe02809155331f05bd77502e55","050f2c5ecdd39d261582b3e4aec8cf13c5d14ed0","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","d5c2c62baa3dac194e03afba955ba4c9db84a69d","6e633b41d93051375ef9135102d54fa097dc8cf8","280536a4c5ef27df84720118964ee7805984e4d4","44c990cdec924eedbea7d21e39452cb6b0e4f3bd","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","564049721e97ee01c4f6b315bf4c98293f1b2fa6","3453d79657e8f3e1614e73608f92465ab7f5a291","2d26fcf385ee2c4baef9150d0870836f3ff0a0f9","9c700c9cfd23753fa8630862cff2f2212b781fc8","30b335720b55fe93de970cae860d2dc23f489fc2","0df0d1adea39a5bef318b74faa37de7f3e00b452","342be3d0e7529e63d16d1b22dbddf26d63e14bd6"],"id":"25afe234435ede5fd95e47c3b58ed2c1da318f46","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/25afe234435ede5fd95e47c3b58ed2c1da318f46","authors":[{"name":"Yixuan Li","ids":["7769997"]},{"name":"Pingmei Xu","ids":["2366042"]},{"name":"Dmitry Lagun","ids":["2568110"]},{"name":"Vidhya Navalpakkam","ids":["2575582"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054182"}

We believe the ability to ask questions so as to actively clarify the user needs is one of the most important advantages of conversational search and recommendation. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a unified conversational search/recommendation framework, in an attempt to make the research problem doable under a standard formalization. Specifically, we propose a System Ask -- User Respond (SAUR) paradigm for conversational search, define the major components of the paradigm, and design a unified implementation of the framework for product search and recommendation in e-commerce. To accomplish this, we propose the Multi-Memory Network (MMN) architecture, which can be trained based on large-scale collections of user reviews in e-commerce. The system is capable of asking aspect-based questions in the right order so as to understand the user needs, while (personalized) search is conducted during the conversation, and results are provided when the system feels confident. Experiments on real-world user purchasing data verified the advantages of conversational search and recommendation against conventional search and recommendation algorithms in terms of standard evaluation measures such as NDCG.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Towards Conversational Search and Recommendation: System Ask, User Respond","journalPages":"177-186","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://yongfeng.me/attach/conv-search-rec-zhang2018.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271776"],"entities":["Academic Search","Algorithm","Coherence (physics)","E-commerce","Experiment","Mystery meat navigation","Natural language","Network architecture","Norm (social)","Personalization","Personalized search","Programming paradigm","Purchasing","Question answering","Recommender system","User review","Web search engine","dialog"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["84b520a8d6de79f62bb095b565d077e95bfb6f5b","1b29786b7e43dda1a4d6ee93f520a2960b1e3126","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","06e7ba45e4def91c280360791031f2b24d9898e5","0dc505b3d140d9349a2f4dd87cebfa97687f0c08","2e57bccb74bcb46cbc5b4225b62679023ed1f9da","2685cab753e4c1e9ac6e68b28ad8e2e1f3673f73","0ece9e2827d0af7f47bef2e14e3d8986556e1bad","42ab3412e8a85c32929c2dbdc970c35df89bf5b3","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","32961dfdb85d83e1b33b957f92f1776a149fb837","2fea79706d001494573f4b416463de9597ebb465","0a5feab178ddb179a37f3a19b69b4a956ed797d8","06b231ed33b173b8fc91aa7fdfc9644f2cb0d60d","7a7d290d2feda000027831cbba76b7e38bf18c90","9916eef828b461051d4c0b090e82aef8d4855485","24d31924b294ee9e6c41425b43cb382c535a486d","36cb4ed29f9f0b6ea37343b3d98154293a374ec2","34e46b00dcba29a9630ee47176750852007952c7","10ebd5c40277ecba4ed45d3dc12f9f1226720523","14a7c54fce5ed04118942ac5b2f382819dd76bcb","6e565308c8081e807709cb4a917443b737e6cdb4","17ce7734904a6162caa24e13a9454c1239924744","32158f9c61a1732ffdb76269326fe3c357297388","0b8759d61e93b809df16d9fe9010d2a2d7241c74","73a76dd71abfbd29dbba4ea034ab52284626aa71","9eb67ca57fecc691853636507e2b852de3f56fac","e416a86418a86b1c5bffb690e4b70583e9401422","6ab7024ee8d08e393188a72cec6f32037905e9bc","04ee77ef1143af8b19f71c63b8c5b077c5387855","052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769","165db9e093be270d38ac4a264efff7507518727e","3a835cc957139f9caf0b9ec93b0d1889f4ac2857","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","0587ab2146fd821b216a99fb8eab51024d43a973","460123699ced86c37f830770279c8d67add2c684","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","0a22389bd99b7efe3627ec6fc77ddaf3ff5e2faa","001df9e3da7b78e007ec8494606ad4e4d4dabd35","b2624c3cb508bf053e620a090332abce904099a1","ae1b4eb285f461cfbd638ab85b504e39f4c8a907","99f5d79da460a87b2fe802f3d70a83d58e4d0daf"],"id":"3ae5bef6b0c8317603a2deab2527383580904fd8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ae5bef6b0c8317603a2deab2527383580904fd8","authors":[{"name":"Yongfeng Zhang","ids":["1739818"]},{"name":"Xu Chen","ids":["48282714"]},{"name":"Qingyao Ai","ids":["35531065"]},{"name":"Liu Yang","ids":["49576068"]},{"name":"W.

In this work, we scale up our rationale-based judging design to assess its reliability on the 2014 TREC Web Track, collecting roughly 25K crowd judgments for 5K document-topic pairs. We also study having crowd judges perform topic-focused judging, rather than across topics, finding this improves quality. Overall, we show that crowd judgments can be used to reliably rank IR systems for evaluation. We further explore the potential of rationales to shed new light on reasons for judging disagreement between experts and crowd workers. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis distinguishes subjective vs.\\ objective forms of disagreement, as well as the relative importance of each disagreement cause, and we present a new taxonomy for organizing the different types of disagreement we observe. We show that many crowd disagreements seem valid and plausible, with disagreement in many cases due to judging errors by the original TREC assessors.

One solution is semantic hashing which designs binary codes to accelerate similarity search. Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to the semantic hashing problem and produces high-quality compact binary codes compared to traditional methods. However, most state-of-the-art semantic hashing approaches require large amounts of hand-labeled training data which are often expensive and time consuming to collect. The cost of getting labeled data is the key bottleneck in deploying these hashing methods. Motivated by the recent success in machine learning that makes use of weak supervision, we employ unsupervised ranking methods such as BM25 to extract weak signals from training data. We further introduce two deep generative semantic hashing models to leverage weak signals for text hashing. The experimental results on four public datasets show that our models can generate high-quality binary codes without using hand-labeled training data and significantly outperform the competitive unsupervised semantic hashing baselines.","inCitations":["d9a633d57312f59393fcf98e1f5f25b3b5cbf904"],"pmid":"","title":"Deep Semantic Text Hashing with Weak Supervision","journalPages":"1109-1112","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.cse.scu.edu/~yfang/Deep_Semantic_Text_Hashing_Weak_Supervision.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210090"],"entities":["Binary code","Deep learning","Hash function","Information retrieval","Machine learning","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Similarity search","Supervised learning","Unsupervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["303eef410700063913f9e6ad349a0830dbccefb8","4736c3d6f33569e2a3fef2b6617d4b7ae782ce94","3f1e54ed3bd801766e1897d53a9fc962524dd3c2","6a52cb078087274e53337210a868c5d849421da4","595d0fe1c259c02069075d8c687210211908c3ed","0f88de2ae3dc2ec1371d1e9f675b9670902b289f","343f5b028a447f57c3ee49ed39b3c163d0fc88f6","1379ad7fe27fa07419b7f6956af754bdb6d49558","1a0f660f70fd179003edc271694736baaa39dec4","6184ddbe780cb934f036b04dd1d28226b6bcbcce","5909654507b9567e925358eeca505656a880ffc7","141487cd6d32f6916bdcb029ac8159eba44e23de"],"id":"0a1d7d955fe01206c71e393444c1a9b4cea09c0d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0a1d7d955fe01206c71e393444c1a9b4cea09c0d","authors":[{"name":"Suthee Chaidaroon","ids":["21746902"]},{"name":"Travis Ebesu","ids":["9701534"]},{"name":"Yi Fang","ids":["48802863"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210090"}

A Navbox is a table in Wikipedia article page that provides a consistent navigation system for related entities. Navbox is critical for the readership and editing efficiency of Wikipedia. In this paper, we target on the automatic generation of Navbox for Wikipedia articles. Instead of performing information extraction over unstructured natural language text directly, an alternative avenue is explored by focusing on a rich set of semi-structured data in Wikipedia articles: linked entities. The core idea of this paper is as follows: If we cluster the linked entities and interpret them appropriately, we can construct a high-quality Navbox for the article entity. We propose a clustering-then-labeling algorithm to realize the idea. Experiments show that the proposed solutions are effective. Ultimately, our approach enriches Wikipedia with 1.95 million new Navboxes of high quality.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Automatic Navbox Generation by Interpretable Clustering over Linked Entities","journalPages":"1857-1865","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132899"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cluster analysis","Display resolution","Entity","Experiment","Feature engineering","Information extraction","Linked list","Natural language","Norm (social)","Semantic similarity","Semi-structured data","Semiconductor industry","Web navigation","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a9e69b796a50ac0fa168f7676eb5888354e17dc","f1f071608ebdbad4685b88225cdfa5dbcbfbb08c","018d686bc93bf0c1216f1a7f8f16a2246b477829","20946812cbb90c866b0928c7a8e3b5c36b62a600","468942a616ac29e00d6eb80aeab58b564cbd5e1e","1f906f304c54d401f9e3f83f678da2733285764b","0ca10537743b43c8d8aac5a4949e8b4f1a6b5fd8","c09ab96d68ad9abc08c01885f293bbea0b9ee7c4","57faa0e5f99442d1723d2c5ccb70b1461987a7ed","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","85f60ebaba0f926cd9cd87f6f31b289f3fd59374","00a3f6924f90fcd77e6e7e6534b957a75d0ced07","6c5b5adc3830ac45bf1d764603b1b71e5f729616","14134664b7ff476479553196cc79da88bc87b463","617f858551c9ecb0a048eec7dc5b97e34a39ef66","2c69bbb3b7ba3f324276924bab6f41de467c928a","962ec64f876c657c278fb1143dee7cc98f2affb0","36adffb9c5f15b6459e4a4ec796737a09b673697","0483f11717096a27648de7ee73780db3233bf306","1971425c8e95d75dca4fec126504d7fa6179c926","9bae51fce09dd0ce3d5202e340002b79871c78e8","a00da1459445c1f714aee020ae7da8b2dd60ae38","4e3f8c0c0743097850d6c198e216f77a04e22d24","4fa0d9c4c3d17458085ee255b7a4b7c325d59e32","295bc470c79b43c07ae50a427e6a4a92041e85d3","6ef1aa88b1998ab1fc2db2160b04f90a16def24a","28992e3ae9d81939125e87d7197f7d15abdae2ce","4e66ab23f0b0bf50e9265f68273d928b4e47a07c","fe049d4b67148051cd50b53e8bffb366ca79a7d3"],"id":"83a734d923d6dab103a8eb34e7bd8851272b3dca","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83a734d923d6dab103a8eb34e7bd8851272b3dca","authors":[{"name":"Chenhao Xie","ids":["2238837"]},{"name":"Lihan Chen","ids":["47818117"]},{"name":"Jiaqing Liang","ids":["3366523"]},{"name":"Kezun Zhang","ids":["1885235"]},{"name":"Yanghua Xiao","ids":["3011950"]},{"name":"Hanghang Tong","ids":["8163721"]},{"name":"Haixun Wang","ids":["1745000"]},{"name":"Wei Wang","ids":["47824598"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132899"}

While detecting coordinated attacks by their behaviour (e.g. different accounts posting the same images or links, fake profiles, etc.) has been already explored, here we look at detecting coordination in the content (words, phrases, sentences). We are proposing a metric capable of capturing the differences between organic and coordinated posts, which is based on the estimated probability of coincidentally repeating a word sequence. Our simulation results support our conjecture that only when the metric takes the context and the properties of the repeated sequence into consideration, it is capable of separating organic and coordinated content.

A critical prerequisite to personalization is establishing user identity. However the variety of devices, including mobile phones, appliances, and smart watches, from which users access web services from both anonymous and logged-in sessions poses a significant obstacle to user identification. The resulting entity resolution task of establishing user identity across devices and sessions is commonly referred to as \u201cvisitor stitching.\u201d We introduce a general, probabilistic approach to visitor stitching using features and attributes commonly contained in web logs. Using web logs from two real-world corporate websites, we motivate the need for probabilistic models by quantifying the difficulties posed by noise, ambiguity, and missing information in deployment. Next, we introduce our approach using probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a statistical relational learning framework capable of capturing similarities across many sessions and enforcing transitivity. We present a detailed description of model features and design choices relevant to the visitor stitching problem. Finally, we evaluate our PSL model on binary classification performance for two real-world visitor stitching datasets. Our model demonstrates significantly better performance than several state-of-the-art classifiers, and we show how this advantage results from collective reasoning across sessions.","inCitations":["b93a5412d66fe9274cde2cff947f3fc6c148cef4"],"pmid":"","title":"Probabilistic Visitor Stitching on Cross-Device Web Logs","journalPages":"1581-1589","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ab09/0566c378af6452d1933cf544d2d68b0b13ad.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052711","https://www.jaypujara.org/pubs/2017/kim:www17/kim-www17.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1581.pdf"],"entities":["Binary classification","Blog","Collective intelligence","Login","Mobile phone","Personalization","Probabilistic soft logic","Smartwatch","Software deployment","Statistical relational learning","Vertex-transitive graph","Web service"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9f353e7a9e8209dc8438c5654624e0eba5a2f832","86f089e8a560b174d17d9a401338053f4fe84f7f","3362e52374641b18b45fd4c386eb3b01133213b3","94eaee984b3017a3be3a386c3ae42b243494f62a","074f3e9f973e6127dfe2eb74a51c15594ce15e25","70baffbf8a5fc1663c64892eb58a356ac19df247","66345943406ffcc03e623dad01ee3842986e72c3","3bbfc62fc13ca27c6e58e42167a6aef593a1365e","1a5ced36faee7ae1d0316c0461c50f4ea1317fad","57a809faecdeb6c97160be4cab0d0b2f42ed3c6f","351a3d2ffa62ab73995366fabe1590859e036ffd","104d4e946e6fd293c0a6444b38999e7f829dc6f8","5a032460c589a67e7c73b19c93aa591331758139","ccdaa660c5ce9849013191c6aca366e7099979b3","08d44fc5285e16a837ed637dc36399cf851a60e1","1eb156ea1230313f78eb1f8d86d26f4dde1447b5","7f1d5a12fecdac5d58ccf57790a1410c27e084af","27b2c6ba78c48af54239366f346b57227cccb666","1567f3846496e19f6b00c609ab8c41e62ea89286","245e0f1ed3fdfab4094f0dd07cbd40fa9c631878","4b168af7ae0e863bc2b385091f367d62dab63106","642ce4d2de1e159af563143b2bdde706c0b0f7d2","1eaa56eca299cd99bd1c6bd2e0851890f583633c","261efb84ba57c23a6f7f9816aa8870a57641b967","472d074f4f4d3ec50ac91826e68665ed4de515b0","49ab97ac862ff75df8c651abbcce308c671545cd","1648925708e67e58485003fc2eb2b0a5e03f842c"],"id":"ab090566c378af6452d1933cf544d2d68b0b13ad","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ab090566c378af6452d1933cf544d2d68b0b13ad","authors":[{"name":"Sungchul Kim","ids":["2939760"]},{"name":"Nikhil Kini","ids":["1870760"]},{"name":"Jay Pujara","ids":["2634786"]},{"name":"Eunyee Koh","ids":["35910905"]},{"name":"Lise Getoor","ids":["1746034"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052711"}

All of these methods have severe disadvantages and are not always suitable though: They are not very precise, not guaranteed to be persistent or mean a big additional effort for the author, who needs to collect the metadata to describe the reference accurately. Especially for complex, evolving entities and objects like software, pre-defined metadata schemas are often not expressive enough to capture its temporal state comprehensively. We found in previous work that a lot of meaningful information about software, such as a description, rich metadata, its documentation and source code, is usually available online. However, all of this needs to be preserved coherently in order to constitute a rich digital representation of the entity. We show that this is currently not the case, as only 10% of the studied blog posts and roughly 30% of the analyzed software websites are archived completely, i.e., all linked resources are captured as well. Therefore, we propose Micro Archives as rich digital object representations, which semantically and logically connect archived resources and ensure a coherent state. With Micrawler we present a modular solution to create, cite and analyze such Micro Archives. In this paper, we show the need for this approach as well as discuss opportunities and implications for various applications also beyond scholarly writing.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Micro Archives as Rich Digital Object Representations","journalPages":"353-357","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201110"],"entities":["Archive","Blog","Coherent states","Documentation","Entity","Persistent data structure","Unique identifier","Virtual artifact","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a2a0e31bc8508e5600df28a9b0dca3cd2019c50f","3f5d0fed7404fa14b61bbcd36e3300eb786ec1d8","5cabcfd84414e92221f0fb99f679669c549e14d0","1be51a5dfdbbf260b1a54a124ea5106e37928ee7","5cd5eba198e211ad382a858a9a6b4cc86e1a3bca","8b8afa7caa8ff8ffa7ea19a0b875854b1a1b2e1b","52fa7c76c7c4e57df748a23ad64453bfb9a79346","27b5f5c185c7051882ef7edd35df4256ef6e3df0","884493f39be088551d2d235b487ef1bd97e54f44","308d4d3ccaf04d60b27265c55e2afa169c726246","2cbf666423f44b17db4ef8698dcaf6c50a6a2825","1c1e63153b2fb3f950bbf9767e6db025a8aa07db","29fd10c7183032840bc59e00656b3ceb4ad1b689","09085fb7eda56fefee5ef970caffe287194911b0","3cf93e3a355eb1d7bf87469782bbf467db3d84e8","0aa657ab21512cabb3be3fb45ed2bb2552d270a5","9e3c10d608b87d0b1ca86636ddc6272b2cef5536","3aee9d3e906d1410bfd4020916551edb90c609f6","e07a502ea2d2664bb1518b1706ff72889c347fc4","c3cf5475aa946a6a6ce6b984a81c8de574511ffa"],"id":"cb8e23a05bbea6b59a22f89e4f989b71b30d472b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cb8e23a05bbea6b59a22f89e4f989b71b30d472b","authors":[{"name":"Helge Holzmann","ids":["40148339"]},{"name":"Mila Runnwerth","ids":["2442635"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201110"}

Software developers have various alternatives to contribute themselves to the communities and collaborate with others. However, nowadays there is no effective recommender suggesting developers appropriate repositories in both the academia and the industry. Although existing one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) approaches can be applied to this problem, they do not consider particular constraints of social coding such as the programming languages, which, to some extent, associate the repositories with the developers. The aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of leveraging user programming language preference to improve the performance of OCCF-based repository recommendation. Based on matrix factorization, we propose language-regularized matrix factorization (LRMF), which is regularized by the relationships between user programming language preferences. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the real-world dataset of GitHub. The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms five competitive baselines.","inCitations":["2655eb93ce8abfa026059c8dbe5b09c6b457a395","39b4d14b4e8c05afd0e13b7962cf9bf36a7be95e"],"pmid":"","title":"Open Source Repository Recommendation in Social Coding","journalPages":"1173-1176","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080753"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Code","Collaborative filtering","Experiment","Latent variable","Like button","Manifold regularization","Matrix regularization","Open-source software","Programming language","Recommender system","Social network","Software developer","Software repository"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7d213e1f0162b0b959965e6d38acb5aba32ff588","0fc2b637e260ac26d9288fe04cb352e428ea045c","52b7952dae51060c93ea34aa128044987efe8224","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","0aa2a4d259433016ebc899c496faea03c024c0bd","bd894d7c06cfe62461ae4518c540c8df9860fc69","e50f4d3316d13841c287dcdf5479d7820d593571","2bdcc4dbf14e13d33740531ea8954463ca7e68a2","1cf7ce28f64203d1f2dab1197a30722a608bcb7f","c8051eb6d177a470158400c36e0ddf57f87d9b90","19bb0dce99466077e9bc5a2ad4941607fc28b40c","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","4008d78a584102086f2641bcb0dab51aff0d353b","e3068a51016817c609acfd47adec6edcfb8bef90","3b866f9689514a4a1cb11d1d9d93446d6898ecf4","3eaca435527a765572ed04acd06ba512faac89eb","098c57f75479813c2cdc848ab16ef41d87353702","62dd02837c65b9c90de8d80c493f23ce1116cb3d"],"id":"a8fde4953ce112669d3602f63767d31f6238f923","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a8fde4953ce112669d3602f63767d31f6238f923","authors":[{"name":"Jyun-Yu Jiang","ids":["3165179"]},{"name":"Pu-Jen Cheng","ids":["1712392"]},{"name":"Wei Wang","ids":["47824598"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080753"}

Unlike static and dynamic pooling methods that are commonly used to compile relevance assessments for the creation of information retrieval test collections, Dynamic Sampling yields a statistical sample from which substantially unbiased estimates of effectiveness measures may be derived. In contrast to static sampling strategies, which make no use of relevance assessments, Dynamic Sampling is able to select documents from a much larger universe, yielding superior test collections for a given budget of relevance assessments. These assertions are supported by simulation studies using secondary data from the TREC 2017 Common Core Track.","inCitations":["6ce811af73ac243c7f6c6f744ba22745dd2564a8","09cc0def1c33c231523f7cfd88c18e911f903e8a"],"pmid":"","title":"Beyond Pooling","journalPages":"1169-1172","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210119"],"entities":["Application delivery network","Compiler","Elegant degradation","Heart rate variability","Information retrieval","Plug-in (computing)","Relevance feedback","Sampling (signal processing)","Simulation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["31ffafdcef68a1d0f3a030df8f03d5529420ce7e","3957369af4a66e6bbb7e5df4a90c309e251510b0","17963c800077aedd3802b3e97d45c286ba953ba4","4a516095f91364db4d0dea01e9c2576000dd7a02","d857f3c10634e1aaf2c59d7e506527f33d519f07","1b607341c7d1bb22ef2d3e565e6189d838bea6ed","5e351e47cc08f1944d8b8872b3c3a05fe1958f5c","abf32f0e80d1c91dbc5e1fc2dfd27720294eb30a","663768ac9c3f08b844736a2859eb0688a144f363","126240dedd75626fd736f0485d06f1f516517e54","0ac1d86fcd8825217e778457e425c143c434641a","9fcc3005da857a37d30939478f50cadb71f38f3e","5185297b4c2f0fcc00ec183b2dde1565fc963376"],"id":"2ed6ddc81762c27f21c17237dd7f6cef3064ae78","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ed6ddc81762c27f21c17237dd7f6cef3064ae78","authors":[{"name":"Gordon V.

Given the input keywords, in this paper, we study how to assemble a query graph that is to represent user's query intention accurately and efficiently. Based on the input keywords, we first obtain the elementary query graph building blocks, such as entity/class vertices and predicate edges. Then, we formally define the query graph assembly (QGA) problem. Unfortunately, we prove theoretically that QGA is a NP-complete problem. In order to solve that, we design some heuristic lower bounds and propose a bipartite graph matching-based best-first search algorithm. The algorithm's time complexity is O(k2l ... l3l), where l is the number of the keywords and k is a tunable parameter, i.e., the maximum number of candidate entity/class vertices and predicate edges allowed to match each keyword. Although QGA is intractable, both l and k are small in practice. Furthermore, the algorithm's time complexity does not depend on the RDF graph size, which guarantees the good scalability of our system in large RDF graphs. Experiments on DBpedia and Freebase confirm the superiority of our system on both effectiveness and efficiency.","inCitations":["0672984e36d95f198590db057b235b5c4fd5e33a","630a5b7f8b1060244b7eb79ddaf9a71b9b2caf64","04ab299e83470bccd72ad1ba7fc8a544c90bb969"],"pmid":"","title":"Keyword Search on RDF Graphs - A Query Graph Assembly Approach","journalPages":"227-236","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://tw.arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00205.pdf","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1704.00205","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132957","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00205v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00205","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00205v1.pdf"],"entities":["Best-first search","DBpedia","Entity\u2013relationship model","Freebase","Graph embedding","Heuristic","NP-completeness","Query language","Resource Description Framework","Scalability","Search algorithm","Time complexity","Two-phase locking","Vertex (geometry)","Vertex (graph theory)","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8c39c16e9140ad7f5e1e8949714bd3dbefd7147c","04cc04457e09e17897f9256c86b45b92d70a401f","122eda0ff026311fbb6e8d589262da0b9821c19f","c719eca361a854a69addd7f39537b7c412702eca","1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002","a9ecf2ae6b009e80ad5b4a9f81b116c2ee1face7","128d2482c0968cbd7639ecbe7dca97c11cf51570","1fe3833a07b81cf262f093b65ce05e95e870ab35","2c6fb1a7da3853b83bd851e1c061bda249694d67","68a33a3afac65eb6e0fb3726c1f9c8b727f32a42","3dc937b9c635d08d3428703f11cb0fc6270930b2","4d98e7aed4fce86e0ddd92bd4455b6f41fc4c780","3e950b7508a01cf55c89eb98473abb48e6355d08","7fc5860bfbe8f19894a91dd0bd0b6ac94f0e0fb6","cb4d277a51da6894fe5143013978567ef5f805c8","b52c1b64ba302460aad5dbb2e0ba239be55f5e38","3219fbcbe0f84e371b3266beb7678db567bd7c5a","881bfa5a7da16934dbabe925f976f0e9558d0085","6c3df010da893563360018e50c1503fdc0ea243f","1d85702101e7f638d01e22fd71a61b48c2b0c5c4","6099814c55861b15467d26010631124bea5dfbda","2a518e0b97e038e117b72aabd9f23f8ae2033da1","80c2d8c691b09f8b4e53f512b9d2641b49fda935","0e8e7455ce92703e4dd5413f68582a70be49b91b","96d7583eee4999fdcb7268d7b542ba9b32227c57","252eb1de8dce013d807519ba0089ec47f4e5147a","cc7b28949a3f083658ec467976a194bdafc33e96","10b13d1d7ce00845058a04fea59dc55f1db412d5","b162c99873c929447bb7ff48d454867aa83f375c","1ac3a1c91c982666ad63d082ffd3646b09817908","52f45d5c5ff273072d55008222d510cc14487a9a","09518167e8b1e01ae2583befd00fb56b0a7674e4","99c98f20c84bdbb614954b34202c96a9dee02ebc","8fd4f61732b68228ce37863efcf70f5f62a4376f","59a6fa9ef3841302aef0efb17d46579841b80031"],"id":"61848d0c3f856aa3559e1682faca1e17ce8051a5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/61848d0c3f856aa3559e1682faca1e17ce8051a5","authors":[{"name":"Shuo Han","ids":["3306893"]},{"name":"Lei Zou","ids":["38417991"]},{"name":"Jeffrey Xu Yu","ids":["1718849"]},{"name":"Dongyan Zhao","ids":["1791036"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132957"}

However, the performance of most existing review-based methods will degrade when the review is also sparse. To this end, we propose a method to exploit user-item p air-dependent features from a uxiliary r eviews written by l ike-minded users (PARL) to address such problem. That is, both the reviews written by the user and the reviews written for the item are incorporated to highlight the useful features covered by the auxiliary reviews. PARL not only alleviates the sparsity problem of reviews but also produce extra informative features to further improve the accuracy of rating prediction. More importantly, it is designed as a plug-and-play model which can be plugged into various deep recommender systems to improve recommendations provided by them. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PARL achieves better prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with the exploitation of auxiliary reviews, the performance of PARL is robust on datasets with different characteristics.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"PARL: Let Strangers Speak Out What You Like","journalPages":"677-686","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271695"],"entities":["Deep learning","Experiment","Information","Internet Key Exchange","Plug and play","Recommender system","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["89a16eb847e5039fe5d9c6372ab45145400c9aa1","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","4f6e61d2ab1e2f468cc4bc8fdd8d6f13efaba468","94a62f470aeea69af436e2dd0b54cd50eaaa4b23","47527f35481e3b16c64e3a27d46499f5efeca096","cd7f63705b45ef2f66e9b41462a36901450c9d51","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","2fac6c403631eaa1658e0405aed7980786a001ab","1ac7018b0935cdb5bf52b34d738b110e2ef0416a","1b8dc814a7384285a52bc005bc54a3b5c87b219d","0c953e630cccd64d2ad5fbb09f08425e7f82b7a3","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","3259270b232b23376e352a56707e5cb6e539fffd","cce60519321884c2722f590c459f92551915563e","4672f24bf1828452dc367669ab8a29f79834ad58","e2af314b238088588eebb94210535e31d5f647e1","e26a555e51c1af82c5c90f4c494775fd106bd419","c568902351e66c452fe1c729d4a25f6efeb433bb","9e91c370a8fae365c731947ad9178fb3788f6593","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","18cac5d010d7a1cf684e9f2bf177843fb8cd1893","0a5feab178ddb179a37f3a19b69b4a956ed797d8","4cfb3836273504f627c83b7f3810446c1c73921f","37b1ea5fb0ff024b6b49c43843efd77603390836","cc8d824ad7ee47f2d2f56b80125810519ea7f51e","4c3103164ae3d2e79c9e1d943d77b7dfdf609307","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","64c871cd7e0af7e1aeb94d98c6214eb8d8e8b989","db6389e0ca49ec0e4686e40604e7489cb4c0729d","2ef7d506b25731d0f3ec0c8f90b718b6e5bbd069","1000025264ef85af0b116b3c12d5b283504d36eb","0842636e2efd5a0c0f34ae88785af29612814e17","fbb65cf4be985f975285ea4e30ec02600b2ed125","064fb3a6f2666e17f6d411c0a731d56aae0a785e"],"id":"0bd648d4b0b23196330b9ab4913e22cecf764de9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0bd648d4b0b23196330b9ab4913e22cecf764de9","authors":[{"name":"Libing Wu","ids":["2309966"]},{"name":"Cong Quan","ids":["7241068"]},{"name":"Chenliang Li","ids":["2829009"]},{"name":"Dong-Hong Ji","ids":["1719916"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271695"}

Our approach extends the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with holographic composition to model the relationship between question and answer representations. As opposed to the neural tensor layer that has been adopted recently, the holographic composition provides the benefits of scalable and rich representational learning approach without incurring huge parameter costs. Overall, we present Holographic Dual LSTM (HD-LSTM), a unified architecture for both deep sentence modeling and semantic matching. Essentially, our model is trained end-to-end whereby the parameters of the LSTM are optimized in a way that best explains the correlation between question and answer representations. In addition, our proposed deep learning architecture requires no extensive feature engineering. Via extensive experiments, we show that HD-LSTM outperforms many other neural architectures on two popular benchmark QA datasets. Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of holographic composition over the neural tensor layer.","inCitations":["729fbc6664890c4e78cbcb2686a9b5e895255485","629feacc0f099f72618e7df7f48ee44f99c46f38","d66ad3628c11c45bde5d4b65b9c1109a95d364d4","ee789bb7ec336af222053cd26296f3de1ad3e021","c051cfabf26e75e4af2edfeec86f633a7d76590f","93abbbc59653383b022a00b2ad7e96a074d02d7b","06c65ffaabb7ef852560a6e5e32e73b9bfe85b9d","cc16d675c8643c6b918ef67dbd7e001d92a2d630","b072513aab92e64320dd6abccf132d79ccdefa70","c92403e2b6b1a9d4aa10d2ba0d87ad30cfa02153","84329a5ade32a3d98b03558c95c001c17e1740ae","90eba2ce1cea08315b48ba7e6169feae938bef5d","fab5828ac72c3cf10b55b5819296a65baa4aca32","a90179a880a34c70cb916133f931be7a97fec2d5","9e63233e36f70361c3fb00b2a2894951e7606852","cc76c27ad3f6d34df56fdadf86a5a53937ecd132","41a31fb17a9b1c5ee267dea43ee7e682bc07dae8","875c2faa2ec5b78174dc9fb2c4b02fda54391ebc","acb19932620452deab36b24a24b139f17224f469","5b8c127cd01ee237c45c2841ac78cd69b48a87c3","65134ea2f2fb484935fe7ede4a25adcf37513e30","e9595c4c99c0aa1fbd092d19813d984f39823494","28cd584dc5bbecd13a0b21b8996aee38ca938605","164b4c02957540a5901d5e4a43473ee88c745973"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning to Rank Question Answer Pairs with Holographic Dual LSTM Architecture","journalPages":"695-704","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080790","http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06372","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06372v1.pdf"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Deep learning","End-to-end principle","Experiment","Feature engineering","Holographic principle","Holography","Learning to rank","Long short-term memory","Scalability","Semantic matching"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3e393df4a5731fb7b49cf2f527fed1ee4e6e6942","22ae02d81c21cb90b0de071550cfb99e6a623e62","118be9cf31ecf5cbdd49a19da8615b593ec61a4c","07a9478e87a8304fc3267fa16e83e9f3bbd98b27","0ca50da53eaf9dc939e126a06975654f9531c600","8488adaa261f9a3be7e03acc2693ae4397b0eecd","5171157c2c09a85ad6558c5c03da6b75b0cf5fe6","a97bfc553687b021c48937f1d788dc38dc11c2e7","50d53cc562225549457cbc782546bfbe1ac6f0cf","03feca688989940fd4a5a13ac8837403b1af5e25","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","b44ff5104557fc9b900d48f02605dd42d794927d","a584211768d49f80192f13b8ed2fda9c058dec34","d2071c1e4a6030dc0005dbfeefdd196a8b293e84","564427596799f7967c91934966cd3c6bd31cb06d","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","bb75de5280ff9b0bbdd74633b9887d10fbe0ae10","828dbeb7cf922dc9b6657dd169b8d26d2b58eedb","2ad0f706990031a5955e7c641e351d1eb6ea0c93","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","a62b58c267fddfa06545a7fc63a3c62ef7dc9e15","7a9c4c98e361f3b4f4bfbeea7e6699917ce42091","d25595b82a8347be68317a74560b574583c3c2e0","0fd0e3854ee696148e978ec33d5c042554cd4d23","6812fb9ef1c2dad497684a9020d8292041a639ff","a27e243d2ef62644e7a2a1fa51878fe7dbca4479","e5d9bd94a65f3ed497a4d36e089b1393b0e5520d","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","507da0578b471650585fe948f9e8cd781800aeeb","65ad0e876216ea034b7958f016456e32666bc5c6","669441a336c4fb82dfd08c5b7e50b49f08bf869b","e3796f39fe2623823a5d48dee2822da9502561c5","0f32cd9cf29ec55b9a54dd5a4adf80b03e0ac08d"],"id":"4d0f00b4b8287c74f790f0156815471e6182fbaa","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4d0f00b4b8287c74f790f0156815471e6182fbaa","authors":[{"name":"Yi Tay","ids":["3665875"]},{"name":"Minh C.

What is not yet quantified is the extent to which search is a viable learning activity compared to instructor-designed learning. Can a search session be as effective as a lecture video - our instructor-designed learning artefact - or learning? To answer this question, we designed a user study that pits instructor-designed learning (a short high-quality video lecture as commonly found in online learning platforms) against three instances of search, specifically (i) single-user search, (ii) search as a support tool for instructor-designed learning, and, (iii) collaborative search. We measured the learning gains of 151 study participants in a vocabulary learning task and report three main results: (i) lecture video watching yields up to 24% higher learning gains than single-user search, (ii) collaborative search for learning does not lead to increased learning, and (iii) lecture video watching supported by search leads up to a 41% improvement in learning gains over instructor-designed learning without a subsequent search phase.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Contrasting Search as a Learning Activity with Instructor-designed Learning","journalPages":"167-176","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271676"],"entities":["Approximation","Crowdsourcing","Information needs","Iteration","Massive open online course","Multi-user","Overhead (computing)","Sensemaking","Session (web analytics)","Usability testing","Visual artifact","Vocabulary","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4c78c530cd487ad968bdd3fd22777265557d65b8","8e6d963a9c1115de61e7672c6d4c54c781b3e54d","076c02ff830cea9419bf754ed7c13e481b5287f1","7ad61fc906c1f0a265d05ee4c5d5df86423137da","5abca53c6c57f5264df6e40bb5ea2f09602bf506","b40567c71269c01c57330cce321d9147bc62a2e8","abbb22faa83910e0f087c217a5a7a84ce9bcc1eb","f99337c9029cd2176345b9eaf6205d858dc566e4","130d3dbf57a5765278b513c162f1485e236bded8","edfa3337e9b0d569562d49ad2b522adb835f567d","508dcdea7395bdcd3b7efddf0911c3c4dd2e53db","1879b9a9c17cc128c17eaffbd450d00d6a9422bd","7a43cdd0e8e4b628af6619812c73b2f2d524d0bb","040d8150b5c2e45819ddbe775d6d1425b789b8b8","1c5c6b62c3b3979b386439238daf3173b3349636","a3e075d194661568b6279ed82ac1641576ce9c4f","5364455d2acfbee1d30f04a5afdcd50c7247df31","0112b84829dc1d9d5a9f74fdca86cc6d16a14522","aaa6eb35637dd2ffffb2fa20d757387783f6895b","dea298b4ba2934a30955fc804c000750e0157ec4","ff6e08a116c2f623fb5de5a08e979b9a09fe24e3","8f815c565d8cf3561aa5b792966afd15f1486f7c","7d046e73f7e70935c33af9e32ea72905ed959d2e","26b19621449919b3576c549cd0717b09b2d5b4e7","124b952a755cb106a4ad56c09200a051e39eda64","31ab7c51219327f1b8489c4f3f6fe8f82470957e","19c87fd2b04438562959e2bdc488dedcb6aff21f","46cf276bdb27dd12c4c36f35855041e79e4ec981","7dce3168a17c8f359d651af8be2c20de9df368c1","47f5c59dc487cfbdf2264d31318b893e05a6ffe8","73e619e69f1e6ed31eeb879d480cbe5c1d69d151","7e72617e11d3a75c61960dfcdeb46bf0edbab5db","295f7cbf171ca702171aa01bd5df52b9fd9ba778","16baad515cd2ac25f095324d07e6ccb4079fc173","6335a1a0cf63b6411ab37eeafd0dcf920772bb0b","127eddae306dbb359eb3ea1d0aaf1b2fcd9ccfe7","6379c75c9ee3397ffd3c2ad1be8da3279140349f","d73b1e00d2a3dcf61d401664f346ee7d6328accb"],"id":"bed38665d8f565b91eafc2edd3b2c484fc7865bd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bed38665d8f565b91eafc2edd3b2c484fc7865bd","authors":[{"name":"Felipe Moraes","ids":["3445838"]},{"name":"Sindunuraga Rikarno Putra","ids":["50975029"]},{"name":"Claudia Hauff","ids":["2731925"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271676"}

There is a wide variety of crowdlearning sites in which, on the one hand, users learn from the knowledge that other users contribute to the site, and, on the other hand, knowledge is reviewed and curated by the same users using assessment measures such as upvotes or likes. In this paper, we present a probabilistic modeling framework of crowdlearning, which uncovers the evolution of a user's expertise over time by leveraging other users' assessments of her contributions. The model allows for both off-site and on-site learning and captures forgetting of knowledge. We then develop a scalable estimation method to fit the model parameters from millions of recorded learning and contributing events. We show the effectiveness of our model by tracing activity of ~25 thousand users in Stack Overflow over a 4.5 year period. We find that answers with high knowledge value are rare. Newbies and experts tend to acquire less knowledge than users in the middle range. Prolific learners tend to be also proficient contributors that post answers with high knowledge value.","inCitations":["8193584a3c4925b1e704dcca2a4c2eb533b80cad","3c527cd9e2c9602de5276c5890326bdeadb34890","1539ad035edd4c3b31f465d60302259355688a74","023a796ce6493df9bbf0c49fa25e39afe0e02611"],"pmid":"","title":"Uncovering the Dynamics of Crowdlearning and the Value of Knowledge","journalPages":"61-70","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04831v1.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018685","http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04831"],"entities":["Bayesian network","Citation network","Cluster analysis","Continuous signal","Google Questions and Answers","Isotonic regression","Like button","Massive open online course","Newbie","Off-site data protection","Online and offline","Provable security","Sampling (signal processing)","Scalability","Social media","Stack Exchange","Stack Overflow","Statistical model","Stochastic process","Time complexity","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["675c199a0444f95199ea19bf65d92fc3ff0c32fc","03d377997926a1aa20accfce82b774f22e8e7c51","235bc75dde38ec1d5bd0c30bd726893c08c5f58e","5ee0e0656af301131a6a4a945113d91cf60575ae","8e6d963a9c1115de61e7672c6d4c54c781b3e54d","5673410ff3cc98e85e2d63e197d1c62d13928d65","a885be7ee4c689b0d0d900ee2257918eb23ae728","7ce55da050ca4fd402d7535d1b52c404d328f02f","645b2c28c28bd28eaa187a2faafa5ec12bc12e3a","ea437380905a650648fab7b50d2685a3c36ecf2f","240f332a0cb2b76aa12b513e0b4afaee6de1fc6d","4a28f03e32e1d502deeeea170db9928a13fb870c","6767bf9737ea875009c793fab502e318e488e7c2","9588acb2634d7a19124d6012e0b4f1ea1c9736ea","55a51b86f6739f1d04556ffe0b69ae2d77a347b3","0d7c4a408b1bfedd0c19db92812fbee0515d564d","d5129a684ce5bc26ed8d9077fb5f314dff4fabbc","468db5a7ab875bb628da1acec0d0b5f0d7d4be45","5723ad50e635f9c8042cdf6b8a9fb5c0e2ff99a7","2dfe4aac9b60b3fbd1d29fd17439359baa0fb758","d8549e68043f12862074afb63b92747c772e2454","44e4fbf0d346c8d93ecbd9bcf8fb78741c143038","24ddf4770aadcdd8a96b613388ef2e571a7959de","3dcc3f512935bc3d7cb740b9941caa807bf5d6f4","2754a64445f67d388cd3c5f0e560b0f3d1d1c775","1b85fc57f252732ceb5b44a35fc5429d33fc81af","398dd8dcb4464a6fb8830868f6484476487d58e5","1076a9b8181a7f9eb069d38ca10876a3202d2e89","68636df9bdbfde0535f8d65a90a4bbcff4d743c7","f06e03db3b581d01dbfad69b82216d65dee5fb06","19c87fd2b04438562959e2bdc488dedcb6aff21f","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","073daaf4f6fa972d3bdee3c4e4510d21dc934dfb","e378f19748c17deab6b9d55497ff4cbac6133a74"],"id":"24d81dc3408ddcc97b1e0b70f32a6af86cdbea34","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24d81dc3408ddcc97b1e0b70f32a6af86cdbea34","authors":[{"name":"Utkarsh Upadhyay","ids":["10515643"]},{"name":"Isabel Valera","ids":["2123579"]},{"name":"Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez","ids":["1719959"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018685"}

We describe a framework that formalizes different ways of name-matching to determine which names could potentially refer to the same author. We focus on name variations that follow from specifying a name with different completeness (i.e. full first name or only initial). We extend this framework by a simple way to define traditional, new and custom blocking schemes. Then, we evaluate different old and new schemes in the Web of Science. In this context we define and compare a new type of blocking schemes. Based on these results, we discuss the question whether name-matching can be used in blocking evaluation as a replacement of annotated author identifiers. Finally, we argue that blocking can have a strong impact on the application and evaluation of author disambiguation.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"The Impact of Name-Matching and Blocking on Author Disambiguation","journalPages":"803-812","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271699"],"entities":["Blocking (computing)","Identifier","Name mangling","Web of Science","Word-sense disambiguation","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5ccbe579b0231fb4696209572149361473c4e3f6","152788a40a09cd5b9b979034df608a5cb3909f79","5d89a91098a3f64675f70bed10c7605330429786","92f1238a7015be5a2d6867be14e8e11f6132ec3c","f2e1f74e9a594cdaff27c54d62e99a62f4db8d7b","31cddb6a5a9bc2744fee9d4e2500c27789aca05d","221b59a2a6bc19302bac89abaf42c531f4dc4cf8","53239c94ce13dc4270cdeba6fed8f2bebacb56fa","2814594b81b6cb7e482121a10dd5ef973a283ae2","06505c29640c0ff6051c97e4f5bcc918d9ca78f7","b5487544d9e270847ed3db706f30316f4a286155","0b23dfcedbf6bda7f79b7ce3287a1e5cf4848d42","0f15f88b77c0f5fd015ca087074c45a89b702674","3c701a0fcf29817d3f22117b8b73993a4e0d303b","934d88b3fc74d041f8f1df4e2b5d0808d79a02df","ce39e354d923d6aba005269b6e3923e8b8d037a2","c2377725842d0b7a82df5edd99ccf95e3c56aa1d","96546febeb3b50fb1d748868dcc75fb931e48221","23d03e6d0dd605a7531c5a82f7a8235984ce9b2d","901fe3f8c7a42355a270bf653a749fd52b418f6e","d00acc8040de884aedb59b3d7a62b4cf20832790","257c3a63dfde06bbcfba12baa099d207cdad1a92","331dbf7d051cab2091164b6b9cb8b1cdf499feab","b0651b7857794392f0c19c3e8312ed2671c15d60","eda7f8ea8f15a958a330c76a8b704c2acf7dc2d4"],"id":"318a3428e9c0aa1d4ba29c99a99bb4a11d3e12ae","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/318a3428e9c0aa1d4ba29c99a99bb4a11d3e12ae","authors":[{"name":"Tobias Backes","ids":["31791535"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271699"}

We investigate the temporal characteristics of the social media activities of this protest movement, as well as the connectedness of the interactions of its participants.

In this paper we investigate whether these two sources of information can be used to complement and explain one another. In particular, we would like to know whether the logical relationships (a.k.a. semantic paths) which exist between pairs of known entities can help to explain the frequency with which those entities co-occur with one another in Twitter. To do this we train a ranking function over semantic paths between pairs of entities. The aim of the ranker is to identify the path that most likely explains why a particular pair of entities have appeared together in a particular tweet. We train the ranking model using a number of lexical, graph-embedding and popularity-based features over semantic paths containing a single intermediate entity and demonstrate the efficacy of the model for determining why pairs of entities occur together in tweets.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Using Knowledge Graphs to Explain Entity Co-occurrence in Twitter","journalPages":"2351-2354","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133161"],"entities":["Algorithm","DBpedia","Entity","Graph embedding","Knowledge Graph","Lexicon","Machine learning","Online and offline","Ordinal regression","Predicate (mathematical logic)","Ranking (information retrieval)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["427b168f490b56716f22b129ac93aba5425ea08f","844d502387a3996f167b04e2e83117c30c22e752","f67bbf81162b62c3ff9c8c1a93e2cec15cb98da6","e18307d7b9a41967ce3ab95b292c40052958f076","1001706abef21f51ecb52af4a13731c4d923674d","2b2c30dfd3968c5d9418bb2c14b2382d3ccc64b2","ae44aa56da6a05f1a4fed153afde088f043f924d","ad40e2f53f7112f4d2177df99fe5df47e2028541"],"id":"1f6014a1fb383991ab08a14e3a4f5ced5b664ecc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1f6014a1fb383991ab08a14e3a4f5ced5b664ecc","authors":[{"name":"Yiwei Wang","ids":["47906123"]},{"name":"Mark James Carman","ids":["2170598"]},{"name":"Yuan-Fang Li","ids":["4495301"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133161"}

Typically, online experiments last for several days or weeks and require a considerable portion of the search traffic. This restricts their usefulness and applicability.\n To alleviate the need for large sample sizes in A/B experiments, several approaches were proposed. Primarily, these approaches are based on increasing the sensitivity (informally, the ability to detect changes with less observations) of the evaluation metrics. Such sensitivity improvements are achieved by applying variance reduction methods, e.g. stratification and control covariates. However, the ability to learn sensitive metric combinations that (a) agree with the ground-truth metric, and (b) are more sensitive, was not explored in the A/B testing scenario.\n In this work, we aim to close this gap. We formulate the problem of finding a sensitive metric combination as a data-driven machine learning problem and propose two intuitive optimization approaches to address it. Next, we perform an extensive experimental study of our proposed approaches. In our experiments, we use a dataset of 118 A/B tests performed by Yandex and study eight state-of-the-art ground-truth user engagement metrics, including Sessions per User and Absence Time. Our results suggest that a considerable sensitivity improvements over the ground-truth metrics can be achieved by using our proposed approaches.","inCitations":["e6678ffbcbd186bc338a008259b9232c12b48b74","d750d8eb9a296e2e5d2429b91e8d0eb4ebd775a2","69b99fb8e6027829d5dfe4b426fcf6ea05def2c8","410cbc9c21c5402e1cc9604bc5d4e7cfa67725cc","268955e692c5af292eea7eb61b3e5f2c607ce11c"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning Sensitive Combinations of A/B Test Metrics","journalPages":"651-659","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018708"],"entities":["A/B testing","Emoticon","Evaluation function","Experiment","Ground truth","Machine learning","Mathematical optimization","Online search","Sensitivity and specificity","Variance reduction","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4a27ba1d46338030f0c3c8ae357aad5083bc7a87","08f7125bc2dd4ce529a2277ded9bc018fe120329","1cc6df40abb4074c48e49c70cba357fc4a7dfe63","25dff2141de660071f0a659182282e84092957c5","049ba16a73e4493c0d62db369e4f9a1c4820cbb2","3e43d731d638f769f12f8ab413d14a77a761856c","58b1bb1a1d33edd158069ac3bebf111f1fbc2d75","6ddc0dc940134c72ca355fafb78936a88f08927a","993d394fd5c63f9efa310fba938fba677141801c","1436dc6212bb88166bf6568ba56b81353485278e","19de70f33914d51686c40bda5399840f3c63129b","67f80240c59285146803d5dbff81f10047ffc288","6a937c588a68eb38ed49199832f2d626a6bdac3e","2167054da02b0bb2dddfccfa2c60866858478da2","abc853bd9a67dd87ebce025a7dc94fb467b067b9","8ca31559febf899ea7b2c9c97e6f73aada2154b9","30bfc350410a99d73a94a1d70f93c9d1ec30ba98","3e78c95053c9a84381a6253f2ba3b5cbbdb7ce7c","31d2a03109df110e5d5d5044837fcc30db404285","1835d78ec81b54507aae02b5ee1e2f2d8f56c14c","21697f9e4ced5f10ade4d785a8be936ca6e888d2","b063cc92f404b73324e2e6eab98191a6734d6ddd","ab0463d8aef96697ad0e4d2c86fd1b41ffd4633d","d597752a14123439794ebc50154fb49c4619ccb1","c586b2acb893ca918efc0ad8034b1f7af0b8e05c"],"id":"e1e088191cdac4f69e3b9672faffea07b0f6eb90","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1e088191cdac4f69e3b9672faffea07b0f6eb90","authors":[{"name":"Eugene Kharitonov","ids":["39555743"]},{"name":"Alexey Drutsa","ids":["1830047"]},{"name":"Pavel Serdyukov","ids":["1708801"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018708"}

Previous studies have been mostly focusing on external connections between nodes (i.e., topology structure) in the network whereas largely ignoring internal intricacies (i.e., local behavior) of each node. A pair of nodes without any interaction can still share similar internal behaviors. For example, in an enterprise information network, compromised computers controlled by the same intruder often demonstrate similar abnormal behaviors even if they do not connect with each other. In this paper, we study the problem of community detection in enterprise information networks, where large-scale internal events and external events coexist on each host. The discovered host communities, capturing behavioral affinity, can benefit many comparative analysis tasks such as host anomaly assessment. In particular, we propose a novel community detection framework to identify behavior-based host communities in enterprise information networks, purely based on large-scale heterogeneous event data. We continue proposing an efficient method for assessing host's anomaly level by leveraging the detected host communities. Experimental results on enterprise networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Behavior-based Community Detection: Application to Host Assessment In Enterprise Information Networks","journalPages":"1977-1985","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3272022"],"entities":["Affinity analysis","Anomaly detection","Behavioral pattern","Coexist (image)","Complex network","Computer","Mathematical optimization","Qualitative comparative analysis","Regular expression","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["25f25e7319f975e5279b71f23110491beb0a8bdc","27dd9201022d8a60ff18206fe524cc6611a06f2a","259da70238f076c670c6cc2901b82b3f20d472df","2fb36ecf864f40e84f2e50a5152107e16a03fb21","018d686bc93bf0c1216f1a7f8f16a2246b477829","07ad62b6b5da5f226c88549378886ca062e207a0","516a3b2554894e527b9f0bcecfbeae172635bab6","17b81a0599019406bf207284cce0ddafe9e0273f","72f6ac503cad5d6017348b501d0a81a565b2da4c","d15aef555481ed5cd59474e9e2efbc1ee37d5e94","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","a003ab6661c9d5eeb99a8a4941a840746165443c","26b99024682a897888428f727805967b032d0a54","393da513897cc819b195223b6407414da2fef023","1d6320a672b866444737880cee8a980f5cca6864","9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d","f16841e022038e94a59f7e0a82002102b78d79a4","17696b275ad1d44a48967246e3c064d16aa883e3","27f3c2b0bb917091f92e4161863ec3559452280f","6f1336cdbc0c6ef676c92dcd7126cfc28876791b","62bb7ce6ae6ed38f0ae4d304d56e8edfba1870d0","0f0809e6537e5ffe212190c243a249382f5ffab1","7139eb3d04007acf0e58fb4b31fcb150135df719","0250b5c0f7a414dec8c7a0aa7be20c9637eeb6ec","92e88c3096d586ad168132ec4d4e1c23699cc73b","12ed44db5ef8237d9c495cbedda5b1e30317ca4a","5da588c0278cd413fd2c4d5ebbcaed2a5118ac10","dab4f34814336e879411fbd303ca553b1e85e34b","71e5a6c95ff476c303c3adeae0c1a4387485f733","41285e207f2bfb861d3aee7c1557a9b8525745af","7c9f6ab015c596e53f0fe0a86afd5a57a8347d31","e77122e5fd2b9591ddc16c5bbcbd6b1bb41e6209","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8"],"id":"ff933dc9e8034a9d2cd5462ee62f506bb4fd5180","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff933dc9e8034a9d2cd5462ee62f506bb4fd5180","authors":[{"name":"Cheng Cao","ids":["49831143"]},{"name":"Zhengzhang Chen","ids":["1766853"]},{"name":"James Caverlee","ids":["1697232"]},{"name":"Lu An Tang","ids":["1712190"]},{"name":"Chen Luo","ids":["50649434"]},{"name":"Zhichun Li","ids":["1745122"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3272022"}

People are willing to share their selfies in various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Flicker. The popularity of selfie have caught researchers\u2019 attention, especially psychologists. In computer vision and machine learning areas, little attention has been paid to this phenomenon as a valuable data source. In this paper, we focus on exploring the deeper personal patterns behind people\u2019s different kinds of selfie-posting behaviours. We develop this work based on a dataset of WeChat, one of the most extensively used instant messaging platform in China. In particular, we first propose an unsupervised approach to classify the images posted by users. Based on the classification result, we construct three types of user-level features that reflect user preference, activity and posting habit. Based on these features, for a series of selfie related tasks, we build classifiers that can accurately predict two sets of users with opposite selfie-posting behaviours. We have found that people\u2019s interest, activity and posting habit have a great influence on their selfie-posting behaviours. Taking selfie frequency as an example, the classification accuracy between selfie-posting addict and nonaddict can reach 89.36%. We also prove that using user\u2019s image information to predict these behaviours achieve better performance than using text information. More importantly, for each set of users with a specific selfie-posting behaviour, we extract and visualize significant personal patterns about them. In addition, to concisely construct the relation between personal pattern and selfie-posting behaviour, we cluster users and extract their high-level attributes, revealing the correlation between these attributes and users\u2019 selfie-posting behaviours. In the end, we demonstrate that users\u2019 selfie-posting behaviour, as a good predictor, could predict their different preferences toward these high-level attributes accurately. c ©2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.

We find that K-NRM has low variance on relevance-based metrics across experimental trials. In spite of this low variance in overall performance, different trials produce different document rankings for individual queries. The main source of variance in our experiments was found to be different latent matching patterns captured by K-NRM. In the IR-customized word embeddings learned by K-NRM, the query-document word pairs follow two different matching patterns that are equally effective, but align word pairs differently in the embedding space. The different latent matching patterns enable a simple yet effective approach to construct ensemble rankers, which improve K-NRM's effectiveness and generalization abilities.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Consistency and Variation in Kernel Neural Ranking Model","journalPages":"961-964","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210107","http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10522","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/Papers/sigir18-Mary-Arpita-Pyreddy.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10522v1.pdf"],"entities":["Align (company)","Artificial neural network","Consistency model","Converge","Convex function","Ensemble forecasting","Experiment","Kernel (operating system)","Pattern matching","Relevance","Software deployment","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["38dda1e89bab926fa643d3f4739e1b5fbb454e77","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","ba1ea662bce87e8a44d85932354b8bcdba1ecc2f","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","0aedae19e94d76520cb92932b6506389799051e2","ea738439b880ad033ff01602ea52d04b366d0d37","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","4cc823c48ac40cdef13465ebb0f2795659a357ec"],"id":"84d17c02bb92acf39f81e319886f6bfe57756c92","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/84d17c02bb92acf39f81e319886f6bfe57756c92","authors":[{"name":"Mary Arpita Pyreddy","ids":["51007384"]},{"name":"Varshini Ramaseshan","ids":["3367815"]},{"name":"Narendra Nath Joshi","ids":["50745535"]},{"name":"Zhuyun Dai","ids":["2475437"]},{"name":"Chenyan Xiong","ids":["3264651"]},{"name":"James P.

Most existing approaches use shallow models and only work on static networks by extracting local or global topology information of each node as the algorithm input. It is challenging for such approaches to learn a desirable node representation on incomplete graphs with a large number of missing links or on dynamic graphs with new nodes joining in. It is even challenging for them to deeply fuse other types of data such as node properties into the learning process to help better represent the nodes with insufficient links. In this paper, we for the first time study the problem of network embedding on incomplete networks. We propose a Multi-View Correlation-learning based Deep Network Embedding method named MVC-DNE to incorporate both the network structure and the node properties for more effectively and efficiently perform network embedding on incomplete networks. Specifically, we consider the topology structure of the network and the node properties as two correlated views. The insight is that the learned representation vector of a node should reflect its characteristics in both views. Under a multi-view correlation learning based deep autoencoder framework, the structure view and property view embeddings are integrated and mutually reinforced through both self-view and cross-view learning. As MVC-DNE can learn a representation mapping function, it can directly generate the representation vectors for the new nodes without retraining the model. Thus it is especially more efficient than previous methods. Empirically, we evaluate MVC-DNE over three real network datasets on two data mining applications, and the results demonstrate that MVC-DNE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":["df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","b0e2ff4fe0dc5c58cd20ba875826e5bcb15d5afb","4f938616f65a8fec534e7782a53a9426a3bd3c90","c1edc6dc088b8860bfb440822c8e2fc769e9970e"],"pmid":"","title":"From Properties to Links: Deep Network Embedding on Incomplete Graphs","journalPages":"367-376","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132975"],"entities":["Algorithm","Autoencoder","Data mining","Deep learning","Global optimization","Model\u2013view\u2013controller","Time and motion study"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27208c88f07a1ffe97760c12be08fad3ab68fee2","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","0026402e608d2d212e571536cd1d160b310ed0d8","50681b5f3666bc730986263fde588c5000e93874","b7b00080f83e5b65a10bb07c0a7091e746c3a57e","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","0ce8879ea7fc0e96fd0e4e242a46002010f86e18","1871ea4cf23441d0297c99d9115f664a6ba0efda","87c8eccb221db9f33fdf9c8a6a17498e18045b4a","26742aa25a2790558f840b9551fb1babc4f9e03a","71b64035eacf2986ca7c153ebec72eb781a23931","d3e0d596efd9d19b93d357565a68dfa925dce2bb","d54b45bb99699021cac4b770eded6e80105a2ef6","75d663b9d6a492b4c5a466f9ba2dfa06fc450d6e","fc60f2e1147d754911334f4ba88ce9d92a535990","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","20739c96ed44ccfdc5352ea38e1a2a15137363f4","1eb6538c7fa6a41923869924a55c95036f06c9a0","c2fd72cb2a77941e655b5d949d0d59b01e173c3b","745782902e97be8fbacd1e05d283f11104e2fec6","2bf3fb9d50a39ad727f248ffd4b14f07a2d48e4a","d0b7c8828f0fca4dd901674e8fb5bd464a187664","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","11540131eae85b2e11d53df7f1360eeb6476e7f4","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef"],"id":"f428b0bfec203194c7473e7d83a8e50b222417dd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f428b0bfec203194c7473e7d83a8e50b222417dd","authors":[{"name":"Dejian Yang","ids":["9716975"]},{"name":"Senzhang Wang","ids":["3210262"]},{"name":"Chaozhuo Li","ids":["2869810"]},{"name":"Xiaoming Zhang","ids":["46447760"]},{"name":"Zhoujun Li","ids":["1707275"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132975"}

We evaluated the adequateness of two major multileaving methods, team draft multileaving (TDM) and optimized multileaving (OM), proposing their practical implementation for live services. Our experimental results demonstrated that multileaving methods could precisely evaluate the effectiveness of five rankings with different quality by using clicks from real users. Moreover, we concluded that OM is more efficient than TDM by observing that most of the evaluation results with OM converged after showing multileaved rankings around 40,000 times and an in-depth analysis of their characteristics.","inCitations":["7ef76ca82490e3f8db87d128c35db00b35938bf6","b5ff01429106da0c70cc29d2b9648f0a78573e59"],"pmid":"","title":"A Comparative Live Evaluation of Multileaving Methods on a Commercial cQA Search","journalPages":"949-952","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080687"],"entities":["Forward error correction","Question answering","Toad Data Modeler","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27f7e9ff722cad915ba228dce80aa51d883c8e9f","505253630ab7e8f35e26e27904bd3c8faea3c5ce","67f80240c59285146803d5dbff81f10047ffc288","3630af46b507fe6c42856c7ec77e1b0af3c5b7d6","8a9f5e61c6c977cdacd85d9a7b14153026619505","ab0463d8aef96697ad0e4d2c86fd1b41ffd4633d","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","36e5365654531d4ec19e8194b9f80d7bbd5ad294","5199dab867277dc1b63193f7f8a3086c8c31c412"],"id":"4a55a3f1f55062d0696d9df793402641e57d609c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4a55a3f1f55062d0696d9df793402641e57d609c","authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Manabe","ids":["2708735"]},{"name":"Akiomi Nishida","ids":["32517301"]},{"name":"Makoto P.

Using a purpose-built test collection, we find that these methods are able to generate high-quality suggestion candidates.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Generating High-Quality Query Suggestion Candidates for Task-Based Search","journalPages":"625-631","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b92b/1c3686ea6bd18f42b65df204db9471f4fa41.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07997v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_54","http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07997"],"entities":["Crowdsourcing","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["816749906e5e608c0d7df1b799088dc047cd85e2","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","8e95526a02d6ddbadd11612baed19c78f504915b","5f01c737ff21a42bcec48a6383f86842d73e9fc3","cd0d291729cab9256afe737e29a05866dd2c737b","15156983f24dea8777f772587625e82af30901aa","032f8a405020e6ddc8a99cf5b7c7290672b270cc","00f31994c123fbceba5d5a0e06bb78aff651aae7","1b1df9f75ee6f27433687dad302387f811dab64d","a1072952cdb3a6fe2959f13bfd7c07e4f80584ce","30fd857fc874e587f0c653d5b1853d7fa0d4b490"],"id":"b92b1c3686ea6bd18f42b65df204db9471f4fa41","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b92b1c3686ea6bd18f42b65df204db9471f4fa41","authors":[{"name":"Heng Ding","ids":["3312795"]},{"name":"Shuo Zhang","ids":["47180808"]},{"name":"Darío Garigliotti","ids":["3359600"]},{"name":"Krisztian Balog","ids":["1680484"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_54"}

However, building systems that provide such recommendations presents a major challenge due to a massive pool of items, a large number of users, and requirements for recommendations to be responsive to user actions and generated on demand in real-time. Here we present Pixie, a scalable graph-based real-time recommender system that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. Given a set of user-specific pins as a query, Pixie selects in real-time from billions of possible pins those that are most related to the query. To generate recommendations, we develop Pixie Random Walk algorithm that utilizes the Pinterest object graph of 3 billion nodes and 17 billion edges. Experiments show that recommendations provided by Pixie lead up to 50% higher user engagement when compared to the previous Hadoop-based production system. Furthermore, we develop a graph pruning strategy at that leads to an additional 58% improvement in recommendations. Last, we discuss system aspects of Pixie, where a single server executes 1,200 recommendation requests per second with 60 millisecond latency. Today, systems backed by Pixie contribute to more than 80% of all user engagement on Pinterest.","inCitations":["2f0f52bcac2d2de4e41ee4f6d721643689ce5a18","1eea762d568fef4910ad447000d41112081b5afc","9a821d673e4fbd536f8a322e6ecab8d4ffd7cc57","26f2171833e0fe0987abbc5cc46176d8f2706518","a38a0ad9492212fa7bafae90e2dc3bd986f90c27","08f4534aebda9483ff5f8102b495c1fb59e353a6","53383efb32a39d470f0cd3776ff8716d26ef0bd8","c89cf808e892110bf40e4a3d7d1d8a3272aba288","6c96c2d4a3fbd572fef2d59cb856521ee1746789","d6935806a422b9e6b7b8a9971920d86579b5f2e1"],"pmid":"","title":"Pixie: A System for Recommending 3+ Billion Items to 200+ Million Users in Real-Time","journalPages":"1775-1784","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/758a/1fef436fd6a0e06eaf1033a4604bbca0a277.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07601","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186183","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07601v1.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07601","http://www.zitaoliu.com/download/www2018.pdf","https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/pixie-www18.pdf"],"entities":["A/B testing","Algorithm","Apache Hadoop","Distributed computing","Experiment","Object graph","Online and offline","Personalization","Pixie","Production system (computer science)","Real-time clock","Real-time transcription","Recommender system","Requirement","Scalability","Server (computing)","Software propagation","User experience","Web server"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6837376dfa71e17f2a8513b48ddbfc80b5af488c","68b8e2f79e8e0b4f674cdbc9bfc2afbde5e94c8e","71fbbc1675780f2f945073f9d92c09b8d76f80f0","33da83b54410af11d0cd18fd07c74e1a99f67e84","59e914c920497dd931f1b5fe7151f071d80713de","10aa9ee7caaf9381b6a0468ae899a9729824a6b7","1d60ae6720118273b02fd60b54c27441e17e719a","4f9df283f1dac228fbbd3efd50765ecb317efe6c","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","9eb55f9a6aff2a70415cba21a23a538ee46a36fe","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","ad2d98dfc590505550c98d6fc850164031dbb8c3","29efbdf3f95cee97405accafdebd3bd374f1f003","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","760948698540118031e590fbc884fcea209f9104","0ace72127a00b51623e44ec368121a8ef676410f","0842636e2efd5a0c0f34ae88785af29612814e17","e7d53f538f5239739d1f943c81d17e4a167c65c6","1dd8db60043f51c04eb7200915ebd253d2fabf64","0cba3aa5b8702c6eea0f2b435b3368db0888a664","31af4b8793e93fd35e89569ccd663ae8777f0072","098c57f75479813c2cdc848ab16ef41d87353702","641c06b56c9676950b86bb74a658c6a8a198722b","657fbf29ea0b4904a3e98d1556f9acf38dddae5f","52a5f494f15846837dbbbbb6f29832e82dc0e22b","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","714544b7cf35a3b8bdc12fb1967624a38f257a42","1fe2fde9d7db7b7d5f4881e90f0e7fc54e1b4534","1606f7d2634e593d617ee67985fbdd9915bd7190"],"id":"b120a10310645df329c691b782dea9ceb7dfe786","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b120a10310645df329c691b782dea9ceb7dfe786","authors":[{"name":"Chantat Eksombatchai","ids":["2311320"]},{"name":"Pranav Jindal","ids":["50435146"]},{"name":"Jerry Zitao Liu","ids":["46701374"]},{"name":"Yuchen Liu","ids":["49421529"]},{"name":"Rahul Sharma","ids":["37529085"]},{"name":"Charles Sugnet","ids":["48909843"]},{"name":"Mark Ulrich","ids":["22903003"]},{"name":"Jure Leskovec","ids":["1702139"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186183"}

However, dealing with the increasing sparseness of user-item matrix still remains a challenge. To tackle such issue, hybrid CF such as combining with content based filtering and leveraging side information of users and items has been extensively studied to enhance performance. However, most of these approaches depend on hand-crafted feature engineering, which is usually noise-prone and biased by different feature extraction and selection schemes. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model by generalizing contractive auto-encoder paradigm into matrix factorization framework with good scalability and computational efficiency, which jointly models content information as representations of effectiveness and compactness, and leverage implicit user feedback to make accurate recommendations.

If we understand digital cities as exploration of cyber space and smart cities as exploitation of physical space, the next stage is to evolve networked society based on cyber physical systems. The current movements suggest two different directions, socialization of commerce and commercialization of society. We can predict the convergence of the two directions in the future.","inCitations":["cb9f1c9f80df0434df82a956a3c0817ff3416780","1ca12cb033866f065b77655f635d5b7c3a9db365","32462ddeb54392b42d497255edf4af9c4c19d624"],"pmid":"","title":"Digital City, Smart City and Beyond","journalPages":"1151-1152","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7a4/fc7958f2f2fa7f05933b59fe793ec18a5f35.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054710","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1151.pdf"],"entities":["Cyberspace","Networked Society","Smart city","Socialization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5bc255158609f61aa603e0445742b800cbc72d18","28307c06e1bfb0a393a66c6f6cd08bb3d839fdde","13e24a51fe8a706e731f2f83c581786032399044","e872c2f1c38a408061170d6536062cea5cd14579","342fd9e7e9c54851f5976c8dbc9e05627b3d3968","bccf79aca81fa54a7419bf57ad3bfcc82f6ef526","3575373a7b27eeccac7580b93d775fcda58aa17b","cbecec2c904a7743bc8ed78dc0adeb492d397712"],"id":"d7a4fc7958f2f2fa7f05933b59fe793ec18a5f35","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d7a4fc7958f2f2fa7f05933b59fe793ec18a5f35","authors":[{"name":"Toru Ishida","ids":["1709883"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054710"}

To achieve it, traditionally formal reporting systems like VAERS support accurate but delayed surveillance, while recently social media have been mined for timely but noisy observations. Utilizing the complementary strengths of these two domains to boost the detection performance looks good but cannot be effectively achieved by existing methods due to significant differences between their data characteristics, including: 1) formal language v.s. informal language, 2) single-message per user v.s. multi-messages per user, and 3) one class v.s. binary class. In this paper, we propose a novel generic framework named Multi-instance Domain Adaptation (MIDA) to maximize the synergy between these two domains in the vaccine adverse event detection task for social media users. Specifically, we propose a generalized Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion to measure the semantic distances between the heterogeneous messages from these two domains in their shared latent semantic space. Then these message-level generalized MMD distances are synthesized by newly proposed mixed instance kernels to user-level distances. We finally minimize the distances between the samples of the partially-matched classes from these two domains. In order to solve the non-convex optimization problem, an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm combined with the Convex-Concave Procedure (CCP) is developed to optimize parameters accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our model outperformed the baselines by a large margin under six metrics. Case studies showed that formal reports and extracted adverse-relevant tweets by MIDA shared a similarity of keyword and description patterns.","inCitations":["ed304dc6ef7bbd3d5329da4cbdeb2b6d033c8fc4","273663a7cbed2c8a805a74155ae71fae66f66df4"],"pmid":"","title":"Multi-instance Domain Adaptation for Vaccine Adverse Event Detection","journalPages":"97-106","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5cdd/65d1103c8d931c2d03838fe76df7fd020590.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186051","http://mason.gmu.edu/~lzhao9/materials/papers/p97-wang.pdf?__acm__=1524721160_190edd2b66be32f05b7e56a9cd52e42e&acc=OPEN&id=3186051&ip=46.218.74.72&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35.6D218144511F3437"],"entities":["Algorithm","Augmented Lagrangian method","Baseline (configuration management)","Concave function","Convex optimization","Description logic","Discrepancy function","Domain adaptation","Experiment","Formal language","Mathematical optimization","MikuMikuDance","MinEd","Optimization problem","Resource Description Framework","Social media","Synergy","User space"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["49b32eabe38a895ef23732f1b58d30f9a5aac5db","e84c1f93cf99de23426d4d7d9dc55ada674e816a","77078e4905ceb68000ceaf226a358b18233cfc01","3447fe054f6af70403cfc39b4d21076337a71128","1c7d38f68fe1150895a186e30b60c02dd89a676a","32d225ce6a9c2545489f1e8ed42f83c165e63a61","64c28b5ccf844606b9bc6db41da2c50ff27ef820","0d3ffeb6ca97af08fd4e294c01c7df16b2215a38","02eed03bdf0c5f9c8ad1f2a9dfc9fc8d8e6c817e","007b87d74009b0cc1397417bc9aa834f3e200e82","19cf71fec04208f7bf52940b16faba72f398c0fe","0dcdb8815e85f575144a8877c130e73034ab092a","d6c11104c6461c256ba8ccc1460a7e42d7a3a6ce","bcf48b5e76c7e22335c6820f0de0abe8c5f708b5","26806ebc713d52fc3ddeede1ed8dd68e92c7c8cd","17fcf3a7a9b2ca7c457a9d12364e15a4d88e1a43","70c4b1045816cf82d88f207c715c29cd2eb50ab0","4b7c8063892ca57131bd71b9c839d970ee8b0226","6ea5b7a5fcb28168e6f35ae6f0255b7262d1f2be","1189cbd45a18305b92eabb64cb8704ea8ee7b638","5f47dff76174f0a0cda429e2ed0e733b4026ddea","3041cc61935c7c59382a0c6488aeba42950e1bbb","90abbe1f2f78493b9a596ba13b7145a07e50df84","0faec5d63edcb91d04f0a74fd60dc4b4ccb73357","15131cc4a4c5012fecaa5ac784a4d0d96a0b6d92","a25fbcbbae1e8f79c4360d26aa11a3abf1a11972","1124bf29316266fc304b21b520f1e14800431295","c2b5d8487e124de49204220bbd7b5b9519cddc55","64372501affd8571db20dc606b0146a76c266303","2069c9389df8bb29b7fedf2c2ccfe7aaf82b2832","077ef373d33952ac1a03ce34758c68ebf3ed4abc","17facd6efab9d3be8b1681bb2c1c677b2cb02628","ab5de6c13f2ded6eeb366c2f139f6bd462f50b5e","c40c51edbbcb5ffb8e301deaf0c695f1cb4ee203","7e51514e97df2cb256d264a8901f56a371f55c4a","a48b11e619f45d297fd1b5cbc81c796398b815fc","326ea5654d78e0fbd4284d5ada9965dc208e6db7","0ca63fe8a6ebc7217b4fd37034c75046bf78df94"],"id":"5cdd65d1103c8d931c2d03838fe76df7fd020590","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5cdd65d1103c8d931c2d03838fe76df7fd020590","authors":[{"name":"Junxiang Wang","ids":["4142921"]},{"name":"Liang Zhao","ids":["39164176"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186051"}

Our instantiation of Online EM for click models is orders of magnitude more efficient than retraining the model from scratch using standard EM, while loosing little in quality. To deal with outdated click information, we propose a variant of online EM called EM with Forgetting, which surpasses the performance of complete retraining while being as efficient as Online EM.","inCitations":["abaabf0e77d9dbe5a333b80d21844be34c53c540"],"pmid":"","title":"Online Expectation-Maximization for Click Models","journalPages":"2195-2198","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133053"],"entities":["Clickstream","Expectation\u2013maximization algorithm","Experiment","Forge","Interaction","Linear algebra","Universal instantiation","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["724906c7bec24f14fb5798b4588bf9508a86521b","07e1bd116a23225bdf9ffefaba015311b92c28ad","055370f1e989a8a726058073dad8dd64866b8882","226966243877f186d346be01047cf71cee1b5ec4","b7a31cf3af58106b024515a40f8975da5c5f0527","4752e8858dd67002b16b281e115655307ec3c974","2d4a55711b7c80468f64b13999a7cc1467357052","03d32a2614dcb64b81d3b7181e7e4559be5de9fc","7f31d5d291ec63999eec1b619280abdec9d2ba3e","77cba94ab304b82ede59ae32b7ed1ea90d2ad7c7","4aa55e8035efe51c972f64318e67c3c0fa4b72d2","bd73ec7bac51a332e5833bb1a02bcd3bf7a79474","10ceb668f84860bb09fca364125cae4b1ee2e760","4e08017cd0da3cfec22d97987e87c8e0c7f1f5a2","ba1ea662bce87e8a44d85932354b8bcdba1ecc2f"],"id":"7af9a736962218f6287758b8b00ecf2f21abd286","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7af9a736962218f6287758b8b00ecf2f21abd286","authors":[{"name":"Ilya Markov","ids":["39998805"]},{"name":"Alexey Borisov","ids":["47497274"]},{"name":"Maarten de Rijke","ids":["1696030"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133053"}

In this paper, we propose an innovative and novel conceptualization of scholarly plagiarism in the form of reuse of explicit citation sentences in scientific research articles. Note that while full-text plagiarism is an indicator of a gross-level behavior, copying of citation sentences is a more nuanced micro-scale phenomenon observed even for well-known researchers. The current work poses several interesting questions and attempts to answer them by empirically investigating a large bibliographic text dataset from computer science containing millions of lines of citation sentences. In particular, we report evidences of massive copying behavior. We also present several striking real examples throughout the paper to showcase widespread adoption of this undesirable practice. In contrast to the popular perception, we find that copying tendency increases as an author matures. The copying behavior is reported to exist in all fields of computer science; however, the theoretical fields indicate more copying than the applied fields.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Citation Sentence Reuse Behavior of Scientists: A Case Study on Massive Bibliographic Text Dataset of Computer Science","journalPages":"1-4","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3200371","http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02499","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02499v1.pdf"],"entities":["Computation","Computer science","Conceptualization (information science)","Cosine similarity","Wiki","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6e80f768a72eb6352580aeebd0aaec5d34d5c95c","7903d62d97676610f9205e83975b3ebcc2a0ea99","f30a59f4b18d24c21f7ac939059cfb80859b76f4","2c05373896be0d7c88bf1a28161356cb77f42acc","688f104fab24e8ea0eb114f923d4f998bd702b1d","5ee1ddcf1b1084391d5c418a149059cd73685981","46f766c11df69808453e14c900bcb3f4e081fcae","7ea4bfbd551c039df7164f808fda6adb203619a3","1ad3d4cb8a2e656a70fd1307fa79919a1f749b90","1cf7c90d461346343cae1d831f4f7b8654229b4b","e3eda2b4c134817c928b6b8816eb73fdb5f8bc32"],"id":"c59230cf5acbcad9c94f1faf00c5483afd6471e2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c59230cf5acbcad9c94f1faf00c5483afd6471e2","authors":[{"name":"Mayank Singh","ids":["49851416"]},{"name":"Abhishek Niranjan","ids":["48233886"]},{"name":"Divyansh Gupta","ids":["15560852"]},{"name":"Nikhil Angad Bakshi","ids":["9403299"]},{"name":"Animesh Mukherjee","ids":["33392067"]},{"name":"Pawan Goyal","ids":["1722563"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JCDL.2017.7991589"}

We hypothesize that search and retrieval based techniques are sub-optimal for learning complex relation likes provenance. State-of-the-art information retrieval techniques using term frequency inverted document frequency (TF-IDF) to capture surface level closeness along with different textual similarity features for semantic closeness are insufficient to capture implied and entailed provenance with less surface-level similarity. In our comparative studies, we find that the provenance is relative i.e. something makes a better provenance than other based on certain linguistic cue or key information being more prominently conveyed, and hence we model the problem as pairwiseranking and not simple ranking or classification. To capture above points we propose a joint scoring approach weighting surface level closeness and learned semantic relation. We use TF-IDF and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for the syntactic score and pairwise neural network ranking model to calculate semantic relatedness score. For citation-provenance facet classification, we retrofit the same neural network architecture on identified provenance, with the removed pairwise ranking component.","inCitations":["89b31ca94d35e98f1c0c0bb0b0ae37a229bd5134","6a948d6d6f8ee219e76e70a2774fb08f30fa2495","e4f5b6993fab42e288df3c4c86f7ef24f885eec7"],"pmid":"","title":"WING-NUS at CL-SciSumm 2017: Learning from Syntactic and Semantic Similarity for Citation Contextualization","journalPages":"26-32","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5ae7/bd6013615fe410b9436e312084da303c7f1f.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2002/nusclscisumm2017.pdf","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~animesh/resources/w2.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Automatic summarization","Centrality","Computation","Information retrieval","Longest common subsequence problem","Network architecture","Ontology components","Semantic similarity","Tf\u2013idf","Wing-shape optimization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8c1ce10cec4b2eac9cc9fd2961642d8206d90d9d","b075cc14bfefb39a903f2e41dbbe717b41a82304","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","2e092e48e4ebac3925a1643254b72a90289c8d8b"],"id":"5ae7bd6013615fe410b9436e312084da303c7f1f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5ae7bd6013615fe410b9436e312084da303c7f1f","authors":[{"name":"Animesh Prasad","ids":["40172901"]}],"doi":""}

This gap is one of the main challenges in integrating recent advances in clinical research with day-to-day practice. Thus, the need for clinical decision support (CDS) search systems that can retrieve highly relevant medical literature given a clinical note describing a patient has emerged. However, clinical notes are inherently noisy, thus not being fit to be used as queries as-is. In this work, we present a convolutional neural model aimed at improving clinical notes representation, making them suitable for document retrieval.

However, changing systems and data curation practices have created opportunities in which unified grant and publication data can help us to better understand the research lifecycle. More, specifically, the indexing of funding acknowledgements by bibliographic databases has become an established practice, and provides a means for programmatically building links to connect award records to publication data. This work illustrates the enrichment of grant award records from the U.S. National Science Foundation with direct links to publication data extracted from Web of Science. The usefulness of the bridged data is demonstrated through computation of acknowledgement lag, defined as the time elapsed between when a grant is awarded and when an article is published which acknowledges support from that grant. The application of a categorization schema furthermore shows that research disciplines are very different in terms of the lag time between awards and publications. Furthermore, the results found that in some cases, awards continued to be acknowledged by publications decades later.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Methods for Synthesis of Funding Agency & Publisher Data","journalPages":"57-63","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3127526.3127537"],"entities":["Bibliographic database","Categorization","Computation","Data curation","Database schema","Digital curation","Gene Ontology Term Enrichment","Information system","Web of Science"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"9be4b579754f5a7dec4bd11038a4110d824a1660","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9be4b579754f5a7dec4bd11038a4110d824a1660","authors":[{"name":"Monica Ihli","ids":["2867216"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3127526.3127537"}

Neural networks, on the other hand, have proven track records in many supervised learning tasks. In this work, we propose a training framework with a graph-regularised objective, namely Neural Graph Machines, that can combine the power of neural networks and label propagation. This work generalises previous literature on graph-augmented training of neural networks, enabling it to be applied to multiple neural architectures (Feed-forward NNs, CNNs and LSTM RNNs) and a wide range of graphs. The new objective allows the neural networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data by: (a)~allowing the network to train using labeled data as in the supervised setting, (b)~biasing the network to learn similar hidden representations for neighboring nodes on a graph, in the same vein as label propagation. Such architectures with the proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent and scaled to large graphs, with a runtime that is linear in the number of edges. The proposed joint training approach convincingly outperforms many existing methods on a wide range of tasks (multi-label classification on social graphs, news categorization, document classification and semantic intent classification), with multiple forms of graph inputs (including graphs with and without node-level features) and using different types of neural networks.","inCitations":["2a05cb8677128664a80e1b225125e31d8cc91cc9"],"pmid":"","title":"Neural Graph Learning: Training Neural Networks Using Graphs","journalPages":"64-71","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46568.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159731"],"entities":["Adjacency matrix","Baseline (configuration management)","Categorization","Converge","Directed graph","Document classification","Domain-specific language","Graph (discrete mathematics)","Linear classifier","Long short-term memory","Loss function","Mathematical optimization","Multi-label classification","Nested Grid Model","Neural Networks","Neural network software","Optimization problem","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Social graph","Software propagation","Stochastic gradient descent","Supervised learning","Teaching method"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7a1005c76e948d892b6c56392aeee71d49c5db11","58513e5043c8a8fb61dbe83ab58225e7f60575af","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","02485a373142312c354b79552b3d326913eaf86d","1762baa638866a13dcc6d146fd5a49b36cbd9c30","1379cc1e4a0fab44ff4ead7a0b065eae78d5f4e3","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","b8828871ce4c5f4a3d202da4461383bbbf46a7cf","081651b38ff7533550a3adfc1c00da333a8fe86c","e5f24e3a5a03367c49707f243ebbf9f38d994340","19bb0dce99466077e9bc5a2ad4941607fc28b40c","15b2c44b3868a1055850846161aaca59083e0529","5c3785bc4dc07d7e77deef7e90973bdeeea760a5","17accbdd4aa3f9fad6af322bc3d7f4d5b648d9cd","798d9840d2439a0e5d47bcf5d164aa46d5e7dc26","7b8833ee8d9a78f9bf0696527ac68c5e5d957fb7","26742aa25a2790558f840b9551fb1babc4f9e03a","321514a76a09d7a6fca00d27eda92663236c0f66","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","2e10643c3759f97b673ff8c297778c0b6c20032b","3d1d94a075498f86f4b6bcad7cb4037e82ab50d3"],"id":"a1843e32e53ce550235217cb3dd26850b8cf68ed","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a1843e32e53ce550235217cb3dd26850b8cf68ed","authors":[{"name":"Thang D.

No clear dominance is seen between measures based on textual similarity and graph proximity. Some of the better measures involve expensive global graph computations. We then propose a new, space-efficient, computationally lightweight, two-stage framework for relatedness computation. In the first stage, a small weighted subgraph is dynamically grown around the two query entities; in the second stage, relatedness is derived based on computations on this subgraph. Our system shows better agreement with human judgment than existing proposals both on the new dataset and on an established one. We also plug our relatedness algorithm into a state-of-the-art entity linker and observe an increase in its accuracy and robustness.","inCitations":["22271c9955e6cb5677ecc5d47cb2607e9d65c29f","a56220eb81473e5c22c14b51e7fd19a30cc0a4d9","b8ecb40fa55095f530cc5ff173103584b02b9a89","f921c248caeb5a8a55b45d970221ceb08e18c67a","9da5efd9e5529d75d210d9b6180672100d086158","e610969fee30fcbe02bf9efb6133eb1baccaa1a5"],"pmid":"","title":"A Two-Stage Framework for Computing Entity Relatedness in Wikipedia","journalPages":"1867-1876","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132890"],"entities":["Algorithm","Computation","Entity","Knowledge Graph","Link-richness","Wikidata","Wikipedia","YAGO","lsh"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["01fcc1df1c1b90745f5721125931ba4ed052fe3b","2bb1df67e235015d867bc2d3fdbf12028976a299","4e9c459390caef1eb116c1f2fcbe7e79717f2964","51ea20dc4f688af41f9840a854d15bac49db1be6","6beb7a83c762f1f6796e602f71191ceef95027ff","51b5cecc3881f1608ce53c4229682f55e1787fa6","1c909ac1c331c0c246a88da047cbdcca9ec9b7e7","7801fdb0aa7db9301c7363f7cd68b43f97adafef","1efadc9e77a4c5dc30bd53d3123657052a6b8f85","241d682c29574ea2462fe9ec8f7f80cbf2f537ea","15fcecf899acf594ebb7b04ba2df49aa4adc4799","0e2bdc45c08acef3cabfd9a41bad4f79099c5166","0b9dea9414a3acbd5d00e00541f917f96be68e19","3baecc04e1341cbae7999e8f61a3946c76504828","009dbf3187862352aac542bf7d61e27bce6b27f5","9b36aacc8434fcf82c998d83e050e253407ca4b2","05dbe031b635ab9572eed4ef88d8b0311a48b48e","08b4efb97d98f4e66d8872899661f31ea58664da","32ade8977c64862c7a442a45c86b76897e68bd39","0b40daf5f449b883f6637ff9ce0add94b4cd5af1","1c799eca7983c62f7815ac5f41787b3e552567b6","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","36a181c75ecf77be863cea34adb21398fadd7b5f","3a7210732592a60ee1ec9ab259c77b5bb4197142","a432ac0f9c43290882d8954d222889e4f2421f0d","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","81f8706abcecfc748f2e27d6f7a92628036d6846","157aef34d39c85d6576028f29df1ea4c6480a979","0483f11717096a27648de7ee73780db3233bf306","110f729addefa9de072e80cbcf68e034ed3c0116","12f7b71324ee8e1796a9ef07af05b66674fe6af0","7c56100bd4b89735bf9332b79c12e54d9368e9ac","340b893c8a2adc7b937b418b1eb7411df8907345","0f0141cfd1bc89f8ed78a91d4894ade576056571","18e594b429161646ccd5b93b893384587ccaf8e1","96c697be387566a0637941fc7492fcfc25ad56bb"],"id":"4a0e3a03f98ba40418db4e5263d982966f9db9c9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4a0e3a03f98ba40418db4e5263d982966f9db9c9","authors":[{"name":"Marco Ponza","ids":["17277125"]},{"name":"Paolo Ferragina","ids":["1681278"]},{"name":"Soumen Chakrabarti","ids":["2197703"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132890"}

Their ability to learn new features directly from the data, however, may come at a price. Without any special supervision, these models learn relationships that may hold only in the domain from which the training data is sampled, and generalize poorly to domains not observed during training. We study the effectiveness of adversarial learning as a cross domain regularizer in the context of the ranking task. We use an adversarial discriminator and train our neural ranking model on a small set of domains. The discriminator provides a negative feedback signal to discourage the model from learning domain specific representations. Our experiments show consistently better performance on held out domains in the presence of the adversarial discriminator---sometimes up to 30% on precision$@1$.","inCitations":["f72fbae1db618dbcaccefdd29618ea498a268487"],"pmid":"","title":"Cross Domain Regularization for Neural Ranking Models using Adversarial Learning","journalPages":"1025-1028","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03403","https://people.cs.umass.edu/~dcohen/data/sigir_adversarial.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03403","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210141","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03403v1.pdf"],"entities":["Authorization","Discriminator","Experiment","Feature learning","Hoc (programming language)","Information retrieval","Learning to rank","Machine learning","Matrix regularization","Negative feedback","Ranking (information retrieval)","Sampling (signal processing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3842ee1e0fdfeff936b5c49973ff21adfaaf3929","0fc13f366f9324d25a1dfa67b1d3e24d8750a297","ac392dba43796a25c2eee5f08671537634a77029","234dc7984668f72ee4917755915040386be4eb1f","1c734a14c2325cb76783ca0431862c7f04a69268","e03cf7e3d3a026910fd6485dcb9927e957378071","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","17742bbb3f911aae17afee384fa7379fa92a6aa4","0f9535512a9bc8414f86a2774b5e4d8b35a5036b","88fbf478fd5d0baa2c1d5cc6d0b7daea38893a89","6de2b1058c5b717878cce4e7e50d3a372cc4aaa6","107010b7f2abe3c0c9df62bcef35eb77f6fc76df","787a505cce232736cab9a236044bd3f3e4f0dffc","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","24b4746688c15c8580d1000d4f4ac63f5eb79561","007e86cb55f0ba0415a7764a1e9f9566c1e8784b"],"id":"5ae5971d000b2be9c4cd883ca59a2f26af07887a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5ae5971d000b2be9c4cd883ca59a2f26af07887a","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Cohen","ids":["2219145"]},{"name":"Bhaskar Mitra","ids":["33636244"]},{"name":"Katja Hofmann","ids":["2308803"]},{"name":"W.

The presented approach identifies contiguous anomalous periods, rather than daily spikes or drops, and allows anomalies to be ranked according to deviation from expected behaviour. The developed method is implemented as a running tool, with outputs published daily by mailing list. This list highlights per-country anomalous Tor usage, and produces a daily ranking of countries according to the level of detected anomalous behaviour. This list has been active since August 2016, and is in use by a number of individuals, academics, and NGOs as an early warning system for potential censorship events. We focus on Tor, however the presented approach is more generally applicable to usage data of other services, both individually and in combination. We demonstrate that combining multiple data sources allows more specific identification of likely Tor blocking events. We demonstrate the our approach in comparison to existing anomaly detection tools, and against both known historical internet censorship events and synthetic datasets. Finally, we detail a number of significant recent anomalous events and behaviours identified by our tool.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"On Identifying Anomalies in Tor Usage with Applications in Detecting Internet Censorship","journalPages":"87-96","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05819v2.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201093","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1507.05819","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05819v3.pdf"],"entities":["Anomaly detection","Blocking (computing)","Functional reactive programming","Synthetic intelligence","Telecommunications network","The Daily WTF","Tor Messenger","Usage data"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5935f52caf1df059ed9e301ad1fbfbd8d01bfa18","4c7a5b7d4067721079789156f4fa692934885334","0202932220cee4d2f557729f72a4f73832433f64","048270c9194a1c708db22b25d8b433d34bd2875f","766e33d87a1719d877ffdeb9250aa53629a13177","86652a3ceb904cc144e1bafa423f6f558d045593","99936d25456570f1d3565b221b9eb0f682e715fa","0195d819d26355e714007d8a4bce04d0700312ed","7ea39e0ee9ef3d0e1c9f0f88f898893985c9099a","568c44678d2bba4ae9d735b555e847437a7e6f15","4ed253eb8200983537d80d9b158a9559e9c3e09f","b8d9b3b17ce498dc981ce231d78e4162deaf2d59","6544febe6e96bfa1acc755e99bcadabecfc103bc","3e0a272f5d102f21a3849db243d93c62d0ba28b8","3d4eb1d210e73ec806062db2d0fad844932d9d49","0b9bc78999b1c7caf70da614beeb784d661b5785","1a1b25efe423c7c864dcee8d5d33ab52e217aa14","1a29dd17b602bbbb487285fc6aa5fa2bb9bf8649","77eeb3832252feae78900cc398b37d6f409c535a","246310099609c87cacec2ce27ad2cf4228d95ef8","e046f0bf4cca7228c648d3864a4843634ac37165","9a0f19a0ed810360a76a8565b229ab7940e2c83d"],"id":"3f3fa1d516ecf5d0c37ad6265aed0043b0e077cd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3f3fa1d516ecf5d0c37ad6265aed0043b0e077cd","authors":[{"name":"Joss Wright","ids":["25856187"]},{"name":"Alexander Darer","ids":["3314015"]},{"name":"Oliver Farnan","ids":["1961697"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201093"}

Despite being user-centric, these applications are usually supported by services running on servers that mediate all interactions among clients. When users are in close vicinity of each other, relying on a centralized infrastructure for mediating user interactions leads to unnecessarily high latency while hampering fault-tolerance and scalability. In this paper, we propose to extend user-centric Internet services with peer-to-peer interactions. We have designed a framework named Legion that enables client web applications to securely replicate data from servers, and synchronize these replicas directly among them. Legion allows for client-side modules, that we dub adapters, to leverage existing web platforms for storing data and to assist in Legion operation. Using these adapters, legacy applications accessing directly the web platforms can co-exist with new applications that use our framework, while accessing the same shared objects. Our experimental evaluation shows that, besides supporting direct client interactions, even when disconnected from the servers, Legion provides lower latency for update propagation with decreased network traffic for servers.","inCitations":["35e477facc2f665aa6a15181ec315111080915f1","008440c1a8ff78a0700baaf6b66dfa58cdb4a102","a36c0427e8011471577795b6973a7d7ea689ae3e","3e8e8c8d4b6c1f69c65571a37ae23ab7f395e3b0"],"pmid":"","title":"Legion: Enriching Internet Services with Peer-to-Peer Interactions","journalPages":"283-292","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f5b3/b66d093a648c7659613598063cca1aa4e3d5.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p283.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3038912.3052673"],"entities":["Centralized computing","Client-side","Fault tolerance","Interaction","Jamie Wilkinson","Legion (software)","Multi-user","Network traffic control","Peer-to-peer","Scalability","Self-replicating machine","Server (computing)","Social network","Software propagation","Web application","Web service"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["57c5e4a35be218ad0133ec9a353ac80b82ea0557","20c450f099b661c5a2dff3f348773a0d1af1b09b","e51c05a01ea2d3de34e5b0a6542715c2f6261165","5619c61ac036cfcde641ff6e1ce882f0e00f5acb","259a11bb2ccac5af9128b00c2bd0237c3f712d3c","08c3532ede4089a290e114dfa0e7d29ccac9c1bb","823113494a216ed988593663e2e912e503dffc68","cdee1c49685a1e66b040b6c8381ce6e85f643f3a","d71aa12462d5b9c275823e216d98abf609ef0ffc","abcc7b8089fc547e20216fc42b8ac8cc45e2c428","057672d39d94cb8cda7d1131c857657b6085ab69","4b79c844bb854c11ab18981591e4d2ea01f29539","cd39f11ac1aa0d16db569e47e08760efd648f4b0","7043d6846189822618c3e9bfe8882339ecffcefb","c097593d353a4b93728b730b6074b52824395cfb","1f97e3043492aaf461c3520e53a9f493837c43d2","34d269619576cd827b9842581755c06dac344b16","c0a2a62fa4d9f9b75a1df9f7cf5daac19de897b2","369c52d8214b73a86b1e3f31d287823ea91884d6","028a39ab00878e4537199c4f3c8075067d6f22e0","65776abca3a9ead1ea72702e5b2f3334c48b884d","cb06fb6c57a1591169931012dea71bde3f1c0516","09d1a6f5a50a8c3e066fb05a8833bc00663ada0e","5dd350cee6ecfd097b57772f89e6341ff05b5725","06e04a7a24100dbc0f72f22bc8e6dde4b2a27d8b","75971593df6a447a075a671a3438d976f6414384","34cadf38d973a5fb17bd90d11260c07e86c90b33","00d672a400675825f6458aa33d6813fcaa1b4eba","14da75882596e90bc76a19835129de4f7b4b7fe7","7b9f0330d698580902d4ecd65b0dc1d86d78d345","7e8348f39f019817d4cf5389111974bc0e31245f"],"id":"f5b3b66d093a648c7659613598063cca1aa4e3d5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f5b3b66d093a648c7659613598063cca1aa4e3d5","authors":[{"name":"Albert van der Linde","ids":["3413212"]},{"name":"Pedro Fouto","ids":["10023697"]},{"name":"João Leitão","ids":["1966672"]},{"name":"Nuno M.

We place particular emphasis on ordinances and tweets relating to Smart City Characteristics (SCCs), since an important aim of our work is to assess how well a given region heads towards a Smart City. We rely on SCCs as a nexus between a seemingly infinite number of ordinances and tweets to be able to map them, and also to facilitate SCC-based opinion mining later for providing feedback to urban agencies based on public reactions. Common sense knowledge is harnessed in our approach to reflect human judgment in mapping. This paper presents our research in ordinance and tweet mapping with SCCs, including the proposed mapping approach, our initial experiments, related discussion, and future work emerging therein. To the best of our knowledge, ours is among the first works to conduct mining on ordinances and tweets for Smart Cities.

The learned embeddings could advance various learning tasks such as node classification, network clustering, and link prediction. Most, if not all, of the existing works, are overwhelmingly performed in the context of plain and static networks. Nonetheless, in reality, network structure often evolves over time with addition/deletion of links and nodes. Also, a vast majority of real-world networks are associated with a rich set of node attributes, and their attribute values are also naturally changing, with the emerging of new content patterns and the fading of old content patterns. These changing characteristics motivate us to seek an effective embedding representation to capture network and attribute evolving patterns, which is of fundamental importance for learning in a dynamic environment. To our best knowledge, we are the first to tackle this problem with the following two challenges: (1) the inherently correlated network and node attributes could be noisy and incomplete, it necessitates a robust consensus representation to capture their individual properties and correlations; (2) the embedding learning needs to be performed in an online fashion to adapt to the changes accordingly. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel dynamic attributed network embedding framework - DANE. In particular, DANE first provides an offline method for a consensus embedding and then leverages matrix perturbation theory to maintain the freshness of the end embedding results in an online manner. We perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real attributed networks to corroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.","inCitations":["25c4c49d197a7a2026fcbe0884d6ea00cf1b84f4","4d26762fe26da6e06919a3b66e0f29429867d9f0","75d772f93fb0a75b88cd776bd2c8682dbea7d6fe","58badc691d4cfe0c3eb1a7244527c2fafcff6d56","35bf55da8dc909a659276978aa6cb3ddd5086f43","827665540549435d90ea7d214ab0c11e5ab8f652","2f92a268e176cda6dd98ef74f351fca2735e3462","dab0855680270065724720833be65cb5ee87ab01","f5c8d8a356848d83fa8a3d9711db8752088d4aac","963aacf5cc4753985c03de69150f9fb4e929ca5a","df04d4c6de810a9ab64769c5ad6f46cf4e1c8119","b9417d287d6d9cc34c5d65c5380ccca1e76ec63d","bbe4dcda681969bcc91677e36b7f1af8f2e354df","57116f1ff221cdb81a2c3a25e21ad92c82162c66","f3854f531f002dfd4e7327240adb696c52795009","9a821d673e4fbd536f8a322e6ecab8d4ffd7cc57","d3f63363219b55f2823ae4c1abbb1dd246042843","96a3dc5169c095c154fc873d6655903618336448","7c97b2313ecd174f5a89a1831f38b3e6272e4ab1","02521fc62f1203911c67d1b314d97b9af7263ab5","60718ff912b372afb048e9d93eba450ed6b6d715","e54042f7e3235b5a7842ae854aa273e21ee2cc62","cc80bef57ea3a60809bbdcf4b46b823d6e77dda7","7a186b52649d5d1792b7f863dab928451fc2e2ac","bb8a5fe720c9e2f6fb6797d3ad3f99c0971d200b","b2f42ff4aab525892d51b0f2698aba29c54c11b5","b0e2ff4fe0dc5c58cd20ba875826e5bcb15d5afb","72e11a831915cc028e33dbf45044a8bc3283fe3c","1eea762d568fef4910ad447000d41112081b5afc","ead806cd66cdf48dc6fc0f336ca7b6715460cd2b","149f9475116182c74bab66047aca0797f7bb93fc","7c28b81dff1899e5a148ff57888faacc9945ab22","8168b2653606966230055c82de6e7b5abcb59bb0","f6e6867dbe4951d247d63f4128e4a1e1c3cd7ca8","5322603e6619d07b904359ff8dc6a31d0b5d71b4","157d849543c28dd80aadf4d7d5ab3a2d1583e2e7","9b0eccbee8a21a00c5d4f484a15a32ea49ad323a","a949cc2ee57366532fb757e7264afef47688a58f","df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","5a22d85726b678fbb829d070fc73fe2a9bb91310","55adc5c0da06ebe9d0e6eb327c175a5e8f065abc","3f850199d2264cace0d1d77d7e27c07faefbb7e7","97f1d08c306040401112ff0564f37e6c6a312522","1f9fada6b0f2a15fd1dc3e9c77220f6800ef989c"],"pmid":"","title":"Attributed

The former method does not account for the sequential nature of news reading and suffers from the problem of cold-start, while the latter, suffers from over-specialization. In order to address these issues for news recommendation we propose a Hybrid Recurrent Attention Machine (HRAM). HRAM consists of two components. The first component utilizes a neural network for matrix factorization. While in the second component, we first learn the distributed representation of each news article. We then use the historical data of the user in a sequential manner and feed it to an attention-based recurrent layer. Finally, we concatenate the outputs from both these components and use further hidden layers in order to make predictions. In this way, we harness the information present in the user reading history and boost it with the information available through collaborative filtering for providing better news recommendations. Extensive experiments over two real-world datasets show that the proposed model provides significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"HRAM: A Hybrid Recurrent Attention Machine for News Recommendation","journalPages":"1619-1622","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269311"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Cold start","Collaborative filtering","Concatenation","Experiment","Partial template specialization","Recommender system","User profile"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6cd49dd5d26d1e8e33891f8e64ad3b5012e90ba6","2285c262bc459b5ad96b2e16ccb755a44dc5f918","2eb32b1a4c5bf741632a9fd5f852253fd0d53def","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","6c02053805434162e0fed26e1d5e035eb1071249","4f6e61d2ab1e2f468cc4bc8fdd8d6f13efaba468","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","794f63b0ddbd78156913272a7f4275366bbd24e4","5262fe8369992259be27165ccd09d1d31c7a4def","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","3b0c39b323a8cc1a90b3fdee83dad2fd417bd0ce","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","8db26a22942404bd435909a16bb3a50cd67b4318","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","7656cddac460af91919558175063938acfdd813b"],"id":"a53269781e66ff6d9d4464d0e1234681a1cba66b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a53269781e66ff6d9d4464d0e1234681a1cba66b","authors":[{"name":"Dhruv Khattar","ids":["2319272"]},{"name":"Vaibhav Kumar","ids":["40021586"]},{"name":"Vasudeva Varma","ids":["1704709"]},{"name":"Manish Gupta","ids":["29960724"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269311"}

Interactive information retrieval researchers have become more interested in studying the user behavior in academic search engines in order to improve ranking and to better understand the user expectations. In our previous work, we analyzed the user behavior towards Marcia Bates\u2019 search stratagems such as \u2019footnote chasing\u2019, \u2019citation search\u2019, \u2019keyword search\u2019 and \u2019author search\u2019. In this paper, we propose to examine in more detail the user behavior towards journal paper search known as the \u2019journal run\u2019 stratagem. We study the frequency and the stage of \u2019journal run\u2019 use in a social sciences academic search engine log. We found that the journal run is mostly used at the end of retrieval sessions and has an approximate usefulness of 55% measured by the presence of positive user actions in the log. Moreover, we include typical journal metrics in our case study and test whether there is an influence of the journals\u2019 impact factor (IF) and coreness of a journal on the overall session conduct. We found that the metric IF and coreness of a journal do not have a measurable impact on the journals utilization of social sciences users.","inCitations":["80696067eed3ff6a9077e5a72f82e269dc48357d","0fd73a27351243d19088c169d156a77782e5a667","b1c7973da855104235d8399952640dcf4fc2c3ed"],"pmid":"","title":"Users are not Influenced by High Impact and Core Journals while Searching","journalPages":"63-75","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88df/fe5fbf3b3a661b44c5436e6b6855e4f0b0b2.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2080/paper7.pdf"],"entities":["Academic Search","Approximation algorithm","Citation index","Digital library","German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence","Information needs","Information retrieval","Interaction","Interactivity","List of academic databases and search engines","Log analysis","Usability testing","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["038a6cb07ce09035e8c52488dedea564215e9cd2","30c544d74f2ce5a53ead96597fdaddfe1039a134","e512db68bfbc19f9e4e1f94bc8dd53d65718d152","aadfc6a9d59981a0c2d3e07f69ee7cb244201831","b177771fe70a9495daa8b51aaced6de28bb38530","e9a09ecf7aa83d3735a1504c633f1ddb06366bac","fd027a42f2a40e644dbf7e15aa451de132ec6618","2d11bbd8f7d50868998a0aa6d882e4a1584935e0","cbbed313efdaa3af3fe9e7001fdf9ff4d595f5cc","5afdae300484667ee38db6d727f2d0b7f0e622a4","dff3cb04786c9833fb3dd2514f923deb2532326e","0c68fefbed415a76cf7b87c2e8cefaf8695b3b8c","45fb576c9a817272e1ae7a2f4727d74f276861a6","39623b1ad36d80a31677b5d0502406a97949b539","5a3b9e5a58db18b6956ac38509b8d7008469d865","fff9ee4b54e4b066d62235cd7eeafcf6278bd618","1cbe14e94ef17bdcb36e81433bbd26b55125b5f4","7dc3834a3256dbb56439093c45a51c26cf0d18ee","0f331061a374ec003026680ee1d8ed507e0e7a0d"],"id":"88dffe5fbf3b3a661b44c5436e6b6855e4f0b0b2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/88dffe5fbf3b3a661b44c5436e6b6855e4f0b0b2","authors":[{"name":"Ameni Kacem","ids":["37592450"]},{"name":"Philipp Mayr","ids":["1729725"]}],"doi":""}

Some EDs usually form a group where they wirelessly communicate with each other. Different ED groups are interconnected by optical fiber cables. Through coordinating the use of ED groups, we can perform a collaborative edge computing in a hybrid network where a cost-efficient opticalwireless convergence is achieved by virtualization. In this paper, we use the virtual network to describe one computingapplication\u2019s requirement for the substrate resource, and we investigate how embed multiple virtual networks onto the common network infrastructure. In our approach, a graphcutting algorithm is firstly utilized to embed as many virtual networks as possible onto the specified EDs within the same group. However, a single ED group cannot handle all computing applications competing for limited wireless and computing resources. To solve this challenging problem, we transform the virtual networks\u2014impossibly embedded onto the same ED group\u2014into new ones processed by ED groups. Simulations results demonstrate the green feature of our solution: 1) the total transmitting power assigned for EDs is effectively reduced using the graph cutting algorithm provided that all of computing applications can be solved by a single ED group; 2) our method accepts more virtual networks with the improvement ratio of 77%, through the coordination of ED groups. In addition, there is a good match between the algorithm result and the optimal number of consumed wavelengths per optical fiber cable.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Green Virtual Network Embedding for Collaborative Edge Computing in Environment-Friendly Optical-Wireless Networks","journalPages":"1531-1536","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1531.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054768"],"entities":["Algorithm","Computer simulation","Cost efficiency","Edge computing","Edge device","Embedded system","Optical fiber cable","Transmitter"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1dc6470ca8d584547024e7f36e3fe915bb87d351","500c38a3dab293b327a4461c7d90b155947d4b65","6282c3783c4dd4d9c2987b7d9122b3216e6cb6d1","3149e65ebd8f3c0bbab410c8c0733a00a842cde4","bf35617e049e37ebf70800e12f8fb54720d3157d","46f5191b14227377b9564c424658af8b59fa6b49","7dec5bfa594cebd5578d4da2b1a7ce1dbc8e6f89"],"id":"0294dabbd6c72a0d661396db8dd11ab2aad35e18","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0294dabbd6c72a0d661396db8dd11ab2aad35e18","authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxue Gong","ids":["2912517"]},{"name":"Lei Guo","ids":["40270988"]},{"name":"Zhaolong Ning","ids":["34506974"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054768"}

In this tutorial, we cover the many sophisticated approaches that complete and correct knowledge graphs. We organize this exploration into two main classes of models. The first include probabilistic logical frameworks that use graphical models, random walks, or statistical rule mining to construct knowledge graphs. The second class of models includes latent space models such as matrix and tensor factorization and neural networks. We conclude the tutorial with a critical comparison of techniques and results.

One of the reasons the World Wide Web is so successful is the fact that most content is available free of any charge. Inspired by the success of the World Wide Web, the Web of Data applies the same strategy of interlinking to data. To this point, most of data in the Web of Data is also free of charge. The fact that the data is freely available raises the question of financing these services, however. As we will discuss in this paper, advertisement and donations cannot easily be applied to this new setting. To create incentives to subsidize data providers, we propose that sponsors should pay the providers to promote sponsored data. In return, sponsored data will be privileged over non-sponsored data. Since it is not possible to enforce a certain ordering on the data the user will receive, we propose to split up the data into different batches and deliver these batches with different delays. In this way, we can privilege sponsored data without withholding any non-sponsored data from the user. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a delayed-answer auction, where sponsors can pay to prioritize their data. We introduce a new model which captures the particular situation when a user access data in the Web of Data. We show how the weighted Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism can be applied to our scenario and we discuss how certain parameters can influence the nature of our auction. With our new concept, we build a first step to a free yet financial sustainable Web of Data.

Embedding representation models make use of local information available in immediately surrounding words to project nearby context words closer in the embedding space. With rising multi-tasking nature of web search sessions, users often try to accomplish different tasks in a single search session. Consequently, the search context gets polluted with queries from different unrelated tasks which renders the context heterogeneous. In this work, we hypothesize that task information provides better context for IR systems to learn from. We propose a novel task context embedding architecture to learn representation of queries in low-dimensional space by leveraging their task context information from historical search logs using neural embedding models. In addition to qualitative analysis, we empirically demonstrate the benefit of leveraging task context to learn query representations.","inCitations":["43642a638cae87af650f9acf65eb75d6b1f4a733","162bb08c42b4e6ad5e4ae11cff021ebf7f8d3bd5"],"pmid":"","title":"Task Embeddings: Learning Query Embeddings using Task Context","journalPages":"2199-2202","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.rishabhmehrotra.com/CIKM17-taskEmbeddings.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133098"],"entities":["Computer multitasking","Information retrieval","Personalization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Session (web analytics)","Web search engine","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a29a2aa3ce86e770f8857824003e3fb055d87990","2f14e3b459dc78868851c372ae00a74519c3e1f4","3dd3e986fda5541a039239c8b5c705b030ecc73f","26ed19606a57d837b4b9dcc984ff61763cdd0d36","8478c0f46dd30ef7f4052145983d6d315c2e1f17","25494a7e6244a61d47f6e7da8ac8221eb92f1089","72de8805ee27bb37767b8709ad3c9767a9a097ea","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","07a02c6cdf6fabff13fe42f5309bf55c91a087fb","0ddc065cc92046857d35555c3af4ade1310aca4a","a153c6924f483fff0b4f31d6dbb6fa174bcf7355","c76ebcdb807a40d194c76e18484700d70c59b214","2a738a4ea894874b408533f3d7452f1e1e1b1ef2","8b40b159c2316dbea297a301a9c561b1d9873c4a","3a9793acf40c10021648dcadb3d32818b8181500","816749906e5e608c0d7df1b799088dc047cd85e2","836bd587051482b75f924679995a403449b61f3a","e09c5d29d6a6668dbdb5326236285eb8d07f64b2","1ff1e7bbae2da8791cb3e17ffa3b842a1f762891","214adc2dfdc2160cdf5be54001daf2b2304a03b3","2e42bf8747363161851dc04b85aedb1ada50daaf","2ed164a624809c4dc339f973a7e12c8dc847da47","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","25ff4e83ca020fb5764e7544262ea3ab53269adc"],"id":"a395217bcb95019d94f5eb92cad00688dcdd6bd3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a395217bcb95019d94f5eb92cad00688dcdd6bd3","authors":[{"name":"Rishabh Mehrotra","ids":["39718171"]},{"name":"Emine Yılmaz","ids":["35466594"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133098"}

Such straightforward fusion strategy can benefit the classification and information retrieval tasks. However, it may introduce noise in case the high-level features are not naturally common hence non-fusable for different modalities. Intuitively, each modality may have its own specific features and corresponding representation capabilities thus should not be simply fused. Therefore, it is more reasonable to fuse only the common features and represent the multimodal data by both the fused features and the modality-specific features. To distinguish common features from modal-specific features is a challenging task for traditional DBN models where all features are crudely mixed. This paper proposes the Common-Specific Multimodal Deep Belief Network (CSDBN) to solve the problem. CS-DBN automatically separates common features from modal-specific features and fuses only the common ones for data representation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CS-DBN for classification tasks compared with the baseline approaches.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Common-Specific Multimodal Learning for Deep Belief Network","journalPages":"2387-2390","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133092"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","CS Games","CS-Cipher","Data (computing)","Deep belief network","High- and low-level","Image noise","Information retrieval","Modal logic","Modality (human\u2013computer interaction)","Multimodal interaction","Multimodal learning","Statistical classification"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["27208c88f07a1ffe97760c12be08fad3ab68fee2","6b40f545d3d3f18b62112ba8d0e51feaad12d16a","339db82712834ee2698c71f481dcf775fbca0d12","1835227a28b84b8e7c93a7232437b54c31c52a02","108961c7366e36825ffed94ac9eab603e05b6bc6","55e6eb5ec219e7aa71018afddaf80b35aff53d0e","05014b04223562c7c7485a1277552564d0ddc6de","284b18d7196f608448ca3d9496bf220b1dfffcf5","0d30860edf7dd5362436e6fd5262c618e33573d5","5555b28607cada5474bca772e1cc553b624415c9","2ec2f8cd6cf1a393acbc7881b8c81a78269cf5f7","373f76633cc1f6c7a421e31c989842021a52fca4"],"id":"ad5e7a4823883af5a5118ab88179a5746ec528cb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ad5e7a4823883af5a5118ab88179a5746ec528cb","authors":[{"name":"Changsheng Xiang","ids":["6877934"]},{"name":"Xiaoming Jin","ids":["39665252"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133092"}

However, in many real world applications the data is dynamic, i.e., new data arrives at different time intervals. As a result, the tensors used to represent the data grow in size. Besides the tensors, in many real world scenarios, side information is also available in the form of matrices which also grow in size with time. The problem of predicting missing values in the dynamically growing tensor is called dynamic tensor completion. Most of the previous work in dynamic tensor completion make an assumption that the tensor grows only in one mode. To the best of our Knowledge, there is no previous work which incorporates side information with dynamic tensor completion. We bridge this gap in this paper by proposing a dynamic tensor completion framework called Side Information infused Incremental Tensor Analysis (SIITA), which incorporates side information and works for general incremental tensors. We also show how non-negative constraints can be incorporated with SIITA, which is essential for mining interpretable latent clusters. We carry out extensive experiments on multiple real world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of SIITA in various different settings.","inCitations":["82ec28afa856dec4de90f4e9642b5f5935775d2f"],"pmid":"","title":"Inductive Framework for Multi-Aspect Streaming Tensor Completion with Side Information.","journalPages":"307-316","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271713","https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/grfd5zl5yyzbyug/siita.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06371v3.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06371"],"entities":["Algorithm","Experiment","Inductive reasoning","Missing data"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3f6e1701114c510ce23b6a9c0caaf970daab7a4d","3245a393ed7a443c7c131135e57dcef21b4da72f","53af40f76d3a2aedf854477fd669f40069fb402a","aeb2cb46d608456ec6f0151fa5466e292737c507","64d32e9ed48d663837a52e241934ca8637b6172b","481eadc1511574a6375ae1a04e4dc1e824d09de5","414829dee422ed930e3a04face67c74b292f5499","7b4a09d7676124889d823bca8bea33e9a6cbcd27","aa542e710b504a5a92a70eebd337bf031ef4aaa0","339639cb9f9f80288e40e24d954450e3dac34ef1","4b16f26abac208754906db3f4d3e8835c9d20607","3583a006ae6f789a652b6d21f3ee37163497d6ca","a54b2b2b9b19c1a726ca82343270f2b88516d2a5","1d0f25989452abbbc8feaf00a034ff110fc4b350","882a18810cd2183ff6e6bf76770dabb79b4b681d","224ee20c67b4dccf664595dc5f9fabcad0defe9a","18c8f13b7b77bd0c67ddbdadf21cc3545b443068","d1a6841facad41e626ca5256b4a67b193705d222","2eb506f4a2131a4907a71438bd2adb7e51d461b7","08d0612dea89d7fc231a5bcc3e62998d804412b3","3605d6dd16c087e7b194313e89d6bd5c921d0462","70560383cbf7c0dc5e9be1f2fd9efba905377095","276ebc620a8976026bd2d03582b9ecfa3738d43c","18977c6f7abb245691f4268ccd116036bd2391f0","6912297a9f404ff6dd23cb3bb3ff5c4981f68162","dbf27e801a0e5281125b149ab5cc3c47382e567f","3824ce6b19f81cfb51a4f8fd87c1ecd6fa213f97","be526565a4599459169be02e26c3e3f1e5f7f9e0","d56af5c103d5ce06b879eb4d7e45aa46822853a4","8d06d8c7e6ce17036d048cd527a0b48df3590091","4f6adc53798d9da26369bea5a0d91ed5e1314df2","63cd2482cdc8dfab89c9f98f893a6647cdfa08e0","13dc7205433523de3b1baec4b063f883693d1472","61aaa82a353b269efe3d8a6ee1db248b0aac0727","116cbad0ad34f83023d0b231f378dae2975e3b5e"],"id":"156bcc21e9287e578b565b367f554d0d9f08f1de","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/156bcc21e9287e578b565b367f554d0d9f08f1de","authors":[{"name":"Madhav Nimishakavi","ids":["3407987"]},{"name":"Bamdev Mishra","ids":["37585320"]},{"name":"Manish Gupta","ids":["46722320"]},{"name":"Partha Talukdar","ids":["35426655"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271713"}

While it is true that a researcher in IR is expected to acquire some knowledge of what has gone before, this knowledge is typically fairly narrow in scope. there are some IR researchers who regard IR as a branch of computer science, for example, despite the fact that the field has a long and venerable history entirely outside the domain of computers, as well as a considerable current presence in academic departments well away from CSDs. Outside of our immediate community, there is a widespread belief that web search engines arose out of nothing, a totally new invention for the totally new world of the web. This is unfortunate. It is true that there were huge changes in the information retrieval world in the second half of the twentiethcentury. The ideas, methods and systems that were around in 2000 (particularly the early web search engines, up to and including Google) seem at first glance to be completely different from the ideas, methods and systems that were around in 1950. But these developments involved in large measure the usual process of evolution rather than revolution, and the usual mix of steps large or small, forwards or backwards or sideways. Some of these steps were taken in the world of IR research, and some in the domain of practical commercial systems.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Forward to the Past: Notes towards a Pre-history of Web Search","journalPages":"1","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080643"],"entities":["Computer science","Information retrieval","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"19bf17906e2841d4efceb285716242b3cd0c504e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/19bf17906e2841d4efceb285716242b3cd0c504e","authors":[{"name":"Stephen E.

While most existing methods focus on modelling similarity, our primary aim is to learn embeddings that are interpretable, in the sense that query terms have a direct geometric representation in the vector space. Intuitively, we want all entities that have some property (i.e. for which a given term is relevant) to be located in some well-defined region of the space. This is achieved by imposing max-margin constraints that are derived from a bag-of-words representation of the entities. The resulting vector spaces provide us with a natural vehicle for identifying entities that have a given property (or ranking them according to how much they have the property), and conversely, to describe what a given set of entities have in common. As we show in our experiments, our models lead to a substantially better performance in a range of entity-oriented search tasks, such as list completion and entity ranking.","inCitations":["e8589643bb30ac4c81d96008eabb07f28a02eb13","39f9e2d57e783b52c59220fd89f9d4f6ba4a9579","523377642995e009d33b88f0df9926fc3c0274fc","729fbc6664890c4e78cbcb2686a9b5e895255485","e9302c3fee03abb5dd6e134118207272c1dcf303","f8713e65026431bac902e3d7f7f822a5dcbe9d1f"],"pmid":"","title":"MEmbER: Max-Margin Based Embeddings for Entity Retrieval","journalPages":"783-792","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://kar.kent.ac.uk/69598/1/Member-SIGIR.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080803","http://orca.cf.ac.uk/100910/1/MEmbER___SIGIR_2017-10.pdf"],"entities":["Bag-of-words model","Entity","Experiment","Kasparov's Gambit","Numerical analysis","Ordinal data","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7878cf925311291f53e45a2e0bdffe478b236682","9f5d1ac4bd9900238ac238fa221191aa436e87a1","448345e5386edac7942b26227610053be7563f23","021aac664fc1a2f5d3c4d833dec96289d77e2b5f","994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726","38a417e821f4d8001329f20ee28b7cc5ef9e5af7","607a834558b16c318be9c735bea048ae6638841d","2a3f862199883ceff5e3c74126f0c80770653e05","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","3a0e788268fafb23ab20da0e98bb578b06830f7d","23cb9cb90a31ca7c899beeae5dac22be0ffdaaf9","36a181c75ecf77be863cea34adb21398fadd7b5f","45cc0801e1949728bc98f9e95129d1a48c36afbc","68a33a3afac65eb6e0fb3726c1f9c8b727f32a42","f78f44cc34929ad18c32b936a8c47fd55c580643","3d73d4b69fcf11da0e461507b48d02425aeffada","4cf090824b89b4fddebc659f09ddca4aafafcdd7","9092bf4d0716ebd8c3ec931814aba2b84da9029d","48a12a320ec4751096e9bb298bf16b4dfb29a8bf","543a68fcc4d48726abdef66a2befcd23f154eb3a","318b558717ff9a4a996e45368b26a1233f03d1d7","27211ed68a7a00f1df0121fa1890a1b2acdd1a88","1081a81d93c74d83c3fa0f7a78d3f987c117739f","5936c2e590b18cd57e83b2f91363da0bfea1538c","1b9483efbac9894715344bf1ece48d65519223bb","44d442bf3acf0fb1ad87ffbe7dd1683e08c5952b","3734d31548756bb315e5b613cd6e9245c00b1430","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","b8a6f43eb2bc2a277e80261e0a8a78e5e9b45457","34d0d27e63ae5ac8fc8d00809973d5baf13ce927","b78f9987638719b714a19202a33114bb46335a4d","bcae9da4151d4accf3d90ef8bab883fbec35cb85","2e42bf8747363161851dc04b85aedb1ada50daaf","9b087350cfa1d07bc97329ddbf73b8cd0dc616ab","4752c1ee6ef02a122af7ecb60aa2f044f840e004","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","16524adee515692a50dd67a170b8e605e4b00b29","1944fda0d2aad86fdfac5f3c0d5c3b4055fa1336","0826c98d1b1513aa2f45e6654bb5075a58b64649","6d4f576fcf003c5659525331d760b174fa6631a8","f3999b9749d5f0b71f638bcc998dc14f2e0a6cbe","588ccc8d75b050b692fd5d47a0b4ae7082d473ce"],"id":"c3ede682a04147e01a6a7246624c898b02d89f36","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3ede682a04147e01a6a7246624c898b02d89f36","authors":[{"name":"Shoaib Jameel","ids":["38797620"]},{"name":"Zied Bouraoui","ids":["1871846"]},{"name":"Steven Schockaert","ids":["2265382"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080803"}

{"doiUrl":"","venue":"BIR@ECIR","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2018,"paperAbstract":"We propose a citationand text-based framework to conduct literature review searches. Given a small set of articles included in a literature review (i.e. seed articles), the first step of the framework retrieves articles that are connected to the seed articles in the citation network. The next step filters these retrieved articles using a hybrid citation and text-based criteria. In this paper, we evaluate a first implementation of this framework (code available at https://github.com/janinaj/ lit-review-search) by comparing it to the conventional search methods for retrieving the included studies of 6 published systematic reviews. Using different combinations of 3 seed articles, on average we retrieved 71.2% of the total included studies in the published reviews and 82.33% of the studies available in the search database (Scopus). Our best combinations retrieved 87% of the total included studies, which comprised 100% of the studies available in Scopus. In 5 of the 6 reviews, we reduced the number of results by 34\u201388%, which in practice would save reviewers significant time, since the overall number of search results that need to be manually screened is substantially reduced. These results suggest that our framework is a promising approach to improving the literature review search process.","inCitations":["0fd73a27351243d19088c169d156a77782e5a667","80696067eed3ff6a9077e5a72f82e269dc48357d"],"pmid":"","title":"Testing a Citation and Text-Based Framework for Retrieving Publications for Literature Reviews","journalPages":"22-33","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/45c0/cd8a022442c803b75b8fc9b1ef8fb48ab0ee.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2080/paper3.pdf","https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/99900/BIR%20-%20Testing%20a%20Citation%20and%20Text-Based%20Framework%20for%20Retrieving%20Publications%20for%20Literature%20Reviews.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=2"],"entities":["Citation network","Informatics","Projection screen","Scopus","Systematic review","Text-based (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["80da6bce3e4fefe41fe5ca29bfd38070e19d4357","0de4ad868dec25a2c91a85e9d7bf64d4bca7f1fb","3a9583dd372a05326bf7c6cdc3d6de0c520f2715","8038f8f0d74911d69280e8b1ee8b51822f051e13","93492590fc5935ec5a303a667d91bac3c08fcdd6","1fa8a88a256afb5f946919ba1623b5d2d65b33c3","9db76483396369a3e61a0fc918c6415fd6892869","e281464d9a558cc1d25084687efb75683e65d4f0","bd5b9c8ef53bc8ff29441a0aa832851171c211bf","01deebfc9e8ab895385a12cbe15545acb2186601","be7e1e302f7dc59d9d01e1a80326bbc8d662b861","7baf303531ad2c22fd4ce54f31e10dfe8d4925b8","e71ab6079ee0665f8cba07e71991d0ee0a9e5ce4","8d6bce146d838d80c651c07ab03fa14570b7df43","2ac254c5174a536312cfebb2436ce6e27cbad827","f26f533e221b51cf13dfaab07854dfc36cc04268","bfa8438eb37e303b8bd0f22acdc76f0555e4a3de","646d80dcc5bcbf7006a0559329dc4d18e10c82e0","f1294289b2b320e85daa7becfb9a24231560687b","b8ad472a060d502455c7014334fcb827d49b5fb8","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","27dc15a7f2370d45a2aa4084b69dbfb0c9a74569","905275929f9105b1e0e19dc906f4e4166b2d1516","3c74f24df0a0eaddd4c4c43563e375980e26f276","3bf4293957bc475818d39c3fbec16db330d3e08a","12733a91782d7a92319241d2b04696a0f1d48243","f91f14f6a37caa5b3c15728e63ecd1fd055a9793"],"id":"45c0cd8a022442c803b75b8fc9b1ef8fb48ab0ee","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/45c0cd8a022442c803b75b8fc9b1ef8fb48ab0ee","authors":[{"name":"Maria Janina Sarol","ids":["10305789"]},{"name":"Linxi Liu","ids":["9120610"]},{"name":"Jodi Schneider","ids":["1692044"]}],"doi":""}

However, many government documents contain sensitive information, such as confidential information, that is exempt from release. Therefore, government documents must be sensitivity reviewed prior to release, to identify and close any sensitive information. With the adoption of born-digital documents, such as email, there is a need for automatic sensitivity classification to assist digital sensitivity review. SVM classifiers and Part-of-Speech sequences have separately been shown to be promising for sensitivity classification. However, sequence classification methodologies, and specifically SVM kernel functions, have not been fully investigated for sensitivity classification. Therefore, in this work, we present an evaluation of five SVM kernel functions for sensitivity classification using POS sequences. Moreover, we show that an ensemble classifier that combines POS sequence classification with text classification can significantly improve sensitivity classification effectiveness (+6.09% F2) compared with a text classification baseline, according to McNemar's test of significance.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Study of SVM Kernel Functions for Sensitivity Classification Ensembles with POS Sequences","journalPages":"1097-1100","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3077136.3080731","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/142960/7/142960.pdf","http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~graham/publications/sigir2017_mcdonald.pdf"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Confidentiality","Document classification","Email","Ensemble Kalman filter","Ensemble learning","Freedom of information laws by country","Information sensitivity","N-gram","Sensitivity and specificity","Statistical classification"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ed06c16aabcc0a9674bbb3bef3a6abd11d9eb966","03acfc428d38e4e6136513658695cfc1956b5945","6fe5825fc2b7b7710e5dc3eae22f848a2843b858","4c482356f444ce8d0750e7beb02fcd031efc18ed","399ced295ec9ec013d2a724babe4451028997c4d","13e013398a425c4ace819f6c26c1432030dbfd1a","0704bb7b7918cd512b5e66ea4b4993e50b8ae92f","7d88cf6f71acff3680c1413cec0fa18b8710167e","13082af1fd6bb9bfe63e73cf007de1655b7f9ae0","2aec4a2aa286a0093bf124482ed106f7e965ee8b","412ce1b721e43953da1a0dc36762ed252b03b0c1","47dd6b9d9cedbe2526ad22a01ca4fea1025e07d1","6b6f187b136616c0514f384ee17dc167498ef619","019475245d325f70fc3c930b9e96c0c48196ca21","40c5441aad96b366996e6af163ca9473a19bb9ad","509bf8d7ac8ff4334c5aee5771183da0fd9c7a42"],"id":"52757efc7ef85ebfa4c2d374e1a35a4005340b37","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/52757efc7ef85ebfa4c2d374e1a35a4005340b37","authors":[{"name":"Graham McDonald","ids":["38657905"]},{"name":"Nicolás García-Pedrajas","ids":["1688081"]},{"name":"Craig MacDonald","ids":["2691614"]},{"name":"Iadh Ounis","ids":["1698205"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080731"}

How many from outside the IR system? What is the role of the used search system? To investigate these questions we used data from two experiments: first, from a user study with eye tracking data; second, from a large-scale log analysis.

We present a distant supervision approach addressing this challenge without using explicitly labeled data. We use plausibly good but imperfect definition sentences from Wikipedia as references to annotate sentences in a target corpus based on text similarity measures such as ROUGE. Experimental results show our approach is highly effective, generating noisy but large, useful, and localized training instances. Definition sentence retrieval models trained using the synthesized training examples are more effective than those learned from manual judgments of a few thousand sentences. We also examine different text similarity measures for annotation, including both unsupervised and supervised ones. We show that our method can significantly benefit from supervised text similarity measures learned from either external training data (from the SemEval Semantic Text Similarity task) or local ones (a few hundred judged sentences on the target corpus). Our method offers a cheap, effective, and flexible solution to this task and can benefit a broad range of applications such as web search engines and QA systems.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Similarity-based Distant Supervision for Definition Retrieval","journalPages":"527-536","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://maroo.cs.umass.edu/pub/web/getpdf.php?id=1221","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3133032"],"entities":["Heuristic","ROUGE (metric)","SIM lock","SemEval","Software quality assurance","Supervised learning","Text corpus","Unsupervised learning","Web search engine","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["605fa6d94be36542eadef05a5e3b3cfa1ec37fec","4e60a6056457916eaebf91d90ae53b72d04a6c16","45fc709a2fb8cd3cc71462c65e3d5e1bcb23c444","17e4c300ed70a92b404b2cee297d6a634fbe733d","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","045c633ba4829add9d69b34224cb9347aa1acd6a","67fc461fac073d0669f5a56ec96f9df35e050429","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","8b302ae180547430d9201aae1cbde5e0852a623b","2504669f9c9f79352a83dc554fda61d41c5e0736","09ebe623a28cfef73c06ffdf8eadc6cd9b6f97e9","d333fdfcc56483336f0428e48bc11cd26cac28d8","e0fb3ab6dfdf9c351e2c837e480850b4186aa961","255e97d82f528b613dbe8883727abfd14f3f9f39","1aa88d275eaa0746031dcd567e4c1a6777a13e37","604809686a977df714f76b823d4fce48e67ee3ba","8ff93cfd37dced279134c9d642337a2085b31f59","3946979cb1ac2737c14208958e92f8cd2698d44d","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","45cf7ea736444e2fefc0ccbaf598abd110fabf0d","233d861338cfcd479b1d21897453fcc66418d5e1","1a9f9dadd29466b47dfa3ae4aa9f6b47fce336bd","2c9ade5f79ca1fb68672fcf90716aaeebe160554","2d02141fd8c263d9c9a05d704c2d3e38525a7167","663f992b63e1cbbbea022856c15bcd4453af6d1a","3e555b6054aa6fd4b46f87cd632668aaf8a91db6","8f8139b63a2fc0b3ae8413acaef47acd35a356e0","04d458a49065e9cad46b243d004436a9cede3483","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","a75e912a1712776f33239bef3c432c669f442a62","9a75ef477b09fb868ee80c76602efa9e03696a67","70cb232a6e391bfa49b0441a9956820c52ec32f2","96e3b0e98705143ba0364b82a418025a123a6727","fc8431ac49d63179ab80817e05a8f3de461ce31f","364220e42ab6d60c5e44d4d0d7758bd83c4b82bd","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2","20ad0ba7e187e6f335a08c59a4e53da4e4b027ec"],"id":"2db030d076574c854cbe6252e207a63d48bdb060","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2db030d076574c854cbe6252e207a63d48bdb060","authors":[{"name":"Jiepu Jiang","ids":["1730464"]},{"name":"James Allan","ids":["1722517"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133032"}

Based on this model, a smart city\u2019s profile can be defined and characterized, under a simple comprehensive view of local needs and challenges. A particular smart city scenario is highlighted as a proof of concept for CityDNA and future design and implementation ideas are identified and justified.","inCitations":["758bec4725322d905e772cec39a1652063368514","605ba6ba91c1357a719f1ca2995a6c9fdafc0891"],"pmid":"","title":"CityDNA: Smart City Dimensions' Correlations for Identifying Urban Profile","journalPages":"1167-1172","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6757/8a9e84f7639117e0bf5000f693fc867e20bf.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1167.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054714"],"entities":["Conceptualization (information science)","Cyber-physical system","Relevance","Smart city"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["656e4fb0564d96407161d9e541a9ca15375d6c60","1ea1bebd54230b87a05311c5343511ba03317e41","21effa2eed8d79f5673525bbb9b8e967c53452c1","65a3dfd58be9db84277319ddee7b206fc7be6cad","28307c06e1bfb0a393a66c6f6cd08bb3d839fdde","d086770067e736a048525b4ec8b619f5b08ca6f1","0f72196eb401efe1b8234180752c61dfce3aa44a","9b20b49d35a1e588364ec917fed57708bbc07a01"],"id":"67578a9e84f7639117e0bf5000f693fc867e20bf","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/67578a9e84f7639117e0bf5000f693fc867e20bf","authors":[{"name":"Vaia Moustaka","ids":["10368836"]},{"name":"Athena Vakali","ids":["1741423"]},{"name":"Leonidas G.

Multimodal sentiment analysis has become an important research topic in recent years. Most of the existing work on multimodal sentiment analysis extracts features from image and text separately, and directly combine them to train a classifier. As visual and textual information in multimodal data can mutually reinforce and complement each other in analyzing the sentiment of people, previous research all ignores this mutual influence between image and text. To fill this gap, in this paper, we consider the interrelation of visual and textual information, and propose a novel co-memory network to iteratively model the interactions between visual contents and textual words for multimodal sentiment analysis. Experimental results on two public multimodal sentiment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Co-Memory Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis","journalPages":"929-932","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210093"],"entities":["Core (optical fiber)","Modality (human\u2013computer interaction)","Multimodal interaction","Sentiment analysis","Social media analytics","Text-based (computing)","User-generated content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["fdfb59f85cc3f71bcc4bef9720928aaf64fcd400","85031a4873fe4ddda4a0841b9169b2f164980f3d","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","86ff3f07de621eab484b33f5a935f01db377bf39","24aed1b7277dfb2c2a6515a1be82d30cc8aa85cc","d570f64a30de09fec39c4b8237c98fb368811c24","71a96306f9ffa3b96b4d0bb87dd922c901fadbc5","9c31e1731344afcd14e9992ed0e747911d8ea815","40a938f61314f0f79319656d11c040044f883a07","0626908dd710b91aece1a81f4ca0635f23fc47f3","716b3cdace1f0efc3ef6c3fd1dc283c22118684d","15cf63f8d44179423b4100531db4bb84245aa6f1","2d13971cf59761b76fa5fc08e96f4e56c0c2d6dc"],"id":"0b80a8a54437ce1d9c17249b6f6de14d9a6604b0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0b80a8a54437ce1d9c17249b6f6de14d9a6604b0","authors":[{"name":"Nan Xu","ids":["49183525"]},{"name":"Wenji Mao","ids":["2419472"]},{"name":"Guandan Chen","ids":["23121526"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210093"}

Optimizing queries in such scenarios is particularly challenging not only because of (i) the large variety of possible query execution plans that correctly answer the query but also because (ii) there is only limited access to statistics about schema and instance data of remote sources. To overcome these challenges, most federated query engines rely on heuristics to reduce the space of possible query execution plans or on dynamic programming strategies to produce optimal plans. Nevertheless, these plans may still exhibit a high number of intermediate results or high execution times because of heuristics and inaccurate cost estimations. In this paper, we present Odyssey, an approach that uses statistics that allow for a more accurate cost estimation for federated queries. Our experimental results show that Odyssey produces query execution plans that are better in terms of data transfer and execution time than stateof-the-art optimizers. Our experiments using the FedBench benchmark show execution time gains of at least one order of magnitude on average.","inCitations":["f233971d80089b9eeaab3f38e7666a5a6b97ea64","071a3b21ae16ae9f961bfc06b0117ff116566cfa","f07d6c1b3a18ab89cc14853d687756cfbb3808d9","a254ce889df8d1da1fe0c507cbb14615d421d169","e62b170a64316c58c842b9e93e140ba28e919faa","24d9e02f44a7f6e862f7cfc5e45527ec9bf2a382","86c333c0e5a406680862fd0ea8e835e483afcfe0"],"pmid":"","title":"The Odyssey Approach for Optimizing Federated SPARQL Queries","journalPages":"471-489","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b34/67abae4b6573f2686816d42f6b6416b0f327.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_28","http://videolectures.net/site/normal_dl/tag=1145332/iswc2017_montoya_sparql_queries_01.pdf","https://iswc2017.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/MainProceedings/204.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06135","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06135v3.pdf"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Dynamic programming","Experiment","Federated search","Field (computer science)","Heuristic (computer science)","Optimizing compiler","Query string","Run time (program lifecycle phase)","SPARQL"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["642843a5541b338f4a067777386eeb4839adcaa4","42222e7097192b9da03eed759943c0695eed14ee","52719b0ed970047fc257b05915d371ebb1cd7012","20a2c64440cca5c167c24fa54808c2d79a2be36f","6171143a059cdb3848a2ac529f1bd3c5a0b7871c","4ccf4d74f4ea5c5aec95d9825ac564136ef4fad6","9149edb98db02ebd804644b348b490b2d747070f","bf334e47c55632bf03395a514ac59dfb46b711df","4c87f7853b0d7924b2d25f5fe2b5c31912bde785","0364684670d8200ac68ebc00ea3e1c9bf59a952e","5fadf7c41cbc9bd13437e2046b2b59263127648c","07fe857668481972668471d23a386d782562a626","18797ef47a86e7535fe7e7441080695ea16a3173","cd722091ccadbd8946c514f510e9000192943410","38e1c6498a0709a174ddf5bfa97f32ba92541d4b","97e36035f1b9e689ac5a162ef57546fcfe63989f","0fa3b1e638ee638f4203ab9eacc7f4d391250e62","124126f1f2688a6acff92e6752a3b0cd33dc50b0","0a728d9e2d96de0fd9ab13c41a5e01ba9eab20e1","1e1fdc0a8ef06c85ed664e880712b764900145b6","42a44fda03e42f539c6ab743212ae1bcf7c7dcb7","074896a318b651212c4a08099fc33b5a3c26a2f9"],"id":"f840e7dde0d0f6e9670ca76e2095a6f8c37b7c9c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f840e7dde0d0f6e9670ca76e2095a6f8c37b7c9c","authors":[{"name":"Gabriela Montoya","ids":["34872616"]},{"name":"Hala Skaf-Molli","ids":["1830003"]},{"name":"Katja Hose","ids":["1682407"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_28"}

The sequence type attribute provides important information about the nature of a sequence represented in a record, and is often used in search to filter out irrelevant sequences. However, the sequence type attribute is generally a non-mandatory free-text field, and thus it is subject to many errors including typos, mis-assignment, and non-assignment. In GenBank, this problem concerns roughly 18% of records, an alarming number that should worry the biocuration community. To address this problem of automatic sequence type classification, we propose the use of literature associated to sequence records as an external source of knowledge that can be leveraged for the classification task. We define a set of literature-based features and train a machine learning algorithm to classify a record into one of six primary sequence types. The main intuition behind using the literature for this task is that sequences appear to be discussed differently in scientific articles, depending on their type. The experiments we have conducted on the PubMed Central collection show that the literature is indeed an effective way to address this problem of sequence type classification. Our classification method reached an accuracy of 92.7%, and substantially outperformed two baseline approaches used for comparison.","inCitations":["702352c0cf9361965fb2818a745f773abf13909d"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning Biological Sequence Types Using the Literature","journalPages":"1991-1994","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3133051"],"entities":["Algorithm","Automatic sequence","Baseline (configuration management)","Biocurator","Experiment","GenBank","Information source","Machine learning","PubMed Central","Relevance","Scientific literature","Sequence alignment","Sequence database","The Australian"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ec3473ad70d48f4a831a1c59b344d619fb90b337","0f16f6f478b5c788dce466eb50e36c612273c36e","9f2f7da9992595eaf32fc7c42b3a7c40d17a3f85","a465df197c698cc5c03bfa1b261bc007e3ba775c","1918b0273933ffa9f85a4b072bdac7b68fc3f3e2","101e8bb35354e934c17f3857936f1cba4da268bf","15aaa5d8177ec4d021c8b87d669377ccc583a43a","22d1e8ecaf4b42cd761aecbaf736190a6e680470","d768bdf4485e59497b639e7425beb0347e08c62b","8c1c21f18da180dedf14b48f5842473d9c9057e3"],"id":"c6826b6bb5fbcda87a0ec6729e8b5f9dddcc2fd7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c6826b6bb5fbcda87a0ec6729e8b5f9dddcc2fd7","authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek","ids":["3080469"]},{"name":"Karin M.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on knowledge graph, which takes advantage of both knowledge reasoning and statistic learning. First, we present a model to build a knowledge graph for the given entity. The knowledge graph integrates the fragmented knowledge on how humans create morphs.

There is a large literature on graph sampling, where the goal is to estimate properties (especially the degree distribution) of a large graph through a small, random sample. Estimating the degree distribution of real-world graphs poses a significant challenge, due to their heavy-tailed nature and the large variance in degrees. We design a new algorithm, SADDLES, for this problem, using recent mathematical techniques from the field of sublinear algorithms. The SADDLES algorithm gives provably accurate outputs for all values of the degree distribution. For the analysis, we define two fatness measures of the degree distribution, called the h-index and the z-index. We prove that SADDLES is sublinear in the graph size when these indices are large. A corollary of this result is a provably sublinear algorithm for any degree distribution bounded below by a power law. We deploy our new algorithm on a variety of real datasets and demonstrate its excellent empirical behavior. In all instances, we get extremely accurate approximations for all values in the degree distribution by observing at most 1% of the vertices. This is a major improvement over the state-of-the-art sampling algorithms, which typically sample more than 10% of the vertices to give comparable results. We also observe that the h and z-indices of real graphs are large, validating our theoretical analysis. ACM Reference Format: Talya Eden, Shweta Jain, Ali Pinar, Dana Ron, and C. Seshadhri. 2018.

The article fails to fulfill the promise made by the headline. Traditional methods for clickbait detection have relied heavily on feature engineering which, in turn, is dependent on the dataset it is built for. The application of neural networks for this task has only been explored partially. We propose a novel approach considering all information found in a social media post. We train a bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism to learn the extent to which a word contributes to the post's clickbait score in a differential manner. We also employ a Siamese net to capture the similarity between source and target information. Information gleaned from images has not been considered in previous approaches. We learn image embeddings from large amounts of data using Convolutional Neural Networks to add another layer of complexity to our model. Finally, we concatenate the outputs from the three separate components, serving it as input to a fully connected layer. We conduct experiments over a test corpus of 19538 social media posts, attaining an F1 score of 65.37% on the dataset bettering the previous state-of-the-art, as well as other proposed approaches, feature engineering or otherwise.","inCitations":["282e44399bc6e35d7e72bcae5a2e8123833d543f"],"pmid":"","title":"Identifying Clickbait: A Multi-Strategy Approach Using Neural Networks","journalPages":"1225-1228","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01507","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01507v4.pdf","http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/download/inproceedings.pdf.8bf7e3f02dfe0a6a.4964656e74696679696e6720436c69636b626169743a2041204d756c74692d537472617465677920417070726f616368205573696e67204e657572616c2e706466.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210144"],"entities":["Clickbait","Concatenation","Convolutional neural network","Experiment","F1 score","Feature engineering","Internet","Long short-term memory","Monetization","Neural Networks","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["dc0fcfffa7fc9e2e84598fa318c78987b57de1ed","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","2ef79a97c3c2c4481e3f62c898a54d904f191730","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","f9467adac17f3ef6d65cdcf38b46afb974abfa55","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","817b4d24643ac0d36ea9e647f0c144abd6b2da10","8729441d734782c3ed532a7d2d9611b438c0a09a","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","83e7f9689cd13131a4bad225575d6024896bc3c4","35b11ac652646c70a559f7ae29295e1d5de09a80","f70391f9a6aeec75bc52b9fe38588b9d0b4d40c6","19b95fb6fbbfe6fdbcdcfebced8b37ee9769abf5","83a6cacc126d85c45605797406262677c256a6af","6afa9012b618ad7ce8793d2ed16b6615498c2b9a","4fdbd729d2f958049dd9f61a03e662ad5fd301fc","817c801c4e903c5cba02be516d33c0b30d5dfbd1","ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","5c8b33a27a7cb05481572f045fc27e82150895f3"],"id":"f30bd28d6917665f97b0be86e8f5d7c672c966f2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f30bd28d6917665f97b0be86e8f5d7c672c966f2","authors":[{"name":"Vaibhav Kumar","ids":["40021586"]},{"name":"Dhruv Khattar","ids":["2319272"]},{"name":"Siddhartha Gairola","ids":["37886984"]},{"name":"Yash Kumar Lal","ids":["27604402"]},{"name":"Vasudeva Varma","ids":["1704709"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210144"}

When messages have time sensitive information, it becomes relevant for the sender to know what is the expected time within which the email will be read by the recipient. In this paper we use a survival analysis framework to predict the time to open an email once it has been received. We use the Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model that offers a way to combine various features that might affect the event of opening an email. As an extension, we also apply a mixture model (MM) approach to CoxPH that distinguishes between recipients, based on a latent state of how prone to opening the messages each individual is. We compare our approach with standard classification and regression models. While the classification model provides predictions on the likelihood of an email being opened, the regression model provides prediction of the real-valued time to open. The use of survival analysis based methods allows us to jointly model both the open event as well as the time-to-open. We experimented on a large real-world dataset of marketing emails sent in a 3-month time duration. The mixture model achieves the best accuracy on our data where a high proportion of email messages go unopened.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Modeling Time to Open of Emails with a Latent State for User Engagement Level","journalPages":"531-539","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159683"],"entities":["Average-case complexity","Email","Information sensitivity","Interaction","Mixture model"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e1aa03da10f65ceb3230bb4c12ecdf4ed383d46d","b65ba3f48199a938926816c124912b01bc7cee54","00cdf25beacb9e46fc1d9a9d9a06d6b5f110168e","efe973075ac6c86965fdc937e44d5bbac34d00c9","beaef29b14489ef7475c12493dda0e96ac6d8dd0","a124ebb78ef2bac73d6184aea723f667a5a37f0d","537d612036f5bcb9d42966e31e79d9026ac47f52","5251b6170ac80da4b6f6dbb3dcb542985d217e8f","2360bb9ea10622c8c21595ade8f43cc237aac230","914b546c38ad7927599c7c253fbb330c8d2d9372","7b8833ee8d9a78f9bf0696527ac68c5e5d957fb7","5d162a07088353fd1b59ba1a73f29f869779ccbb","3e9b0bb7465a6b13b2fb642a4433c8693639c517","3486262aa99faca6f83fe01618c50e1cd43937d2","61f791da2488e9e24745fff79f58b1fad804c4e6","1a90d626588096803e41a2c17aa442a855c5cfc4","6771a35e5c248d78ddb31c929e623485320dee69","1af04f0e576722fc8c79c19ddb5bc6c19e78767d","56ccfcfc5e45ad9c010f2937aa4e998d110a63e1","1cd21e0af5489947a65c72b1030015b6ce1462d6","b0ce2d6250cdf4595f83d7d41551647f505f467f","7005f995565aba08f6cf06256a280dcfdd7bacc8","80fc283900e930a8ab5d7b525f258cf620b9bf8e","361be180a5d9636ff54461a2065ed17d8dc8b462","c4806efffa95a727006d2d6284240f2c181f75ab","ecb6fdb7624ef1e48548f91edfad6fd8c79dc5ba","855031b3eb28138072c1934b8a6515a6694fa5d4","8ca31559febf899ea7b2c9c97e6f73aada2154b9","87f602449c2dd5f8b308cff9f3617c234cd14848","46217f372a75dddc2254fdbc6b9418ba3554e453","3b41bb3a470fbfba54283331f31256cc09f0f37e","64c22174a3a43c1224c88ba37eae6421a0086730"],"id":"9bc6b6402ac136d97c49344cf5eaf0f8f64771f5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9bc6b6402ac136d97c49344cf5eaf0f8f64771f5","authors":[{"name":"Moumita Sinha","ids":["49856495"]},{"name":"Vishwa Vinay","ids":["3121908"]},{"name":"Harvineet Singh","ids":["20400898"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159683"}

The goal of this study is to better understand people's attitudes toward careful information seeking via Web search, and the relationship between such attitudes and their daily search behaviors. To this end, we conducted two experiments. We first administrated an online questionnaire to investigate how people's attitudes toward using the strategies for verifying information in the Web search process differ based on various factors such as their credulity toward Web information, individual thinking styles, educational background, and search expertise. We then analyzed their one-year and one-month query logs of a commercial Web search engine to explore how their daily search behaviors are different according to their attitudes. The analysis of the questionnaire and the query logs obtained from ¥subjects participants revealed that (i) the people's attitudes toward using the verification strategies in Web search are positively correlated to their Need for Cognition (NFC), educational background, and search expertise; (ii) people with strong attitudes are likely to click lower-ranked search results than those with intermediate levels of attitude; (iii) people with strong attitudes are more likely to use the terms such as \"evidence'' or \"truth'' in their queries, possibly to scrutinize the uncertain or incredible information; and (iv) the behavioral differences found in (ii) and (iii) are not identified from the differences in the participants' educational backgrounds. These findings help us explore future directions for a new Web search system that encourages people to be more careful in Web search, and suggest the need for an educational program or training to facilitate the attitudes and skills for using Web search engines to obtain accurate information.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Exploring People's Attitudes and Behaviors Toward Careful Information Seeking in Web Search.","journalPages":"963-972","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271799"],"entities":["Authentication","Cognition","Experiment","Information seeking","Log analysis","Near field communication","Web page","Web search engine","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e985ac2e151903000cac310ffbc5b2cb4fbb9dd5","2464c81560bf5d97cbde580e4885421c2d0b9cab","19c87fd2b04438562959e2bdc488dedcb6aff21f","3fec6927bc6f0a1ef40e10a9c1a297d6764ab599","2bc5513d8eeabcbfa28e21df730ea81fa8ad5ea4","3f0f0eb4d1d353dcf0fc59b731378cfe9ac41a5d","e324efc190cd500fde2944418f8bfda17f802901","6b99b0b230eb4bb0644fd862a470285645ba9425","66b1eea722031acb035b8ccc585c40e9873f6746","a7ac85219ca252334b2bab2be636fe0cc95c128a","2605950d309fb18d81c61d9b20dd2271c6619ee9","aa6f66350bb2f2d76d6d16029b970c4b9528e0c9","d4d5a67851c20765b5a9453cdae9bd07388e2c2a","c62b985348d90cba53a7884fe9247e4bfde0ec49","5ba7592fe3310106543cffad644addeffc2ad2b3","1789d82fe2330ee07c01e08a4b2730acb329949e","3210077ce6b40d016b52e432a373edb56121eadd","2930aaac27bf9f5b392fa644b723bf6d484d9d14","07be7606bb170ec43584533f02cc0b3d46198d9e","3a8a544153d9761024844d6a05619f535b14dca8","3805496b3b21a770e7b235444dbcef41a7375898","9927d1e3ca2001ee9fd53c6b5f07f0309e5eb318","477928d562839cfbde209501a0a8ec5212b846b7"],"id":"03e9e6d0ea33e4458a5f257194f83018f4fb7b28","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03e9e6d0ea33e4458a5f257194f83018f4fb7b28","authors":[{"name":"Takehiro Yamamoto","ids":["3089862"]},{"name":"Yusuke Yamamoto","ids":["14381887"]},{"name":"Sumio Fujita","ids":["33208854"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271799"}

While some previous approaches have explored this direction, their results are still far from satisfactory due to their reliance on performance of sentiment analysis and limited capabilities of learning direct relations between target stock trends and their daily social texts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cross-modal attention based Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (CH-RNN), which is inspired by the recent proposed DA-RNN model. Specifically, CH-RNN consists of two essential modules. One adopts DA-RNN to gain stock trend representations for different stocks. The other utilizes recurrent neural network to model daily aggregated social texts. These two modules interact seamlessly by the following two manners: 1) daily representations of target stock trends from the first module are leveraged to select trend-related social texts through a cross-modal attention mechanism, and 2) representations of text sequences and trend series are further integrated. The comprehensive experiments on the real dataset we build demonstrate the effectiveness of CH-RNN and benefit of considering social texts.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Hybrid Deep Sequential Modeling for Social Text-Driven Stock Prediction","journalPages":"1627-1630","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269290"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Deep learning","Experiment","Modal logic","Random neural network","Recurrent neural network","Sentiment analysis","Social media"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2cf379819632deb93b2cd9250da25bf21fa25171","27ee75e2047bac3ae9fc3b4f09aa610d14104f5c","07a3a4ab89157511c9bc5ca8aa572ef773aae02f","43bb4b073f7b2b9b626c7f3263cc61932271ab74","ab27ddbbed5a7bd221de44355e3a058b5ea1b14f","4938e8c8c9ea3d351d283181819af5e5801efbed","1c2cd3188fba95d1bccdcc013224ec55443075d0","1ba5630508f1d562c19869462baebbde7e39748d","8c2d897f005bfe8e9db94bde269d4eb8b0230f78","00167b90b8fbf57d22b661c32ee8fb39020af12f","a122e270a13fd34084551372a651c21891dcdfe1","67a77d3242a357571541d39c26d305c5dda89445"],"id":"0516e326c7c760e2f8bbf0ce67a3c444f81a5148","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0516e326c7c760e2f8bbf0ce67a3c444f81a5148","authors":[{"name":"Huizhe Wu","ids":["6748258"]},{"name":"Wei Zhang","ids":["1726357"]},{"name":"Weiwei Shen","ids":["3356010"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269290"}

Having engaged, urbane, and reactive online conversations has a critical effect on the social life of Internet users. In this study, we are particularly interested in identifying a post in a multi-party conversation that is unlikely to be further replied to, which therefore kills that thread of the conversation. For this purpose, we propose a deep learning model called the ConverNet. ConverNet is attractive due to its capability of modeling the internal structure of a long conversation and its appropriate encoding of the contextual information of the conversation, through effective integration of attention mechanisms. Empirical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal model. For the widely concerned topic, our analysis also offers implications for improving the quality and user experience of online conversations.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Find the Conversation Killers: a Predictive Study of Thread-ending Posts","journalPages":"1145-1154","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08636","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186013","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08636v1.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Data mining","Deep learning","Experiment","Internet","Network model","Online chat","Online community","Recurrent neural network","User experience"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1827de6fa9c9c1b3d647a9d707042e89cf94abf0","5aaefa036e586a540a731358ad8bbc089e222061","34271ca4d5c91e258c2e5bf67a5f4d4698dd1885","625ef5356b3e8f7a787a805c23ce4c34640ed596","52e011e52d1a9e2c9ea12f31f5a2d3c1b459017e","a81874887c60c35b0f6c6f941477871fa45f33a5","17f5c7411eeeeedf25b0db99a9130aa353aee4ba","1967ad3ac8a598adc6929e9e6b9682734f789427","355667611d5d57288d004505a6d9dbc4a3969dda","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","a6e4a2532510369b8f55c68f049ff11a892fefeb","623f5236d64094cd40c819ee4248123c5d9ce1ce","3e8962aa1b0954696290ec72688edef5c5e08f2c","a772b2d623e90159021d093333c55dbeeac7bd2c","00f31994c123fbceba5d5a0e06bb78aff651aae7","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","83174a52f38c80427e237446ccda79e2a9170742","54f1460765586c7c8842e2a887b3c28c03722233","30593ad852efa6b0f7b21c0413041f9ae9d06e51","80f632dae7169eafcc4bc6435434f28d73bf1177","33fc7a58f2a4c924a5f3868eced1726ce961e559","7064bd5a311b3d29c236d64047af9c2e0abe94c9","073adb18253655098e1d88822fc19e1424c3dcd4","3fc109c976bf1c3f06aba9310f86dcd0c124ab41","205516e8c895938e4506e8bcd4187ad2f85a419f","9362b6030b77247357df8e61599ba2062e7dee16","5807664af8e63d5207f59fb263c9e7bd3673be79","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e"],"id":"58a477c1694f71f6c5f92b8e60dcc9cc711fc288","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/58a477c1694f71f6c5f92b8e60dcc9cc711fc288","authors":[{"name":"Yunhao Jiao","ids":["31410599"]},{"name":"Cheng Li","ids":["46651787"]},{"name":"Fei Wu","ids":["1695826"]},{"name":"Qiaozhu Mei","ids":["1743469"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186013"}

Most open-source toolkits developed by academics are designed to facilitate the evaluation of retrieval models over standard test collections. Efforts are generally directed toward better ranking and less attention is usually given to scalability and other operational considerations. On the other hand, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications (outside a small number of companies that deploy custom infrastructure). Compared to academic IR toolkits, Lucene can handle heterogeneous web collections at scale, but lacks systematic support for evaluation over standard test collections. This paper introduces Anserini, a new information retrieval toolkit that aims to provide the best of both worlds, to better align information retrieval practice and research. Anserini provides wrappers and extensions on top of core Lucene libraries that allow researchers to use more intuitive APIs to accomplish common research tasks. Our initial efforts have focused on three functionalities: scalable, multi-threaded inverted indexing to handle modern web-scale collections, streamlined IR evaluation for ad hoc retrieval on standard test collections, and an extensible architecture for multi-stage ranking. Anserini ships with support for many TREC test collections, providing a convenient way to replicate competitive baselines right out of the box. Experiments verify that our system is both efficient and effective, providing a solid foundation to support future research.","inCitations":["3c3e27872d7f1a0f783c49b809a58d3ad4b8d904","5ec9d876c3650c6783106dd5ad3fab86663f333e","10fa13117d33291d0570f00c3d09254a09afb62c","1490a399d8e9b7e5eb5059b5556909adc04c6b12","497ebc6faeca695740a402ba5ee974f3d3a6ee38"],"pmid":"","title":"Anserini: Enabling the Use of Lucene for Information Retrieval Research","journalPages":"1253-1256","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/publications/Yang_etal_SIGIR2017.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080721"],"entities":["Align (company)","Deep learning","Experiment","Hoc (programming language)","Information retrieval","Library (computing)","List of toolkits","Numerical integration","Open-source software","Out of the box (feature)","Reinventing the wheel","Scalability","Self-replicating machine","Self-replication","TensorFlow","Text Retrieval Conference","Thinking outside the box","Thread (computing)","Torch","Virtual community"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4c5cc16b8f890faaa23be30f752fe2a8a935f87f","00539f3da855c8f36660f5121c280e5860fc63bb","bc68f3667fbd53113e140a0b9f2e6566ef784c1e","852b440374ecc3f77c410f4cdf735219699e1509","1e390cf4ecfeae3c8f22ac73411792e06fb3eb66","aad41c3828185b8d3e89b73867476b63ad0b9383","48fe4acbe59e450e3a86cf709c217493b743a87a","69ab8fe2bdc2b1ea63d86c7fd64142e5d3ed88ec","57ff0a460295045ac543ff1d7f4b8a8711d6932e","343d34eec23377d6745bde10759cbfecf7a22c84","73ccbd14c1c8a928c0dc744129fd106033a30c73","639c5d11e675b0287342399e2094dbe47f9e4b44"],"id":"61344ba701960b3d16e4792216e4b2ef9bc7c570","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/61344ba701960b3d16e4792216e4b2ef9bc7c570","authors":[{"name":"Peilin Yang","ids":["2377909"]},{"name":"Hui Fang","ids":["36162286"]},{"name":"Jimmy Lin","ids":["37752900"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080721"}

Although it is crucial to understand what exactly these needs are in order to be able to meet them, little is currently known about why users visit Wikipedia. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap by combining a survey of Wikipedia readers with a log-based analysis of user activity. Based on an initial series of user surveys, we build a taxonomy of Wikipedia use cases along several dimensions, capturing users\u2019 motivations to visit Wikipedia, the depth of knowledge they are seeking, and their knowledge of the topic of interest prior to visiting Wikipedia. Then, we quantify the prevalence of these use cases via a large-scale user survey conducted on live Wikipedia with almost 30,000 responses. Our analyses highlight the variety of factors driving users to Wikipedia, such as current events, media coverage of a topic, personal curiosity, work or school assignments, or boredom. Finally, we match survey responses to the respondents\u2019 digital traces in Wikipedia\u2019s server logs, enabling the discovery of behavioral patterns associated with specific use cases. For instance, we observe long and fast-paced page sequences across topics for users who are bored or exploring randomly, whereas those using Wikipedia for work or school spend more time on individual articles focused on topics such as science. Our findings advance our understanding of reader motivations and behavior on Wikipedia and can have implications for developers aiming to improve Wikipedia\u2019s user experience, editors striving to cater to their readers\u2019 needs, third-party services (such as search engines) providing access to Wikipedia content, and researchers aiming to build tools such as recommendation engines.","inCitations":["1199d2f096aa4cddb680697b7af601205b9d5a02","c9096e136c3efb5ad47d2d9e02d0c697eb5cdcf5","1e030eee9f983ccb2a86a5a7283ac88a3d6da76b"],"pmid":"","title":"Why We Read Wikipedia","journalPages":"1591-1600","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e00/a45beb1aed9b0c2d4a4e30d2417c094395be.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05379","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05379v2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05379v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052716","http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/wikipedia-www17.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1591.pdf"],"entities":["Behavioral pattern","Digital footprint","Information needs","Randomness","Server (computing)","Taxonomy (general)","Tracing (software)","User experience","Web search engine","Wikipedia","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1cd747045d1460efec2c9865005314d5be151201","3a7b462229f005d66107362fff757a4278cf71ad","26a14cef6fae5a7793d8dbda2c8faf7a89d4ef96","5d9fbab509a8fb09eac6eea88dbb8dcfb646f5df","4c12bf7749dc121a9b3928aaf835b45f329fad6b","467dbcb925f1f197fe74e1ad1f50e3944cd1cadf","a436af29f9adc8e00ae7492a66b4adcc0ec3729e","0706356c9ab6014d6b04577d38289ea8328291a5","c01a400c2890d1fba9284e20cdddeae71f09988e","35996b3a5fb7b28d790160f8217d7ee52f9839ba","a00b8619077492712c0a687765ea161c4c39ed5b","07facb9dd8b7aebe39decdc680c62333aacd5d39","947845a0db0cc83801b27858faf60fe9f92386c8","8385a2213f42ce6750588c2891a0b9bb5d68ae96","7a1a88cf191bfe305c98d867945156591affa9af","189bac143baacb2c5c3c7202fb5523283c4c6826","7d45be0e42cc9b177664755006121d4c96b9e80d","3742c926d8fbf8a74568bd42edb2b3a9630431fe","0ecf8c56300c20622f317e1e6cefdeeb85c513e2","dea266419175e64b5b543bd3b9ef11b52243f4c8","e328414c04d5f715366b72a0e5c5381113db7b44","3f0f0eb4d1d353dcf0fc59b731378cfe9ac41a5d","79b9f9c990cd8469e2d5049cc75d8e9ad2ab3148","42aaec9447a605ecc5f5464a34821195b67b95cc","da9c08584f5a5379eac9f947cf4437d85b919084","33fe586d4bc15111043fc735587b88043513ee5e","386b3303403608c8c70bb501953d6d7984597ac9","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","872ba935b46c94714742aeaef5e38e9db0e2f489","1e9da024e0cb0605eb49c26790367bf0896d2d0c","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7","32d1d24eda58b597a1a3e9d1926a06e47cd0d574","7a3fd27096bcc4847ab560c7bacb778e684ac7ee","3d0a325d82bb116070c6753eb5899eb44d0fca47","61d57780bf480faafe32dfbe157b257407ba2ef8"],"id":"284c58a7ae16b2e6b5ce7e8e53274d8639b836cb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/284c58a7ae16b2e6b5ce7e8e53274d8639b836cb","authors":[{"name":"Philipp Singer","ids":["40338437"]},{"name":"Florian Lemmerich","ids":["2101037"]},{"name":"Robert West","ids":["46379321"]},{"name":"Leila Zia","ids":["2538277"]},{"name":"Ellery Wulczyn","ids":["2618745"]},{"name":"Markus Strohmaier","ids":["1743043"]},{"name":"Jure Leskovec","ids":["1702139"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052716"}

On social media, for example, hundreds of millions of people are publicly reporting about the actions they take and the situations they are in, and an increasing range of events and activities experienced in their lives over time.

In this paper, we show that different input features and hardware settings necessitate different main-memory hash join models. Subsequently, we identify four particular models by which hash-based join algorithms can be executed and propose a novel polymorphic paradigm that dynamically subscribes to the best model given workload and hardware characteristics. We refer to our polymorphic paradigm as PolyHJ and suggest a corresponding implementation, which consists of two mechanisms, namely, in-place, cache-aware partitioning (ICP) and collaborative building and probing (ColBP). ICP and ColBP serve substantially in reducing multi-core cache misses, memory bandwidth usage, and cross-socket traffic. Our experimental results demonstrate that PolyHJ can successfully select the right models for the tested workloads and significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art hash-based join schemes.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"PolyHJ: A Polymorphic Main-Memory Hash Join Paradigm for Multi-Core Machines","journalPages":"1323-1332","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271680","https://web2.qatar.cmu.edu/~mhhammou/polyhj.pdf"],"entities":["Aggregate data","CPU cache","Computer data storage","Database","Extensibility","Hash join","Hash table","In-place algorithm","Join (SQL)","Memory bandwidth","Model selection","Multi-core processor","Programming paradigm","Relational algebra","Scalability","Unique key"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a64c1dbee127baeefca332ef9cc43d1d43819786","a70c18d74fc68ed036e8f615d01022a97283e4b8","4cd80895d1455620af9b76c9ffba64a634c2c1cf","4c43ed595916beefce10118692a581472cf7a29a","11c116b2750e064ce32b3b8de8760234de508314","1ab74d44982409beeca21efb2dbcb97a5c7de4b2","7afe6271e3c345f0a1b60ab458c0de2e3ef940d5","12c2693c5e27a301a030933822c1c6da1558c267","28ecdc50beb098d9176d992fed80eb2bac5963a4","08639cd6b89ac8f375cdc1076b9485ac9d657083","2c5b8766a1dae62b86ba38013253ab8673f6ec44","38e9685ee3305c525d0fe9082f4d58dab78cd6b7","988cb03fbe7169eb0a41e18e03c511b94f15d92d","4eec0e89509a1b0db15eb830799bb62498fdeb1b","daa025155e6ff5a8f817dbb63830789cb339b291","d92cecb07a82dbf1c92a71edcd53a14089b9d0ae","6e93ab1d093dc7716380b79b178269eb95bf14a7","5a49c1c694028fd6ca7acc6af601c0f54efa0700","d11e4070375762e3b6714fe989a7e76df28f7516","1b6623b5a5fa52f3734916019bcea583e884b94f","15b7c7dbfece993f16054d1feaa8e141f59bc427","32d355a7a20f92ccda0608f83d7456870231c570","57c8d1799416ea8aff89146fefd97239ebefafcf"],"id":"880beca3d40bd4b72f1b207772d7617f538bace6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/880beca3d40bd4b72f1b207772d7617f538bace6","authors":[{"name":"Omar Khattab","ids":["1767009"]},{"name":"Mohammad Hammoud","ids":["2499630"]},{"name":"Shanhu Wu","ids":["51504970"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271680"}

Conventional search engines are powerful at answering open domain queries but are mostly capable of stateless search. In this paper, we define a conversational query as a query that depends on the context of the current conversation, and we formulate the conversational query understanding problem as context-aware query reformulation, where the goal is to reformulate the conversational query into a search engine friendly query in order to satisfy users\u2019 information needs in conversational settings. Such context-aware query reformulation problem lends itself to sequence to sequence modeling. We present a large scale open domain dataset of conversational queries and various sequence to sequence models that are learned from this dataset. The best model correctly reformulates over half of all conversational queries, showing the potential of sequence to sequence modeling for this task.","inCitations":["330c5eaca3bcc4a431cbd57c610f2096055782a1","ff76b79ae2dba7ac8ee2cd9c0324fce03b68bc91","4ea92f2ddbb7ce610c6e80377e61397bad7309ff","336ab175d11e821a5085602ba6d58d67c3ea4e35"],"pmid":"","title":"Conversational Query Understanding Using Sequence to Sequence Modeling","journalPages":"1715-1724","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cab5/fbb2b1c245e1d99542e8ef54e4faf846e3da.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186083","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/www_published_rpsr1234-renA.pdf"],"entities":["Brown Corpus","Deep learning","Entity","Home automation","Information needs","Natural language processing","Paging","Pointer (computer programming)","Stateless protocol","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8ff93cfd37dced279134c9d642337a2085b31f59","fa9890e7fca761f164ab8112e1699154d67bc635","b9d220520a5da7d302107aacfe875b8e2977fdbe","581082bf235f70ea070201839d7b8223a0cbf321","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","5247a6e3a60ff0381355e66bfc313bf27512ae0c","0ddc065cc92046857d35555c3af4ade1310aca4a","2279b6c32509eeb47184c7fa468cae1e84da24eb","de0c30321b22c56d637e7c29cb59180f157272a8","2df630cf3387fe3be404d9642c7fa3fb5ebb08f5","06d51deada6e771a2571807a47dd991120c8dd1a","160ec59f2eb9def5cca00f6c1bf198d13fb8b6a7","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","4685abbbefccf769cc09964c6956638a7bfcf132","55b81991fbb025038d98e8c71acf7dc2b78ee5e9","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","22ca497e24466737981f9ca1690d6c712b7e1276","2a738a4ea894874b408533f3d7452f1e1e1b1ef2","02463e0d580803dca65a48e7fb3d6f407d3d1512","00f31994c123fbceba5d5a0e06bb78aff651aae7","0662db8ec063f14507b43e4f93884c0d0e051d68","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","864b8efebc69c91058023463a126d1f344bbaa8a","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","9886b789ed6120267c1ba27c83fad24178ae7a26","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","1b1df9f75ee6f27433687dad302387f811dab64d","1d2f1af1c0b15c4236c026006a5adaa9a944738a","e2efefbba8bf3e76605db24da0ba15df7b0adc9e","0c49eb69e07339881d71c76ee9c0fec528f0fcf4","289e3e6b84982eb65aea8e3a64f2f6916c98e87e","681387f73200127cce575ebab182f093b63c273b"],"id":"cab5fbb2b1c245e1d99542e8ef54e4faf846e3da","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cab5fbb2b1c245e1d99542e8ef54e4faf846e3da","authors":[{"name":"Gary Ren","ids":["40915255"]},{"name":"Xiaochuan Ni","ids":["2116909"]},{"name":"Manish Malik","ids":["49012616"]},{"name":"Qifa Ke","ids":["2259786"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186083"}

Modelling phenomena such as social contagion and information diffusion are contingent upon a detailed understanding of the information-sharing processes. In Twitter, an important aspect of this occurs with retweets, where users rebroadcast the tweets of other users. To improve our understanding of how these distributions arise, we analyse the distribution of retweet times. We show that a power law with exponential cutoff provides a better fit than the power laws previously suggested. We explain this fit through the burstiness of human behaviour and the priorities individuals place on different tasks.","inCitations":["5dee5359e44dfcc8c2fdeb7a5bf7578ee1f8294d","8d7607b5bc6b1627f30d61976ef543a990a15cac"],"pmid":"","title":"The Nature and Origin of Heavy Tails in Retweet Activity","journalPages":"1493-1498","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e641/0ead43b0696739301da21ebb7ed03281764b.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1493.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3041021.3053903","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05545v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05545"],"entities":["Contingency (philosophy)","Social media","Tails","Time complexity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["30d86861c64b9f8173d41e9999dfef77de7ccdd5","14af018e67a16b20a12acb311f4881cc2f257ee9","d2350bf3f42c440212075148a6a04c4642d77799","e97ec3738ef0819b51d9b6c74bdd1f9771367d52","119a67a62b0e9351e4348d234d9eae4c84f366a3","2628a4ab8be64bdc71d6cf9d537586d28053db86","5e2cc34a069c832e71036eb4efc3ff82e448f5a9","16dde76c2ecc94c34004c640f603a8920c2fe1be","6f1e2c8c929c6e348e171a0c5f166a9e39b41615","89f6a6229b3477e6372d534ed836617b5d0d1af9","055960432e6931c78627984b80b1e33b325383eb","0bb7b5098d30b10422c2e52462f5152696390c3a","037c6a50a4a7cae1998d944ae2991c986731912a","08bf35375abf366869446bb33dab26fd95303ff3","b9a3677b42eadd3cef6b1e53d6cdc79e0f28ad7a","6ce18f996c5d8fb6855fdcf256ec0915ec7523aa","022122965312bc4e3525cecf0726551cb27b339f","058ada9d78c689e03ea898008e2bcebf69910d4f"],"id":"817ffe24ce5e9283c592a71f2e6e327f5a6e2a47","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/817ffe24ce5e9283c592a71f2e6e327f5a6e2a47","authors":[{"name":"Peter Mathews","ids":["4849460"]},{"name":"Lewis Mitchell","ids":["13568600"]},{"name":"Giang T.

Various network embedding methods have been proposed, but they are only designed for a single network scenario. In the era of big data, different types of related information can be fused together to form a coupled heterogeneous network, which consists of two different but related sub-networks connected by inter-network edges. In this scenario, the inter-network edges can act as comple- mentary information in the presence of intra-network ones. This complementary information is important because it can make latent features more comprehensive and accurate. And it is more important when the intra-network edges are ab- sent, which can be referred to as the cold-start problem. In this paper, we thus propose a method named embedding of embedding (EOE) for coupled heterogeneous networks. In the EOE, latent features encode not only intra-network edges, but also inter-network ones. To tackle the challenge of heterogeneities of two networks, the EOE incorporates a harmonious embedding matrix to further embed the em- beddings that only encode intra-network edges. Empirical experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the EOE outperforms consistently single network embedding methods in applications including visualization, link prediction multi-class classification, and multi-label classification.","inCitations":["df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","7ce7f23e5d6aee18e190f74e42041386283edc32","1706a4ef5556ecdd680416d46e033e0476290361","c3d62bcb84fc3a2aa9b8f4691677d7c02738f1bc","db9eeca431c423a644a145f5722019570996ce04","ccd3ede78393628b5f0256ebfccbb4ac293394de","47ce9568ff3e7cdb5bb578ea764122d9d7c74bc8","836d3c2f00828b66cd64cf27dc7bcc265f3dedbf","97f1d08c306040401112ff0564f37e6c6a312522","108b9b55f4c839f2c1094d3afb3d85c6f687efd1","7d295804f58733c15c6640c6f12f15e42f5eb3db","8c5c7fe6d59c58e39692ab2bc9d1c95f3644be7a","3fd9403b01989c6e2af5076eec6a67114188d6b9","0cfac458b176a1e81879aff4344c5278114cc171","f421ebe6b502c42820b0d4028304b5843f70def9","24c31f5efe93a6cee2fdd37312faebaf8866b9e7","2633008bab38abb29d0e9588d3ad8f65cce96fcb","149f9475116182c74bab66047aca0797f7bb93fc","e33bc45f9fe1909f939d12e1c48e42909d6df017","63b9f657a3133d62c97eadaf5ed7d6d0c2f5cf3d","7c28b81dff1899e5a148ff57888faacc9945ab22","85b3193e329b7017cde6856b5cbbd3ff6e19f8f9","5ec39dcadbfa096592ac811679c3e1eb8ddff7db","74e34e0e4540e8f5d5fa580f6aba4aa361f95802","682e6605720556305b99ad1379ad9b00a3dd1891","dcdf7774ee9b2de1ec307f2a53e3f44036dff6a1","00e14b6b7fcbe461727dc57975b8b18f92d851fc"],"pmid":"","title":"Embedding of Embedding (EOE): Joint Embedding for Coupled Heterogeneous Networks","journalPages":"741-749","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018723","http://shichuan.org/hin/topic/Embedding/2017.%20WSDM%20Embedding%20of%20Embedding%20EOE%20Joint%20Embedding%20for%20Coupled%20Heterogeneous%20Networks.pdf"],"entities":["Big data","Cold start","ENCODE","Experiment","Linkage (software)","Multi-label classification","Social network analysis"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["231d0ecb5a33eae8495f646a985cc14e209fbfb2","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","0ffef82576452eac1a8e48edaabf08282426d100","67b1b9502fbfe1c13bdf5fb063060f17b92669f8","26742aa25a2790558f840b9551fb1babc4f9e03a","069814b2508f03655b0bf672cf15489ccd408309","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","2317a28a52d8fc9b9d2367831c3a3cd79429e56d","e04108dc293c9cd7cabf32ee1524eaab0d4641b3","78fcb75eba134a720c7bc7d65e42c542a074c256","daf6ddd50515d5408cb9f6183c5d308adee7d521","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","42e8632424b0ead9ff52c3ed1fe5faee1e9e65f4","9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d","20739c96ed44ccfdc5352ea38e1a2a15137363f4","3eaca435527a765572ed04acd06ba512faac89eb","6d8c9fcce8177d6f8d122d653c7d32d7624d6714","2337c65e651a909d7176ee083d368bcb4099b125","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","2414283ed14ebb0eec031bb75cd25fbad000687e","03ce9b83f0b5fe98e5795a909bbf2ef35af0cbf3","3f9df5c77af49d5b1b19eac9b82cb430b50f482d","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","ce578c7ad74b6ef1359cd7aa8cba597af5b30b0a","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2"],"id":"8117433f035c9254e37d316d7b57b1580cff8c5e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8117433f035c9254e37d316d7b57b1580cff8c5e","authors":[{"name":"Linchuan Xu","ids":["8834417"]},{"name":"Xiaokai Wei","ids":["2336542"]},{"name":"Jiannong Cao","ids":["1780398"]},{"name":"Philip S.

Two graphs are constructed based on the modeled source relations, which are further used to derive two aspects of source reliability via random walk computation.","inCitations":["a167bfd52d17baca47f6431cb6621cb93ae93e21","29a1406a840e43bb5e8a47191be0b6cdc26b7a31"],"pmid":"","title":"Value Veracity Estimation for Multi-Truth Objects via a Graph-Based Approach","journalPages":"777-778","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a240/e76d7552960f0a48c37f11c8f948327aa20a.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p777.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054212"],"entities":["Computation","Veracity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["579e1e9217cfed6d563cedf8f8fdcd1604fc0917","61dc7b3bcdff4e0fec03880ee079ae06f8fe32f9","f94350a59508ce0175e33b3427ff0dd92ccc9abf"],"id":"a240e76d7552960f0a48c37f11c8f948327aa20a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a240e76d7552960f0a48c37f11c8f948327aa20a","authors":[{"name":"Xiu Susie Fang","ids":["35060091"]},{"name":"Quan Z.

Citation contexts are especially useful for recommendation and summarization tasks. However, few studies have recognized the diversity of these citation contexts, thus leading to redundant recommendation lists and abstract [3]. To address this gap, we compared several strategies that can recommend a set of diverse citation contexts by re-ranking extracted citation contexts. Diversification was achieved by combining one of two semantic distance algorithms with one of two re-ranking algorithms. Experimenting with CiteSeerX dataset, our program produced a diverse list of 10 citation contexts that could be recommended to users. We evaluated the experiment results based on a user case study of 15 articles. The case study revealed that a diversity strategy that combined the \"ESA\" and \"MMR\" led to a better reading experience for participants compared to other diversity strategies. Our study provides insights to develop better automatic academic recommendation and summarization systems.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Diversifying Citation Contexts in Academic Literature for Knowledge Recommendation","journalPages":"397-398","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3197026.3203904"],"entities":["Algorithm","CiteSeerX","Diversification (finance)","ESA","Experiment","Meet-me room"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f18b1aca58e83f462fe62535feee901ddacb70de","c669c8cb28c6d219419e0e904a795164e8c6be05","20eadc7ef4613465f1fa088a3c26ee4123050e42","ab2c5c145dc93c5f707fe1bc5b44a9727e95ab01"],"id":"8161e9a9a29a8adff5a7c60104582f26ff203097","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8161e9a9a29a8adff5a7c60104582f26ff203097","authors":[{"name":"Yunhan Yang","ids":["46173238"]},{"name":"Haihua Chen","ids":["1789852"]},{"name":"Wei Lu","ids":["48628006"]},{"name":"Brenda Reyes Ayala","ids":["10341321"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3197026.3203904"}

This is while people are able to assess the relevance quite well, though unfamiliar topics and complex documents can defeat them. This assessment may require the ability to understand language, images, document structure, videos, audio, and functional elements. In turn, understanding of these elements is built on background information about the world, such as human behavior patterns, and even more fundamental truths such as the existence of time, space, and people. All this comes naturally to people, but not to computers.\n Recently, large-scale machine learning has altered the landscape. Deep learning has greatly advanced machine understanding of images and language. Since document and query understanding incorporate these elements, deep learning can hold great promise. But it comes with a drawback: general purpose representations (like CNNs for images) have proved somewhat elusive for text. In particular, embeddings act as a distributed representation not just of semantic information but also application-specific learning, which are hard to transfer. In short, conditions seem right for a renewed attempt on the fundamental document understanding problem.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Toward Document Understanding for Information Retrieval","journalPages":"27-31","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3190580.3190585","http://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/p027.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial intelligence","Artificial neural network","Computer","Deep learning","Document","Functional programming","Information retrieval","Machine learning","Natural language understanding","Relevance","Video"],"journalVolume":"51","outCitations":[],"id":"613df8d7b11c40840b5ec68e364e9098a5942e12","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/613df8d7b11c40840b5ec68e364e9098a5942e12","authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Dehghani","ids":["3226635"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3190580.3190585"}

Existing XKS engines primarily suffer from two limitations. First, although the smallest lowest common ancestor (SLCA) algorithm (or a variant, e.g., ELCA) is widely accepted as a meaningful way to identify subtrees containing the query keywords, SLCA typically performs poorly on documents with missing elements, i.e., (sub)elements that are optional, or appear in some instances of an element type but not all. Second, since keyword search can be ambiguous with multiple possible interpretations, it is desirable for an XKS engine to automatically expand the original query by providing a classification of different possible interpretations of the query w.r.t. the original results. However, existing XKS systems do not support such result-based query expansion. We demonstrate ASTERIX, an innovative XKS engine that addresses these limitations.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"ASTERIX: Ambiguity and Missing Element-Aware XML Keyword Search Engine","journalPages":"1317-1320","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3084137"],"entities":["Display resolution","Information retrieval","Lowest common ancestor","Query expansion","Search algorithm","Tree (data structure)","XML"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1061266cf0b9559f71f6504140cb484c1581b2db","8f3e6b67550bb47013172604991660bae87a6350","f445f1e2b0883f4da1e1e65c0babdba3f6d1867c","3ea9d5c4570ac36ddb97bc6c045cfe4ff893293a","03705c70a497d84acd67ca9a6646940b59f54600","e1f3c9b4da3c84ef47d357140e842d44056c8a98","1ab0d9bdbe71aaf878fa8707ce2526cb86a137ee","19c359e82b3d577b05253b1ef58575fa26f32464","8408e48579aae25dddcac7f6f337a5bbbb5c21ad","4f6f24f2364ab12d582c5e2c1620e6bd4992862d","33eccded784116196e60d4ebcfeeb170075608cd"],"id":"0f3ba1a0ba862e4b29cdfa303e3666ac8b59464d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0f3ba1a0ba862e4b29cdfa303e3666ac8b59464d","authors":[{"name":"Ba Quan Truong","ids":["2368051"]},{"name":"Sourav S.

Email volume optimization approaches published in the past have proposed optimization of email volume for maximization of engagement metrics which are impacted exclusively by email; for example, the number of sessions that begin with clicks on links within emails. The impact of email on such downstream engagement metrics can be estimated easily because of the ease of attribution of such an engagement event to an email. However, this framework is limited in its view of the ecosystem of the networking service which comprises of several tools and utilities that contribute towards delivering value to members; with email being just one such utility. Thus, in this paper we depart from previous approaches by exploring and optimizing the contribution of email to this ecosystem. In particular, we present and contrast the differential impact of email on sitewide engagement metrics for various types of users. We propose a new email volume optimization approach which maximizes sitewide engagement metrics, such as the total number of active users. This is in sharp contrast to the previous approaches whose objective has been maximization of downstream engagement metrics. We present details of our prediction function for predicting the impact of emails on a user's activeness on the mobile or web application. We describe how certain approximations to this prediction function can be made for solving the volume optimization problem, and present results from online A/B tests.","inCitations":["59e1a2eece344d31f129fa65496c3aac74c88189","53383efb32a39d470f0cd3776ff8716d26ef0bd8"],"pmid":"","title":"Optimizing Email Volume For Sitewide Engagement","journalPages":"1947-1955","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132849"],"entities":["A/B testing","Approximation","Daily active users","Downstream (software development)","Ecosystem","Email","Entropy maximization","Experiment","Mathematical optimization","Multi-objective optimization","Optimization problem","Optimizing compiler","Page view","Seamless3d","Web application"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["bb07ff4b407a48436624837e9547c43501530475","bf88f2e727c95ec3e23a85375e4344f55b9fd7bf","396030e4838ab208638fc7e466223ab666fb6284","f7cc80bd2c510820b6febac3ad5e91c0f6c96989"],"id":"fcf5b78780bfcdbf2fe919bb786d5a5d6e703838","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fcf5b78780bfcdbf2fe919bb786d5a5d6e703838","authors":[{"name":"Rupesh Gupta","ids":["49007330"]},{"name":"Guanfeng Liang","ids":["1783212"]},{"name":"Rómer Rosales","ids":["4041437"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132849"}

In literature, Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is commonly used to create feature vectors for such tasks. However, TF-IDF formulation does not utilize the class information available in supervised learning. For classification problems, if it is possible to identify terms that can strongly distinguish among classes, then more weight can be given to those terms during feature construction phase. This may result in improved classifier performance with the incorporation of extra class label related information. We propose a supervised feature construction method to classify tweets, based on the actionable information that might be present, posted during different disaster scenarios. Improved classifier performance for such classification tasks can be helpful in the rescue and relief operations. We used three benchmark datasets containing tweets posted during Nepal and Italy earthquakes in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains better classification performance on these benchmark datasets.","inCitations":["be3e126ab39fefcec41a6bb559622db127eae505","a109c23c0343bf1690153f8204160a4fe257ac3c"],"pmid":"","title":"Class Specific TF-IDF Boosting for Short-text Classification: Application to Short-texts Generated During Disasters","journalPages":"1629-1637","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ca9d/4f4079b77e4a86169a32525d5d802c106f8d.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3191621","https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/kripa/smerp2018/samujjwalGhosh.pdf"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Document classification","Feature vector","Multi-label classification","Statistical classification","Supervised learning","Tf\u2013idf"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0f6a0295855284d9458afc3840350c252b18dcd4","61130686617e4cb54d5599adce8880609e97c228","e13da78f9be71dca3ade8844ca9c12f0531269e2","a4c34567626b119c3b267c24439a93a439a4dd35","0ae464c769bdefbfdaa793cc70bfc149bf866496","01cfc796d0a375c39aa604461fc8c0c6250c26a9","1507daca3eef3f77d6111a8391d771c14dc52192","390e9808f1499585b4b00cb77d33777f51d6b34b","e3efbbfca015f1b6d1a45612a42735d352bd3b79","c8ba8b5a6182fb2355a274be189db148000678c5","2c62d1cc9363dd1030a064cfde7472a25d00dc12","4e71862aa2891d4ad4067fa7ff0f94e934e5c4fd","4781b899447abc3439eb785281aa754126f1d818","5ef2edfe51d3d768b1d89ad7e74e4ce8e55d1d49","5a8265ea1251d8c08aa82cdd563f728b4c7ec8e8","659557897a9f20953e1a7a0b5a334ad559c46d68","1e080bc653cedcd56c8fc5934bf7e2b74c27f0ca","5b3376b6e37e3bcace4f216c9f681101e665d170","a78d7a76ee6bf9483b4e6935b8aa668ab526eba0","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","6fc0643dd1710bd0125966d0f0af67bc21942c40"],"id":"ca9d4f4079b77e4a86169a32525d5d802c106f8d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ca9d4f4079b77e4a86169a32525d5d802c106f8d","authors":[{"name":"Samujjwal Ghosh","ids":["40975611"]},{"name":"Maunendra Sankar Desarkar","ids":["2481485"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3191621"}

More crucially, these approaches only recommend queries that are a coarse approximation of the information a user needs to complete their goal. They do not directly attempt to model the need and generate recommendations from it.

Often followed strategies, such as recommending popular items are inadequate for this vertical because of two reasons. Firstly, users have their own personal preference over items, referred to as personal styles, which lead to the long-tail phenomenon. Secondly, each user displays multiple personas, each persona has a preference over items which could be dictated by a particular occasion, e.g. dressing for a party would be different from dressing to go to office. Recommendation in this vertical is crucially dependent on discovering styles for each of the multiple personas. There is no literature which addresses this problem.\n We posit a generative model which describes each user by a Simplex Over PERsona, SOPER, where a persona is described as the individuals preferences over prevailing styles modelled as topics over items. The choice of simplex and the long-tail nature necessitates the use of stick-breaking process. The main technical contribution is an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling based algorithm for solving the attendant inference problem.\n Trained on large-scale interaction logs spanning more than half-a-million sessions collected from an e-commerce portal, SOPER outperforms previous baselines such as [9] by a large margin of 35% in identifying persona. Consequently it outperforms several competitive baselines comprehensively on the task of recommending from a catalogue of roughly 150 thousand lifestyle articles, by improving the recommendation quality as measured by AUC by a staggering 12.23%, in addition to aiding the interpretability of uncovered personal and fashionable styles thus advancing our precise understanding of the underlying phenomena.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"SOPER: Discovering the Influence of Fashion and the Many Faces of User from Session Logs using Stick Breaking Process","journalPages":"1609-1618","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://nmrinl.github.io/cikm17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133007"],"entities":["Algorithm","Competitive learning","E-commerce","File spanning","Generative model","Gibbs sampling","Goto","Long tail","Machine learning","Persona (user experience)","Sampling (signal processing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["45eb843f82c166c7ed1d5c7a94b4f85d441c92e6","22bf66441dd0fb73e4d8563ddd56c962bfd38735","6a94f16627379a7163f39a5b909c41b5167d3889","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","8c5442756d8e7110b3cfec0f366f502d82bfe835","9b7a6c96daf95289fac40c8fd76bb13a7a89bec0","10b2bbbe320b9e4523cf94835e2cb8878541d9fd","b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d","4f0f9085460fd383c9cab2b3f63f962303cd7b01","84dcd5357f0757211a9f3031365d258ebbcd9e60","763caad351b26a0c18cc2a363e67c738ad4071fc","6c0a7b47f223b60e45e7f4cb55412b23edb4e43f","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","5170e44c954179768fce6c7d8b1d5f635dc1d9ba","24dcd4bbfa790ddb96631a8877b373abb388f41d","45db16309fbf7e9fc8907047e7e1a9933c4e1b85"],"id":"d0714578256f548edd8390f4719a210aa8193143","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d0714578256f548edd8390f4719a210aa8193143","authors":[{"name":"Lucky Dhakad","ids":["28115301"]},{"name":"Mrinal Kanti Das","ids":["12417163"]},{"name":"Chiranjib Bhattacharyya","ids":["4084728"]},{"name":"Samik Datta","ids":["1945860"]},{"name":"Mihir Kale","ids":["26688118"]},{"name":"Vivek Mehta","ids":["47550505"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133007"}

Tens of thousands of SLRs are published each year, and this rate is growing across all fields of science. Performing an accurate, complete and unbiased SLR is however a difficult and expensive endeavor. This is true in general for all phases of a literature review, and in particular for the paper screening phase, where authors filter a set of potentially in-scope papers based on a number of exclusion criteria. To address the problem, in recent years the research community has began to explore the use of the crowd to allow for a faster, accurate, cheaper and unbiased screening of papers. Initial results show that crowdsourcing can be effective, even for relatively complex reviews. In this paper we derive and analyze a set of strategies for crowdbased screening, and show that an adaptive strategy, that continuously re-assesses the statistical properties of the problem to minimize the number of votes needed to take decisions for each paper, significantly outperforms a number of non-adaptive approaches in terms of cost and accuracy. We validate both applicability and results of the approach through a set of crowdsourcing experiments, and discuss properties of the problem and algorithms that we believe to be generally of interest for classification problems where items are classified via a series of successive tests (as it often happens in medicine).","inCitations":["5e93b8402a237b2a065fa08e2bcfe9c8deff9d28","45d23dad53c9410ac48a6cc02b51f59ba8c9ea4a","78ae216c99e8f650a3d1e87e574b669fb085ca43"],"pmid":"","title":"Crowd-based Multi-Predicate Screening of Papers in Literature Reviews","journalPages":"55-64","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/78e3/c3b5c7f8ff6d3dcdd9b07f4d757ec0b185a9.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09814","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09814v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186036"],"entities":["Algorithm","Crowdsourcing","Digital single-lens reflex camera","Experiment","Virtual screening"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["fbb11a841893d4b68fa2173226285ded4f7b04d6","acaab60052084e6dfe74333c8a9863a366946219","2a5c1b5db3c43897fd0c592946caa20bd1f41249","92e5852ecc8076460b86c83c06e9374e38b054d8","bd4aabac138e052c58a3d449e1593ceb51544983","760ceccb48f43ca2d33a324ae4f6ae9d15a9210d","59f36008e56daaa6b8959ba5142fce717b7c3446","4b52ad1c65b5f61fd9f7f1d040dc13d80be8d07e","33d65cb3e2e852a5618e9432c2d067f47ab09832","95092f376ebcd064cdc213008150eb649f4f2149","b8c4f65e20e2b48d03cfec92b87036c5e0f1bef1","58e88a0af306070186beabec8a46f9321e2866e0","42edbefd93ee1190074009d6acc7d75b4b20c852","ba24bd33caaa38127664f86d1bb486ac508b8a47","52327eecb10930640e23ef36bb7845d1a090e091","bd5b9c8ef53bc8ff29441a0aa832851171c211bf","6953420c593842697dd09bc2cf7ffbbaf67a6e8e","413011851895daa1ffad9dbe347443f807388223","7ac5425b837a5e889847afdaf04c0241b9b0b4ba","e484551654defa1384f1a5bc85d7d9ff9364eb7d","b95f1ffd27ee92ee100415b20797ca86b44b9e42","ebe8ef2379254942ef08a15c13cb5173a6c9ef12","1b21b8b0fb70a119e6b6699646a04ccc414796b4","28e1aed35363cf1491b82cb1f0efef4bb91f1613","5791d4c1b6f67c003915ef1ddc2da473512a32cf","27dc15a7f2370d45a2aa4084b69dbfb0c9a74569","3ce6db01cbd1889aabd1330ffce38760d2f92bb8","169404f79e4453fbad46a6c24e17e081aa44fefd","2bd606524bf6d2ca734bd35b668364991165bfe1","39ed53a942033d7d84e520bffde543477dddc3e7","6f4099f75e08246a4908e9bed6eacb477c9bb0f8","5ee02059d69961bb8e65677e0a45e7013fbc228f","1513d2315fbd7eeecbae7f1508689bcffea95386","5ee10470eafea6bc6a6dc4fcb3e5c76a5efc2c61","b0f282a100eb13f5bc89b13f8969433e9ce252d6","0304ad34094b3cc8f888f2f2ad04ad6d5f0150e7","50ce6c3c3e27be8bf91eb1f39d814e8a58beb5c0","26e8f3cc46b710a013358bf0289df4de033446ba","044bed1b54802096c8d80d36329e9a1b0c611216"],"id":"78e3c3b5c7f8ff6d3dcdd9b07f4d757ec0b185a9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/78e3c3b5c7f8ff6d3dcdd9b07f4d757ec0b185a9","authors":[{"name":"Evgeny Krivosheev","ids":["26436914"]},{"name":"Fabio Casati","ids":["1771727"]},{"name":"Boualem Benatallah","ids":["1734279"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186036"}

This problem is encountered in a wide array of applications---from biological networks to social networks to ontologies---where multiple networked data sources need to be integrated. Due to the difficulty of the task, an accurate alignment can rarely be found without human assistance. Thus, it is of great practical importance to develop network alignment algorithms that can optimally leverage experts who are able to provide the correct alignment for a small number of nodes. Yet, only a handful of existing works address this active network alignment setting.\n The majority of the existing active methods focus on absolute queries (\"are nodes a and b the same or not?\"), whereas we argue that it is generally easier for a human expert to answer relative queries (\"which node in the set b1,...,bn is the most similar to node a?\"). This paper introduces two novel relative-query strategies, TopMatchings and GibbsMatchings, which can be applied on top of any network alignment method that constructs and solves a bipartite matching problem. Our methods identify the most informative nodes to query by sampling the matchings of the bipartite graph associated to the network-alignment instance.\n We compare the proposed approaches to several commonly-used query strategies and perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our sampling-based strategies yield the highest overall performance, outperforming all the baseline methods by more than 15 percentage points in some cases. In terms of accuracy, TopMatchings and GibbsMatchings perform comparably. However, GibbsMatchings is significantly more scalable, but it also requires hyperparameter tuning for a temperature parameter.","inCitations":["d41fcc7b44ee8750fc7b8634189311eb72800d6a","b09c860bc89adf5aee24237fdd7d0e6e176ffe5f","87857642a2dbfdd18e45354d6b7ce2cb321c79c4"],"pmid":"","title":"Active Network Alignment: A Matching-Based Approach","journalPages":"1687-1696","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05516v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05516v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05516","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132983","https://uk.arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05516.pdf"],"entities":["Active networking","Algorithm","Assistive technology","Baseline (configuration management)","Biological network","Computation","Experiment","Feedback","Information","Matching (graph theory)","Ontology (information science)","Performance tuning","Sampling (signal processing)","Scalability","Social network","Synthetic intelligence"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b4f10bab6edf7f743a0ddfeca18d45bdcf0037fd","215f6290ae24284f8f2b141267f895346f8350fd","aba09ce7859301e46a163d015a4ca4c5aba8c040","b405834eb7d76d54cc725d9473c3efc176097c27","009dada3fe1385a3987d72cb96d01447eef715ff","f3ab61d9faace6cfffcfc89503c0b804206d9641","36991543a67e1b0b4cfe4a08749e3da18ba80ebd","8c8337d10e2d71e3d7da43c8bc8d9abe5c631e9c","7d8418e5910943155075fd3acc3167f0429ce215","2c678353af4b4e5782d5b1ab979f308c66a79cb9","7b59ee67771b7bff75df7f253f14626bb36a7907","6a64285a5d6c16b38ac0f8b471559cf8484a3078","0eaf5ee75ca8f5284d167ae2751e843f1d03f90c","39f4757209ae338af430648d1a178068c22097db","32d12b621e75cdb5942896c16421496bdfd4a6fa","06be6eb9585d070c979f89ae19fe84fe4ab355a1","8c81ddd9c1a6f0d44851c0d2f7f6c4d28ba38382","0c7631885b5d3e486742c3dd83ed747caab2df8e","07afc9b626379e3ace940714d9a58fcd5326f82b","6bb52100d7da8655eeae36dca21c3abecf151272","8fdd71b6af75e71d4bcca20eb3defc6ce4424237","7ee3a70c5400e64778271ac508a0611ac7d4bcf1","dc10351066a55b22f7cf45c1cf1e8e7b1f8f4cd1","2628a4ab8be64bdc71d6cf9d537586d28053db86","038f34c6af7c0c1fcea96d3061ea13bd7440d8d2","28c4843bc6cf19eb6ba7816ab1b926702b4c7721","a4821429078c0d174a2deb0ec06406d59914abdf","2cba31c4cca2d50ea2af2e54bc7cfb2872ffacdf","53987d229586c8457c716a4dd831d9cee9890921","1d8f2b0292f4b6080a5db2470580273757ba4a70","6a27d9932b947fcf1578856e65ab93fbb3b0af6d","2127e2287e5bd68cfa9a27c621c40b19a7846a5f","818826f356444f3daa3447755bf63f171f39ec47","3f352f7fe973e4c2382a53a46bdce2da73413cf3"],"id":"29324ba1a3a6aeb3db4ae5cfdd19253f48fc96dc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/29324ba1a3a6aeb3db4ae5cfdd19253f48fc96dc","authors":[{"name":"Eric Malmi","ids":["3288074"]},{"name":"Aristides Gionis","ids":["1682878"]},{"name":"Evimaria Terzi","ids":["1839624"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132983"}

This could be an end of story, especially if we were not computer scientists Who are making those advertisements and why? As we know that the television networks make money by broadcasting tv commercial to their viewers. They use the money to create contents and make profit. Therefore, it is obvious that we watch commercial to watch their shows. Of course, some ad-free television networks make funds from monthly subscription fee. But why do we feel that we see more ads online than before? Are we right about it? The answer is Yes. We are seeing more ads than before and it is not only because we spend more time online but also because more marketing money has shifted from offline to online marketing. The increase in digital marketing is due to several reasons; 1) increase of time spent online 2) descent of publishers' offline business 3) innovations in digital advertising technology and creatives.

Our model captures the sequential influences of products by transforming the historical purchase records into a product graph. Then the product can be transformed into a low dimensional vector by the network embedding model. Once products are projected into the latent space, we present a novel method to compute user's latest preferences, which projects users into the same latent space as products. This method is based on time-decay functions and the embedding of sequential products that the user purchased. Thus, relatedness between a product and a user can be measured by the similarity between the embedding vectors which represent the product and the user's preferences. The experimental results on purchase records crawled from JINGDONG, show the superiority of our proposed framework for personalized product recommendation.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Learning Graph-based Embedding For Time-Aware Product Recommendation","journalPages":"2163-2166","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133060"],"entities":["Association rule learning","Feature learning","Graph embedding","Machine learning","Parser Grammar Engine","Personalization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2c1efbf45af92f54adf0501c4080195bf28954c8","34b49026d61b3c308bce9ba5cf4ae8305f09d0e2","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","1908f376b73f9726325300bcd90a6780503d084c","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","6269b1d962a42c9ad0133875b1726c8269f83860","599ebeef9c9d92224bc5969f3e8e8c45bff3b072","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","8101b548f5b2eae2591dfdd989f6c15b9a4cdefb"],"id":"210244be454bd0caa9727082047cc07f54955a6f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/210244be454bd0caa9727082047cc07f54955a6f","authors":[{"name":"Yuqi Li","ids":["50023941"]},{"name":"Weizheng Chen","ids":["2541846"]},{"name":"Hongfei Yan","ids":["2153973"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133060"}

Despite extensive research, we realize that efficient use of topological and attribute information for large attributed network alignment has not been sufficiently addressed in previous studies. In this paper, based on Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and Dirichlet-multinomial, we propose \"divide-and-conquer\" models CAlign that jointly consider network alignment, community discovery and community alignment in one framework for large networks with node attributes, in an effort to reduce both the computation time and memory usage while achieving better or competitive performance. It is provable that the algorithms derived from our model have sub-quadratic time complexity and linear space complexity on a network with small densification power, which is true for most real-world networks. Experiments show CAlign is superior to two recent state-of-art models in terms of accuracy, time and memory on large networks, and CAlign is capable of handling millions of nodes on a modern desktop machine.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Community-Based Network Alignment for Large Attributed Network","journalPages":"587-596","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132904"],"entities":["Algorithm","Computation","DSPACE","Desktop computer","Experiment","Multinomial logistic regression","Provable security","Stochastic block model","Super Bit Mapping","Time complexity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["321c38a8259ce320f6ce1febeb3aacc7498342c5","91d297a21c2a29a08104455340c21d637e2ee036","8c81ddd9c1a6f0d44851c0d2f7f6c4d28ba38382","c73a1ee22c605341cd1218853d4680f2a879229b","897391c58a60d3e33697e3486800dbb5183d2b65","480c75d9674cebda4b2e65309b791e078e580e27","9ceeaa46e727a1f11321b1b0a486a036e1ea4497","06944f857ee89121776d9d173e48b6588c0b1553","a71f6d2d49eda16193bf5578662c11d3ed986355","fc824f83d41c1f549312cc4296eb9dcab4ad0033","797928abfe0d189383325fe6322ced2226bcd457","b9b5cc6566159f150662dc5e051f6f13c12841ce","2043d02cf26da6d4ba99a60461a8018b4aa0e50e","8c8337d10e2d71e3d7da43c8bc8d9abe5c631e9c","30cb434e7955f48145a10b7306c94c0433f8443e","1a51e5c06e141eb23ec17071b681155332f1d22e","996263c3ddbb50f0198354827445abd214f83030","15973b0bfdbe84d1cb6e2a35fc857a1d125a3923","0a2b0c431bd68c6a67926f44a07a0d575f2957f1","189ef562597987ef484b43ff2c9d3fca6b797309","ad90445eb2b6615174981e3c36c9aa25754276b8","ed7bedbb44140c8947ed16fc23e8a74fde5fdc20","5ac20145c5d662320cdc55acd185626defe03c7d","40922ef4df50dc1fea9d8eeb5e209325641857ab","0f0809e6537e5ffe212190c243a249382f5ffab1","24a9e0ac9bbc708efd14512becc5c4514d8f042d","6780823d309a4a96fd4fcab53544bb8724bf461b","5fa73d8be25bf1132964f3abc361c60c1eb4c7ec","775e5727f5df0cb9bf834af2ea2548a696c27a38"],"id":"a1c2eb1e881d8b41faee3da6f41920f036ccacf4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a1c2eb1e881d8b41faee3da6f41920f036ccacf4","authors":[{"name":"Zheng Chen","ids":["46842748"]},{"name":"Xinli Yu","ids":["28064618"]},{"name":"Bo Song","ids":["3626300"]},{"name":"Jianliang Gao","ids":["3062346"]},{"name":"Xiaohua Hu","ids":["1684511"]},{"name":"Wei-Shih Yang","ids":["3041246"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132904"}

RSTPP addresses two key challenges: 1) Data scarcity due to uneven distribution of check-ins among users/locations. 2) User trajectories contain valuable information that is ignored by standard temporal point process which only considers historical event times. RSTPP is designed to learn the latent dependencies of event times over both historical events and spatio-temporal information about locations a user visited before check-in to the location of interest.

Previously, machine learning methods have been exploited to address the problem, which learns a matching function from labeled data, also referred to as \"learning to match''. In recent years, deep learning has been successfully applied to matching and significant progresses have been made. Deep semantic matching models for search and neural collaborative filtering models for recommendation are becoming the state-of-the-art technologies. The key to the success of the deep learning approach is its strong ability in learning of representations and generalization of matching patterns from raw data (e.g., queries, documents, users, and items, particularly in their raw forms). In this tutorial, we aim to give a comprehensive survey on recent progress in deep learning for matching in search and recommendation. Our tutorial is unique in that we try to give a unified view on search and recommendation. In this way, we expect researchers from the two fields can get deep understanding and accurate insight on the spaces, stimulate more ideas and discussions, and promote developments of technologies. The tutorial mainly consists of three parts. Firstly, we introduce the general problem of matching, which is fundamental in both search and recommendation. Secondly, we explain how traditional machine learning techniques are utilized to address the matching problem in search and recommendation. Lastly, we elaborate how deep learning can be effectively used to solve the matching problems in both tasks.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Deep Learning for Matching in Search and Recommendation","journalPages":"1365-1368","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/sigir18-tutorial-deep-matching.pdf","https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/sigir18-deep.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210181","https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/www18-tutorial-deep-matching.pdf","https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/www18-tutorial-deep-matching-paper.pdf","http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/www18-tutorial-deep-matching.pdf"],"entities":["Collaborative filtering","Deep learning","Document","Information retrieval","Machine learning","Matching (graph theory)","Relevance","Semantic matching"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["07a9478e87a8304fc3267fa16e83e9f3bbd98b27","b44ff5104557fc9b900d48f02605dd42d794927d","4adb97f155fa9ab8a1d3128db4b00a7812349e5b","15f5721502c2905c555a4eb0a110d6fc211c1fb2","657fbf29ea0b4904a3e98d1556f9acf38dddae5f","d5a823053663a77869d4b38a8026c51ebc2e975e","234dc7984668f72ee4917755915040386be4eb1f","151313065d71b49dbf07289c002c887d7b5a0a6b","1942250b72d2a195db11fbadd9ab7ee6a12027a3","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","f0af0029293dc8f242894f113baf15d68228ec4d","0aedae19e94d76520cb92932b6506389799051e2","b7f07166d4fb0d6b09a4a775d5a1b89685cf54c9","23b0a959d07a744a80734119e94262f14f2d83e1","364c1a3df58d87cb40ab33fdf3831cf2862f3570","ea738439b880ad033ff01602ea52d04b366d0d37","22ae02d81c21cb90b0de071550cfb99e6a623e62","3d1f9a530e710fdd4e2313bda4c8a1f574e60ab6","fc981c140ae0331b5ea20f48cb92762d8e8316b9","85c6d5e69de119f4e553b1fbd44508e25e9cfdcf","02121b35aa2c543e6afbd193afb9c929705b7aee","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","167abf2c9eda9ce21907fcc188d2e41da37d9f0b","c58738fade559d02a71bedba51bc62d42587777c","fc3384d631f5e2b2a9d66623d4d3e1d28b96dee7","0beeb77c16e7866a23991f3718b25312af55d3e9","56d03ab8afe62e40c34cfb79607efa1ffac1988c","7a9c4c98e361f3b4f4bfbeea7e6699917ce42091","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","7656cddac460af91919558175063938acfdd813b","9cbf32e778128e1e07e309ec644e1654de9fa98b"],"id":"a01b81eb04b150f39ef102ac11ebdc2de1916946","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a01b81eb04b150f39ef102ac11ebdc2de1916946","authors":[{"name":"Jun Xu","ids":["39474114"]},{"name":"Xiangnan He","ids":["7792071"]},{"name":"Hang Li","ids":["49404233"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210181"}

Researchers and practitioner are continuously trying to devise new methodologies to improve the accuracy of recommendations. Recommendation problem becomes more challenging for sparse binary implicit feedback, due to the absence of explicit signals of interest and sparseness of data. In this paper, we deal with the problem of the sparseness of data and accuracy of recommendations. To address the issue, we propose an interest diffusion methodology in heterogeneous information network for items to be recommended using the meta-information related to items. In this heterogeneous information network, graph regularized interest diffusion is performed to generate personalized recommendations of top-N items. For interest diffusion, personalized weight learning is performed for different meta-information object types in the network.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method to obtain high quality event-related tweets from Twitter stream, in terms of precision and recall. Specifically, candidate event-related tweets are selected based on a set of keywords. We propose to generate and update these keywords dynamically along the event development. To be included in this keyword set, words are evaluated based on single word properties, property based on co-occurred words, and changes of word importance over time. Our solution is capable of capturing keywords of emerging aspects or aspects with increasing importance along event evolvement. By leveraging keyword importance information and a few labeled tweets, we propose a semi-supervised expectation maximization process to identify event-related tweets. This process significantly reduces human effort in acquiring high quality tweets.

Obtaining high quality training data is an important step towards producing an effective multi-community classifier. An efficient approach for creating such ground truth data is to extract users from existing public Twitter lists, where those lists represent different communities, e.g. a list of journalists. However, ground truth datasets obtained using such lists can be noisy, since not all users that belong to a community are good training examples for that community. In this paper, we conduct a thorough failure analysis of a ground truth dataset generated using Twitter lists. We discuss how some categories of users collected from these Twitter public lists could negatively affect the classification performance and therefore should not be used for training. Through experiments with 3 classifiers and 5 communities, we show that removing ambiguous users based on their tweets and profile can indeed result in a 10% increase in F1 performance.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"On Refining Twitter Lists as Ground Truth Data for Multi-community User Classification","journalPages":"765-772","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1261/5ddee29077c699d6b5d852bc79b87e99ba2c.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_74","https://anjiefang.github.io/papers/ting2018ecir.pdf"],"entities":["Display resolution","Experiment","Failure analysis","Ground truth","Statistical classification"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0148bbc80ea2f2526ab019a317639b4fb357f399","912c1b866c001d98f7091f8a28335f83d42e4856","05c5e1edd4153203548f895b4f007b2c78de9720","cdb328937e989ab62492e105512864d7cfff381e","b8f8980efb2684ba2a0b7ddf8ea88a9fe09f2ade","a66accffcd8b4c3ecdac3e1ffceaa46d33125921","11259931b73feac48633a4976825022e08dc4c15","9cc098409b7197748f65c9785d5978b5818211e1","0fe35d406842f054ce306ef67b20dc51a5a59dfd","6d43c41e19d994b802f5cff6fbe4e1feffd0d81f"],"id":"12615ddee29077c699d6b5d852bc79b87e99ba2c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/12615ddee29077c699d6b5d852bc79b87e99ba2c","authors":[{"name":"Ting Su","ids":["34750574"]},{"name":"Anjie Fang","ids":["31855550"]},{"name":"Richard McCreadie","ids":["1740893"]},{"name":"Craig MacDonald","ids":["2691614"]},{"name":"Iadh Ounis","ids":["1698205"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_74"}

An effective way to explore the information in text streams is topic modelling, which can further facilitate other applications such as search, information browsing, and pattern mining. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph based topic modelling approach for structuring asynchronous text streams. Our model integrates topic mining and time synchronization, two core modules for addressing the problem, into a unified model. Specifically, for handling the lexical gap issues, we use global semantic graphs of each timestamp for capturing the hidden interaction among entities from all the text streams. For dealing with the sources asynchronism problem, local semantic graphs are employed to discover similar topics of different entities that can be potentially separated by time gaps. Our experiment on two real-world datasets shows that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing ones.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Semantic Graph-Based Approach for Mining Common Topics from Multiple Asynchronous Text Streams","journalPages":"1201-1209","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/159b/0533d5cd584577f46fee35d58633a5d71dbf.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1201.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052630","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/133163/1/133163.pdf"],"entities":["Data mining","Entity","Topic model","Unified Model","Web 2.0"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["47ef445708f16763dc0432488b659bbf5f1be9a8","920871663e6016e59cac6396311355e723dd499f","28d7014a019a4a7dff37d93d3421c502c2423cdd","607b522c32d61474f2f05b2b23b7bc8e205cf821","1844cb8b89df24dd08b582b374355ccd43358220","21ef9c68739b0ddc7a9be31091c1882791e92780","c5ae092897581c41ed6b172841c4699f770db5f9","2c0dd733157e4a824dfe2ce2ce9bd7b29fc8a731","bab25739277ea852da199253f78d3aab8622bb97","dc8f89865ad9c9b6e643abc296ec5000ccdb16ee","e58c33a176ded8da01e1035125275ebbd5d03f84","340f80bc871e73cc6ce7b74385fa9a86b7eda837","078fdc9d7dd7105dcc5e65aa19edefe3e48e8bc7","95280ddaa4f4869718d341d1039ecbde1a009a52","4f94202c9300db57bae73af076f8711b286ec3b2","cdde854db72335113de22774e94ba03a2b3b5f5b","8e17ea56d8925bf997a6596a8e4f297826139ac6","0621213a012d169cb7c2930354c6489d6a89baf8","030f6132f6b6b3336ce9b0b29c5ac4c1e368b7dc","280c4cdea3356be5340ac0082a031137e88fd168","66a6dde6a6a20f77ce52cb2464a52777837bd81e","1486c598939edd974edd14fb5212c1368e580bb5","8ca3c8f845cfdf987a43b4bee753e3af2bff2d26","0b533ec5c5cd0dbe85e9f23c44ed3b3a9e87861f","0ef311acf523d4d0e2cc5f747a6508af2c89c5f7","6ff505e63ffebf419736d6c65741ee63b3ea720e","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","02485a373142312c354b79552b3d326913eaf86d","454b4ca144a218a9ce6e7d1e5110b3abaa3a409a","15ad630967c4cf7649ff86f7667a9f3e8d89bfc1"],"id":"159b0533d5cd584577f46fee35d58633a5d71dbf","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/159b0533d5cd584577f46fee35d58633a5d71dbf","authors":[{"name":"Long Chen","ids":["49330374"]},{"name":"Joemon M.

To efficiently learn node embeddings from a graph, graph embedding techniques usually preserve the proximity between node pairs sampled from the graph using random walks. In the context of a heterogeneous graph, which contains nodes from different domains, classical random walks are biased towards highly visible domains where nodes are associated with a dominant number of paths. To overcome this bias, existing heterogeneous graph embedding techniques typically rely on meta-paths (i.e., fixed sequences of node types) to guide random walks. However, using these meta-paths either requires prior knowledge from domain experts for optimal meta-path selection, or requires extended computations to combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution that does not involve any meta-path. Specifically, we propose JUST, a heterogeneous graph embedding technique using random walks with JUmp and STay strategies to overcome the aforementioned bias in an more efficient manner. JUST can not only gracefully balance between homogeneous and heterogeneous edges, it can also balance the node distribution over different domains (i.e., node types). By conducting a thorough empirical evaluation of our method on three heterogeneous graph datasets, we show the superiority of our proposed technique. In particular, compared to a state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph embedding technique Hin2vec, which tries to optimally combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length, our technique yields better results in most experiments, with a dramatically reduced embedding learning time (about 3x speedup).","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Are Meta-Paths Necessary?: Revisiting Heterogeneous Graph Embeddings","journalPages":"437-446","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://exascale.info/assets/pdf/CIKM2018_JUST.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271777"],"entities":["Cluster analysis","Computation","Downstream (software development)","Experiment","Flux balance analysis","Graph (discrete mathematics)","Graph embedding","Graph theory","Hoc (programming language)","Knowledge Graph","Programming paradigm","Resource Description Framework","Speedup","Subject-matter expert"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c18c30b9b1090e752031d23d219c1007b9954229","006906b6bbe5c1f378cde9fd86de1ce9e6b131da","a0775fab3b20f2dc0ac2f2626552d046b6afc225","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","33efd3ecffca21efaf9d1469b7dc3d2a72a0a05e","85b3193e329b7017cde6856b5cbbd3ff6e19f8f9","8117433f035c9254e37d316d7b57b1580cff8c5e","e1dd1bdea4748c1fb673c76c862d586242e0a193","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","20dc1890ca65e01856f31edf10126c2ad67e9d04","86aa6591b449f4a4caa0b41014a6f36f380398d5","af81c0d034373544b77619cc7b00c7388c908390","1c8c9a7713395e9a176c42e49bc80574a013f89f","28992e3ae9d81939125e87d7197f7d15abdae2ce","0710099aee18aabc0605c52628c29ac5ad94ec60","9d9d33843d018a77bad7f40da8f27671d29cd776","b7b9196227cdf2f55bd5b6fac373c9127ccb7b57","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","7c711f27f28ed0209e7df6e33bc84f340ae667d1","36f49b05d764bf5c10428b082c2d96c13c4203b9","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","13c40b32b9f35c8d24a5c00ec16a88382aaf07fe","22c361636877e5deee3c55192cc78fdcaba7907b","c2fd72cb2a77941e655b5d949d0d59b01e173c3b","52a150d6a098ef142bece099dadaa613fddbae50","13309bd4abd75d0bbacb7d4b80944c994958237f","556afe048b858463bfb25962321cd76581f47413"],"id":"8c5c7fe6d59c58e39692ab2bc9d1c95f3644be7a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8c5c7fe6d59c58e39692ab2bc9d1c95f3644be7a","authors":[{"name":"Rana Hussein","ids":["48180799"]},{"name":"Dingqi Yang","ids":["33829042"]},{"name":"Philippe Cudré-Mauroux","ids":["1680925"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271777"}

The rise of Web 2.0 technologies and the increased use of online social networks, promotes the study of trust among users. Drawing on social and psychological theory, we detect pairwise and global trust relations between users in the context of emergent real-world crisis scenarios. In such situations and scale, seeking explicit pairwise trust assessments between users is impractical. Instead, in an unsupervised manner we integrate the implicit factors of social influence exerted by each user over the network, the underlying network structural topology and the affective valence expressed by the users in the textual content they communicate. A key finding is the importance of modeling influence and affective valence in such exchanges and their role in detecting stable trust relationships. We extensively evaluate these ideas and demonstrate significant gains over competitive baselines across multiple datasets drawn from both crisis and non-crisis scenarios, including those with normative ground truth.","inCitations":["0a53c3b3da7ca5ca4529ecd0e80913ef8bc1b73d"],"pmid":"","title":"Predicting Trust Relations Within a Social Network: A Case Study on Emergency Response","journalPages":"53-62","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091494"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Emergence","Ground truth","Sensor","Social network","Unsupervised learning","Web 2.0"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5a2f063fe8401bbc8122b015c8a29f542520a2e6","00e85aa90893b7ec09d04eac72f9122620e82e8e","edf3551a64c16578f11fdfcd3bd7d6b111837de1","45d84d67870fc5de3b0747d05d9971d750604e7e","42f886ec78f257c872c279f239ece383b3e82627","fa4e93dbcdd1e4f20db9aeb34699a414420b7fd9","af6b154dc9b0a01d33b12256f7b2f5ad660e58e2","02bddd4c0adcd7d1401a07f95ebf5917b018351e","66ee511d8eadca0deb0fae3d3aba5e112b8338b8","27ae23bb8d284a1fa8c8ab24e23a72e1836ff5cc","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","51ddf8e1bb6cedcea7440419b591fa5f81aaee3d","a6b1acb6d0ff19d1f2f7787416693f79e3b147a7","4547356cc1e9315a66c7ddffa9362095c3727837","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","578c4bda0a3d0cfef2a87a22e2f65c4644a41cf1","570db03dfa324ef4c699d4264648d01e1519eebe","71e3e232ef6ef55dd9ab557ffe9f4811e856f42e","0706356c9ab6014d6b04577d38289ea8328291a5","d09311861276f8bae7cb15fa15e00931a35586c0","27e2d4a36ce20138cfb05c1ea60d7c6dceb20392","1da6557391992e286c036140826c5915e4f9b28f","3531e0eb9ec8a6ac786146c71ead7f8d624fd2ca","6561173e7be59063b069847f41c53a1657e04040","5ff35dcad5ba4297f29765acd5c28e085cf43344","bce3a871f856f815e8747254b8015190d171756b","9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d","04b3e9e7abe8b2d0be8ddfe080750bc4cb9473d9","04c93d7da5fd0a4aaaff819a7eb56235555bc7d2","c747dde903f507b38addce5448ae93e53f0896a8","1001b274f1d7ab16b26a871745b4918999d6d528","13f9d72c26c87bfaa6b6cf07c90be033a0c83608","1ad8410d0ded269af4a0116d8b38842a7549f0ae","1857a86f7aa0a527635a3144140f97518c60b871","452a1c3d098ee0141eb999939a5b4ccac9807ecf","a5a4e264913b9d5dff980cd6ff1d021851645af5","7314be5cd836c8f06bd1ecab565b00b65259eac6","b6f82f6f75fa494cba2d8764c789fdd70361094b","50ef0cbcc318ec98c7d6132b9c539e9cf41db010","05252b795f0f1238ac7e0d7af7fc2372c34a181d","8163dde29d6f55900b011a7cf5d40b04addd07ce","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","480b1e3419d38363604016a2746f3f9b3bdc7de6","139a195bfa51ee747f83d131182843438abcb02e","2e7335eea4bd102744b2d95d67a14d7143b01199","1f828ca13692cc66aec41b444edc67519d9f2470","dd43dc772b81f14e1c0acd2e734500940376d6c4","92ce82b6047040004a8484e20aab4fb88c9d50ab","46dcba93715fb8246c6d7aee96c9fba00fa902a8","7cf28b12cccf1d9c313fabb34e638fbee7874b02"],"id":"351ac4c4b3d586cae1378d4f9beb3346730beb02","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/351ac4c4b3d586cae1378d4f9beb3346730beb02","authors":[{"name":"Nikhita Vedula","ids":["19304470"]},{"name":"Srinivasan Parthasarathy","ids":["40042034"]},{"name":"Valerie L.

Our model, LRML (Latent Relational Metric Learning) is a novel metric learning approach for recommendation. More speci\u0080cally, instead of simple push-pull mechanisms between user and item pairs, we propose to learn latent relations that describe each user item interaction. \u008cis helps to alleviate the potential geometric in\u0083exibility of existing metric learing approaches. \u008cis enables not only be\u008aer performance but also a greater extent of modeling capability, allowing our model to scale to a larger number of interactions. In order to do so, we employ a augmented memory module and learn to a\u008aend over these memory blocks to construct latent relations. \u008ce memory-based a\u008aention module is controlled by the user-item interaction, making the learned relation vector speci\u0080c to each user-item pair. Hence, this can be interpreted as learning an exclusive and optimal relational translation for each user-item interaction. \u008ce proposed architecture demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance across multiple recommendation benchmarks. LRML outperforms other metric learning models by 6% − 7.5% in terms of Hits@10 and nDCG@10 on large datasets such as Net\u0083ix and MovieLens20M. Moreover, qualitative studies also demonstrate evidence that our proposed model is able to infer and encode explicit sentiment, temporal and a\u008aribute information despite being only trained on implicit feedback. As such, this ascertains the ability of LRML to uncover hidden relational structure within implicit datasets.","inCitations":["fb698241a9a6dec0ddd3e0bf85485ee0e31cbb6a","3e45ff12f098291d0fec1184eac4f24b32172126","6264736e6a92379a3aa4bca92c5bcf5dc1b5575e","7225b446d36c3d49f7be3cdcfc60537df1fb43e5","a01b81eb04b150f39ef102ac11ebdc2de1916946","b2016c936e83c8402f7ceec30e1b8a8a30e78e7d","164b4c02957540a5901d5e4a43473ee88c745973","b5c3c7893cf503bff7ef4f962056d7055f19c0f5","bf25fc54f9c1f02384840eb763ab8e34620a1731","1942250b72d2a195db11fbadd9ab7ee6a12027a3","0cfac458b176a1e81879aff4344c5278114cc171"],"pmid":"","title":"Latent Relational Metric Learning via Memory-based Attention for Collaborative Ranking","journalPages":"729-739","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe0c/3094d81d40374d6e6e1107a4724ec36cd311.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186154","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05176v3.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Benchmark (computing)","ENCODE","Interaction","Logical equality","Memory module"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1b29786b7e43dda1a4d6ee93f520a2960b1e3126","d5a823053663a77869d4b38a8026c51ebc2e975e","261b447f58db876247bcdd5343a5c79fbcf01268","087cb6fa2dffd6a38f3f9baeccff79c3d84c1e1f","081ad92ce0e71541646218f11061c86414a960c2","5324ba064dc1656dd51c04122c2c802ef9ec28ce","9e63233e36f70361c3fb00b2a2894951e7606852","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","24e2ac56c810f773bd4b2d03e7e9bc1a4519ed7a","24be66032aa1957e6f2ca714b76689093725dafe","10ebd5c40277ecba4ed45d3dc12f9f1226720523","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","6b8b2075319accc23fef43e4cf76bc3682189d82","29d591806cdc6ef0d580e4a21f32e5ad9d09d148","087ab67119b7caf129e93d8daa170a7c12a2a8f6","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","276ebc620a8976026bd2d03582b9ecfa3738d43c","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","fb641dbada6a27b009cb28a629e7f02fbeec6e10","2ef7d506b25731d0f3ec0c8f90b718b6e5bbd069","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726","1b1df9f75ee6f27433687dad302387f811dab64d","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","0842636e2efd5a0c0f34ae88785af29612814e17","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","64edd2c5c41e856695e1dcb950c0512c3a87edec","bf9ca74b5b82e9679383e0d1e9e4ae9b14b68b99","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","09a503095db2d68b439e48d67481399198ed0e5b","fab77f4f239e73469af62102d91e4d5404b5d7b3","12db83e66e50152e170d5009c425c925ad2e2c2a","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","5720a5015ca67400fadd0ff6863519f4b030e731"],"id":"23b0a959d07a744a80734119e94262f14f2d83e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/23b0a959d07a744a80734119e94262f14f2d83e1","authors":[{"name":"Yi Tay","ids":["3665875"]},{"name":"Luu Anh Tuan","ids":["26336902"]},{"name":"Siu Cheung Hui","ids":["1716044"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186154"}

The reason is that at each iteration, the number of operations may be too small. We point out that this common understanding may not be true if the algorithm sequentially accesses the data in a feature-wise manner. For almost all real-world sparse sets we have examined, some features are much denser than others. Thus a direct parallelization of loops in a sequential method may result in excellent speedup. This approach possesses an advantage of retaining all convergence results because the algorithm is not changed at all. We apply this idea on coordinate descent (CD) methods, which are effective single-thread technique for L1-regularized classification. Further, an investigation on the shrinking technique commonly used to remove some features in the training process shows that this technique helps the parallelization of CD methods. Experiments indicate that a naive parallelization achieves better speedup than existing methods that laboriously modify the algorithm to achieve parallelism. Though a bit ironic, we conclude that the naive parallelization of the CD method is a highly competitive and robust multi-core implementation for L1-regularized classification.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Naive Parallelization of Coordinate Descent Methods and an Application on Multi-core L1-regularized Classification","journalPages":"1103-1112","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/l1_parallel.pdf","https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/l1_parallel_cikm.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271687","https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/multicore-liblinear/l1_parallel_supp.pdf","https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/multicore-liblinear/l1_parallel_supp_cikm.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Automatic parallelization","Coordinate descent","Iteration","Linear classifier","Mathematical optimization","Multi-core processor","Parallel computing","Sparse matrix","Speedup","Stochastic gradient descent","Thread (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7007a8c976ce74ee7a7832c30eab0c5a9e8effbe","05bc490f266b86c2932f6a731615edd221fe27d8","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","065106eb8e909dee92b328ea986c26e852206b0a","1267fe36b5ece49a9d8f913eb67716a040bbcced","32ef8d891edde06cc01357fa5c4d1ab7fe631720","1b4e9910dd53c65b17a45662a733fe5af6adc07a","73eeeb984a15bb83fac23d276c973312b4bf6dd1","7e688b260483badfed211273b7da2a4bfea290cd","348a5ce76222582849fa67fdad196bcc8ea96a62","c66b6aa41812e00facea7b5de249b9670c602fd3","3557a5708b85a99be717307a4946454b0c402a94","27fe7beadff4d9c692a084e5fde3d8fb33f5f77a","3b938f66d03559e1144fa2ab63a3a9a076a6b48b","ca6d801bd3508049c694a48e1527ab793051881e","065e808aa05fe23de00ab4510d1607ddff04c232","0c157fa7fec2ad6318f0008b733ce2806f847a1a","f689e5fb80a09e8175dcaa8b47ddf9725a1ef9d3","73b37d2c110526f361bd676401d2564b322d889c","0788cda105da9853627d3e1ec8d01e01f7239c30"],"id":"084ca39d34f31c77fbc595ffa64b6f4f2c9dedbc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/084ca39d34f31c77fbc595ffa64b6f4f2c9dedbc","authors":[{"name":"Yong Zhuang","ids":["15586521"]},{"name":"Yu-Chin Juan","ids":["2797198"]},{"name":"Guo-Xun Yuan","ids":["3181335"]},{"name":"Chih-Jen Lin","ids":["1711460"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271687"}

These models often represent a question by a single vector and find its corresponding matches by attending to candidate answers. However, questions and answers might be related to each other in complicated ways which cannot be captured by single-vector representations. In this paper, we propose Multihop Attention Networks (MAN) which aim to uncover these complex relations for ranking question and answer pairs. Unlike previous models, we do not collapse the question into a single vector, instead we use multiple vectors which focus on different parts of the question for its overall semantic representation and apply multiple steps of attention to learn representations for the candidate answers. For each attention step, in addition to common attention mechanisms, we adopt sequential attention which utilizes context information for computing context-aware attention weights. Via extensive experiments, we show that MAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmark QA datasets. Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of sequential attention over other attention mechanisms.","inCitations":["e235387131b35a2b507afadfcbe0c831b5faa15c"],"pmid":"","title":"Multihop Attention Networks for Question Answer Matching","journalPages":"325-334","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210009"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Benchmark (computing)","Convolutional neural network","Experiment","Google Questions and Answers","Natural language","Question answering","Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm","Software quality assurance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","03feca688989940fd4a5a13ac8837403b1af5e25","204a4a70428f3938d2c538a4d74c7ae0416306d8","18cd08248be658abcfb6f72a3033b911474541e9","4e8e560328f8d7358535913d56b35f0ac89606be","7aa63f414a4d7c6e4369a15a04dc5d3eb5da2b0e","525f65936c331b0b766c7aea0eae64c595704c50","2cb8497f9214735ffd1bd57db645794459b8ff41","a62b58c267fddfa06545a7fc63a3c62ef7dc9e15","118be9cf31ecf5cbdd49a19da8615b593ec61a4c","afa692db6844852d2566cfa65f24428745248a65","68e4aedc69518d8db2f143bd3952668aa41c762c","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1261fe9bfde319abcc5d011bc70f7e7547b5258f","0b0cf7e00e7532e38238a9164f0a8db2574be2ea","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","24b4746688c15c8580d1000d4f4ac63f5eb79561","bc34eee11d8ddba18a262a637ea336322c93ba6c","468b9055950c428b17f0bf2ff63fe48a6cb6c998","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","03fe39386ce90e10ec87f10e00532c5cf30b244f","12db83e66e50152e170d5009c425c925ad2e2c2a","e5d9bd94a65f3ed497a4d36e089b1393b0e5520d","04ee77ef1143af8b19f71c63b8c5b077c5387855","73d826d4c2363701b88e3e234fe3b8756c0f9671","3e393df4a5731fb7b49cf2f527fed1ee4e6e6942","6d5e12ee5d75d5f8c04a196dd94173f96dc8603f","1bea6bbdb4aed87fff5390d42934a1d9b0a7bec4","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","0af737eae02032e66e035dfed7f853ccb095d6f5","52956422f86722aca6becb67ea4c3ad61f0c1aea","828dbeb7cf922dc9b6657dd169b8d26d2b58eedb","0fd0e3854ee696148e978ec33d5c042554cd4d23","f93a0a3e8a3e6001b4482430254595cf737697fa"],"id":"45d4338309f9aa2e18fefcb686fb313067139729","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/45d4338309f9aa2e18fefcb686fb313067139729","authors":[{"name":"Nam Khanh Tran","ids":["39903329"]},{"name":"Claudia Niederée","ids":["1718268"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210009"}

Users, when assessing the usefulness of an unfamiliar dataset, need means to quickly inspect its contents. To satisfy the needs, we propose to automatically extract an optimal small portion from a dataset, called a snippet, to concisely illustrate the contents of the dataset. We consider the quality of a snippet from three aspects: coverage, familiarity, and cohesion, which are jointly formulated in a new combinatorial optimization problem called the maximum-weight-and-coverage connected graph problem (MwcCG). We give a constant-factor approximation algorithm for this NP-hard problem, and experiment with our solution on real-world datasets.

However, understanding the prevalence and impact of personal attacks in online platforms at scale remains surprisingly difficult. The contribution of this paper is to develop and illustrate a method that combines crowdsourcing and machine learning to analyze personal attacks at scale. We show an evaluation method for a classifier in terms of the aggregated number of crowd-workers it can approximate. We apply our methodology to English Wikipedia, generating a corpus of over 100k high quality human-labeled comments and 63M machine-labeled ones from a classifier that is as good as the aggregate of 3 crowd-workers. Using the corpus of machine-labeled scores, our methodology allows us to explore some of the open questions about the nature of online personal attacks. This reveals that the majority of personal attacks on Wikipedia are not the result of a few malicious users, nor primarily the consequence of allowing anonymous contributions.","inCitations":["9d3b2f5a737d1c7192fa015ff86ef810e6ae4237","608aa69f210b4d91baf16080272ea411d6b9fb76","192a943ad1895f0d77af7931135e5292f18a6649","27c86097ad1e03a821c7764fef05335be86855b6","2f659dd2509b2f05b0fdf2961eb02831411b9919","421e454bfbd306ede09decf2096a7c8f680e75ac","ff737e1d2885e5a3e5d8d8da24aa0461da128666","f3aadc407febb2b5c0d332c4e800c8c86963f794","cf398ecfc6aa381d30044af96b0c3a1723e03225","3b6a48fb7111412e1e8c406072194416a6df3a6e","c6bda0740a69d98dc8caacea693ba4ebc7bfcfcb","8b4dcb69e5279f9f9472777e9c1e8d824a7de7c4","67dfb4311fc598e5e51910dc6eb091d7042cf9cb","42790bd4a9fc58bc129053841bad0ab2eaf0e0bc","7554e7c56813731acfefdaf898ccb03e0d667007","f3d78ad41ae5cad0a9676869eafef8e41b214edb","44fc8d79fb8e0f8c6c6f680179b5803a789c6227","866a7a52e09abc651a96bffc2b07879b8e6789fc","71483aea0f43d154e2c193808dc5a98befcdb73b","b9f4cb8e84ea0a44d09f38cd777a986d21d3d219","bc3b51cc123a58c92afa46127d4aba5345353e79","a042046f76ea2e124d7407ce5d87da8a84bd13ca","30b82ff201bcacc8b3e1dbecfd79308f3137706f","a6456c1c9c4b2ce23332aae91137bd565efc56d5","0dca29b6a5ea2fe2b6373aba9fe0ab829c06fd78","0cd9cd00551121908e2334547f21b5ffcfb90cc0","083b95dd57e52e832b402df66ae09bc1b2b0d518","0c0e91c76909e24f1101bef21073afb04ba1ee60","d8a1d44d93da18a57f4582dcc2f388777d76b2fb","99a35a6991f7cf9719fdf708afb8b2c86740971f","14bc937fe2e2907d35a7afa012ef5c9484da1644","e1fbcd67d3479124222b553eb5cf9a588737f440","dbced044a819d55cf171aec1c447494bddc23560","1b5abf6e904a8a119be38b1ddbaa3341cdaa40d7","9878a6142e44753d94ead25c9d3f77284b365ba5","724e7fc0016b6aca020680ae14cc8eb9e399f482","07f7cd76a9631ccd4a084dbc4dd7a98c380a14c5","e1aed598882f94c4b01b4e63fbd6294bc92549ec","624ffc3675964e156e21e79e6b223b808cf3752f","a46be92b6d2e0d18fbdc7a5e9fa6c92591afcbe5","e502a6795dc272a035144af7acd9631809f87ad1","3b434777dd98d03427a7e25cc9f9ad6b461ad318","7e4676c4f2d3643c74ca642651f783917a543e06","0f499a7510c65c24c1c8e4a3a266c4264345b4a1","74c3a14d40d5cdd332c32a57a0d116f965eb333b","1bd7f7e5350c25d40534d93b1923e4278a057458","2f8c9de0985b1d93e4634a08153044013775baf3","b3b097bda9834de2a7b5754ad49044dfee95ef95","0ba7de992d997997e1333d767317381339495d18","bfad7ef60f5a4e1fd24edc7856c08382b708052a","127bfde40fb4a550b0b3cb993ffcaa973172ebe5","74a495d16203dcc880864a4b2e2368cbf7ae0f8c","747073e183d017dc2953d9b397316de2f9f04d23","20f69cc41c87b8abdf36761c623d65713daeab3b","65b38dd0e80cfb30634017ed59607de5cfa77f12","f7075a3e6fb681b46aa5b483e17f8986c331aaf2","7c9d35a732644e9bfbc8c1e2a9224eeea371042c","4b88e934ee9a222f014ca10ab5bdeebdc0942599","32b35252693f859e55a8a7945cf8947bfca7c867","c7eba4ee84ce9d8db071e5d7922060ec3d8398c5","aa032c689b52538264c5d5ec561cb2af626cd5fd","2dc3f7bc70e432a9df8aa5eceb15804eaf6c44c6","b663e16f3b466278c0ee24f1780935755c6dd436","b4c4ff7cbb7ef2e9407d2819adc8f3b60265d296","7404d9020500f5d39206f7f59448a8dc2cb521f5"],"pmid":"","title":"Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale","journalPages":"1391-1399","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6f35/b070c250507dbec8a7365cf01b25eb66d792.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1391.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08914v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052591","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08914v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08914"],"entities":["Aggregate data","Approximation algorithm","Computer-mediated communication","Crowdsourcing","Display resolution","Ex Machina","Machina (company)","Machine learning","Text corpus","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["db5511e90b2f4d650067ebf934294617eff81eca","50b06fbedf13a36003be94ef9dcb5236ed07cf51","1c63272c69fae926c1a5ffdc57ad008b30083b5b","1a3591b22a35b635e54ee74d6c54673df47f78c2","87fe8163dcaff9b5cb759439c47c2c4661c78829","9ae976f82e11f7ecc3fd9f8d17a2744582cb22e8","6be3134d654d494cb781da09400d9da26793255b","9bae51fce09dd0ce3d5202e340002b79871c78e8","19e89e748b7cf86ba1b35fdc21acf232c2b22e63","30724dcd69e05b601fa4c95623068104971a4a27","812183caa91bab9c2729de916ee3789b68023f39","ad1b63587737cb0716b14f45668869bbb6bf82d2","6d4b244deee49cd1bf8d28e2df9a08afb8828fb2","0e67bac2937f5f53f310564efa547efd82c0371d","e39b586e561b36a3b71fa3d9ee7cb15c35d84203","c07d6b1e5d069ce2395f3892ab432d294f23709a","07c5e7e735992a1902db557928782f374d6fdf7e","2aab45ffcd28f3945f2b3bda34887ccdd14adfc3","3fa4d63e0194cdbd909c579456830e0a7c909242","b9895c47cc273d2cd78c9f6320da937497ad0351"],"id":"4a7204431900338877c738c8f56b10a71a52e064","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4a7204431900338877c738c8f56b10a71a52e064","authors":[{"name":"Ellery Wulczyn","ids":["2618745"]},{"name":"Nithum Thain","ids":["2665391"]},{"name":"Lucas Dixon","ids":["39996661"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052591"}

Two key challenges are making use of mention's context to disambiguate (i.e. local objective), and promoting coherence of all the linked entities (i.e. global objective). In this paper, we propose a deep neural network model to effectively measure the semantic matching between mention's context and target entity. We are the first to employ the long short-term memory (LSTM) and attention mechanism for entity disambiguation. We also propose Pair-Linking, a simple but effective and significantly fast linking algorithm. Pair-Linking iteratively identifies and resolves pairs of mentions, starting from the most confident pair. It finishes linking all mentions in a document by scanning the pairs of mentions at most once. Our neural network model combined with Pair-Linking, named NeuPL, outperforms state-of-the-art systems over different types of documents including news, RSS, and tweets.","inCitations":["23b0a959d07a744a80734119e94262f14f2d83e1","5605199ff169628f4cc4897db758466378d7ce75","9e63233e36f70361c3fb00b2a2894951e7606852","bbcd2b832df4b41ee54b6e584b95726346964cfc","3d050e1f70fbe67ccb7a34146200e85d9a456387","0cfac458b176a1e81879aff4344c5278114cc171","474aaeebd453a18cdc32776ba19a222713f5ef96","629feacc0f099f72618e7df7f48ee44f99c46f38","723bcd04f88d72338ee0ed5efd0294e799aa1c6d","b9015d4f1e591eba7ea21c3566c919f80f7c2afe","464225c2c57d40f311a1f2ea534046f11d8a568d","fb5ba26e4b7e2c4705fb2aa9975f85e9c19e9437"],"pmid":"","title":"NeuPL: Attention-based Semantic Matching and Pair-Linking for Entity Disambiguation","journalPages":"1667-1676","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132963"],"entities":["Algorithm","Artificial neural network","Deep learning","Entity linking","Experiment","Fastest","Knowledge base","Long short-term memory","Network model","RSS","Semantic matching","Wikipedia","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["128d2482c0968cbd7639ecbe7dca97c11cf51570","3cdc6d108e48140c017efe1f6f05c6adffcc3980","0b0dc14b8a8dcccbfc62a38355fff2f6a361e9d2","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","c279c21fe34e259763998969d76035ae7535990d","30a5a31ef4c213e22850afe6ab0069d0428972d6","77d2698e8efadda698b0edb457cd8de75224bfa0","1ccf386465081b6f8cad5a753827de7576dfe436","6beb7a83c762f1f6796e602f71191ceef95027ff","1896b3f4a6aeb327ca2dc9fbea53f0a1b130cbe9","4824837f551235398dd8300984cb29629aaa3c90","57166612b98f291b85bbcaaef0c1bdfa234935fc","1d2a4018b4fc6a5f498e65d68260615dbc9e7ec6","08b4efb97d98f4e66d8872899661f31ea58664da","0b9dea9414a3acbd5d00e00541f917f96be68e19","10ce58375314f90f83ca3bb88840cbc67bf8050f","bcae9da4151d4accf3d90ef8bab883fbec35cb85","51b5cecc3881f1608ce53c4229682f55e1787fa6","01fcc1df1c1b90745f5721125931ba4ed052fe3b","9b36aacc8434fcf82c998d83e050e253407ca4b2","2d643f2e3efd2d2543cd6824bec0cd5e9da85437","2cb8497f9214735ffd1bd57db645794459b8ff41","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","81f8706abcecfc748f2e27d6f7a92628036d6846","12f7b71324ee8e1796a9ef07af05b66674fe6af0","324fc9c732116fa81624faad07524039f193cede","c99165b6cfb6dcff8db0ef912fc417e6e79a5e36","1c9aca60f7ac5edcceb73d612806704a7d662643","166fee9452934aa612c56d6162e5e2ba427bdfb3","07abd02f02774d178f26ca99937e5f94001a9ec9","5849552213363da6c309999f937710778fb749f6","582ea307db25c5764e7d2ed82c4846757f4e95d7","93cbd1f313dad71b355a9743fba64182e63c3b81","468b9055950c428b17f0bf2ff63fe48a6cb6c998","5433d3cd12a6edbe3ec14f8895c7d6f4e4448565","1c909ac1c331c0c246a88da047cbdcca9ec9b7e7","306fad753dc178a9d8168bec3500d89d80320317","dc463b4950cb00e5fba3822924edda1d0b6d07ec","4015bce2713d4e5a6d78b05989d28763e763547d","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","aa2a7ac7bfa9a0201d4faddd4e7bb26299a5e0be","209da37048fd9d549df583490929adbe089d0805","95797bc972450f92619fbda7bfb0398662f9973f","24b4746688c15c8580d1000d4f4ac63f5eb79561","92f0af4fe05bf61ecd10ba9ab3d06030c784a09d"],"id":"261b447f58db876247bcdd5343a5c79fbcf01268","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/261b447f58db876247bcdd5343a5c79fbcf01268","authors":[{"name":"Minh C.

Such data is often informally referred to as \u2019dark\u2019 due to the difficulties of understanding its contents. For example, there are millions of structured tables available on the Web, but finding a specific table or summarizing all Web tables to understand what information is available is infeasible or very difficult because of the scale involved. Here we present and demonstrate CognitiveDB, an intelligent cognitive data management system that can quickly summarize the contents of an unexplored large-scale structured dataset, visualize it for interactive navigation, understanding, and support intelligent query processing.","inCitations":["343d9c74d1465f884039b2145ed2fcc6bfcc26ca","db3f6e3d916b94449d2871e44031337bc36735c7"],"pmid":"","title":"CognitiveDB: An Intelligent Navigator for Large-scale Dark Structured Data","journalPages":"207-211","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2c78/b4daa1342010858ceaa5b86cdf3e82522698.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p207.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054735"],"entities":["Big data","Database","Table (database)","Web application","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1f0eda1db97ca68c78e7864fcda77e4a3b7c2437","96531057874ad205c2ca3fc097082325c88d2599","ca044fd0d3360d24c65a9c4bbafc72c80147a1ec","1e3d64487f791c8584c6070a3e6201a419e8cae0","515b9903cb55e548b6732e953a1bd51f457c6353","99df46571fd8dbac559879c924a7809e3b10d2c6","ee2aae30153b6ce8b5d38e1686adc294c129602e","3b3367f8f0d4692abe6c111a14bb702f30ab20a3","81693700bc61370af27da4676c2eba957d615e28","eee42f1b15f90578379e91286faf7457a4d8987a","cbf752d3fe7e3a1cac5c9f62b88ba9a6aa07ba54","2a8197b7a8d5329e11e14f4ffb9e209ba977dbc3","dbc81e944ded4cf4f06c08bc2fc3a40b69e57d42","beab54b0444a7bbb9b3dbe2f061b4f3767e2ec82","5c1dcb65595b35e71a871f7c78ef7e98b91e7b51","7a75c886b043e7c3f77829412774de27648f384a","6dc34bae7fb2e12499ebdff2902ccde612dbb0f1","0d756460546595eb7097b3f9c5d27179c1f002fd","db291a559c385ecccfce742424f07c15219aae37","bbf9946752cc6456a333e16413583e2e98ef8554","e0b371fbc501072b960ac50b7b9aac6f14dc0857","c5e80fec72f7458b52aee6dec60ff93d7b8cd8dc","04b55cb152457e741aeffcc06108963a019c8cc6","77ef53389bf33bba0d5369e63da779d6b909187d"],"id":"2c78b4daa1342010858ceaa5b86cdf3e82522698","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2c78b4daa1342010858ceaa5b86cdf3e82522698","authors":[{"name":"Michael N.

We propose a simple and practical interactive relevance feedback mechanism where the user is asked to annotate relevant/irrelevant results from the top n hits. We then utilize this feedback for query reformulation and term weighting where weights are assigned based on how good each term is at discriminating the relevant vs. irrelevant candidates. First, we demonstrate the efficacy of the distributed representations on the CLEF-IP 2010 dataset where we achieve significant improvement of 4.6% in recall over the keyword search baseline. Second, we simulate interactivity to demonstrate the efficacy of our interactive term weighting mechanism. Simulation results show that we can achieve significant improvement in recall from one interaction iteration outperforming previous semantic and interactive patent retrieval methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Toward an Interactive Patent Retrieval Framework based on Distributed Representations","journalPages":"957-960","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210106"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Entity","HOOD method","Interactivity","Iteration","Peer-to-Patent","Quick Response Engine","Relevance feedback","Search algorithm","Simulation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["00c656e914eb0236bdb10294fd856d1c537dd1f2","4685f6b848ca33135f61dbd5ada8ad6ef5a35ef9","3d6e764f6890f647d345c21fd8d293ef510d6197","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","2070380fc7fba423cc4233329e3fa46859cb0dc3","f848e6fb792d53ec055facb64eac9e6fb79cd809","cd46dade1ab041af60a7eb1af330c1b8553ef3b7","a2405c6e2a90378e9af4dd8739d5fba216a90a38","2477164862ddb750593ffb96b6fb1686803aefd7","59c9da928fbf10da0c46eef255f14aba2a8ed9a9","06d6725dfd456902a32c61d955dcbc0fdff4a15a","f609ebb9b9e04d386dd8c0d844558d7f36530322","b0c62db51f8b0d2a45cd8fdc2d888a3d18bce79a"],"id":"62300855c24fcd001c1c0a3ce979a441bfeff7cd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/62300855c24fcd001c1c0a3ce979a441bfeff7cd","authors":[{"name":"Walid Shalaby","ids":["2719971"]},{"name":"Wlodek Zadrozny","ids":["2606846"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210106"}

These metrics are predictive of companies\u2019 long-term goals, but suffer from this property due to slow user learning of an evaluated treatment, which causes a delay in the treatment effect. That, in turn, causes low sensitivity of the metrics and requires to conduct A/B experiments with longer duration or larger set of users from a limited traffic. In this paper, we study how the delay property of user learning can be used to improve sensitivity of several popular metrics of user loyalty and activity. We consider both novel and previously known modifications of these metrics, including different methods of quantifying a trend in a metric\u2019s time series and delaying its calculation. These modifications are analyzed with respect to their sensitivity and directionality on a large set of A/B tests run on real users of Yandex. We discover that mostly loyalty metrics gain profit from the considered modifications.

Yet all of them assume that a single matching function should be used for all queries. In practice, user's queries may be of various nature which might require different levels of matching, from low level word matching to high level conceptual matching. To cope with this problem, we propose a multi-level abstraction convolutional model (MACM) that generates and aggregates several levels of matching scores. Weak supervision is used to address the problem of large training data. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed MACM model.","inCitations":["b6ef3817f795d4f5eb45255a2e0f77e164bf6701","f4b96cbeff598f6655ec16bfc754b92fa416df21","d9a633d57312f59393fcf98e1f5f25b3b5cbf904"],"pmid":"","title":"Multi-level Abstraction Convolutional Model with Weak Supervision for Information Retrieval","journalPages":"985-988","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/sites/default/files/publis/p985-nie.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210123"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Convolution","High- and low-level","High-level programming language","Information retrieval","Random neural network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8478c0f46dd30ef7f4052145983d6d315c2e1f17","fc981c140ae0331b5ea20f48cb92762d8e8316b9","4736c3d6f33569e2a3fef2b6617d4b7ae782ce94","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","56d03ab8afe62e40c34cfb79607efa1ffac1988c"],"id":"da036a105189563b2f6e8f559a774e301d4dc2c5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/da036a105189563b2f6e8f559a774e301d4dc2c5","authors":[{"name":"Yifan Nie","ids":["32631211"]},{"name":"Alessandro Sordoni","ids":["2041695"]},{"name":"Jian-Yun Nie","ids":["1807485"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210123"}

We show that by training a click model with pairwise loss, as is done in ranking problems, our approach achieves personalized reranking performance comparable to the stateof-the-art while eliminating much of the complexity required by previous models. This contrasts with other approaches that rely on complex feature engineering.","inCitations":["775513066557e20dc3117fbaaea17891e88d6795","fd027a42f2a40e644dbf7e15aa451de132ec6618","1bf553817c214503d29e1dc41c021b0241ed45c6"],"pmid":"","title":"Simple Personalized Search Based on Long-Term Behavioral Signals","journalPages":"95-107","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/813d/f20116a4a09b7d82783cb2480594840a4ffa.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/sepliarskaia-simple-2017.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_8"],"entities":["Algorithm","Consistency model","Feature engineering","Learning to rank","Microsoft Research","Personalization","Personalized search","Ranking (information retrieval)","Relevance","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c094f037905d0b690e393984859f3f5a2cbaadee","31821f81c091d2deceed17206528223a8a5b8822","b838268a512bfcfa55f46d861f1257543ceb1ce5","2d60e105525d3d1d11fe14e80e30fec9327914cc","ba1ea662bce87e8a44d85932354b8bcdba1ecc2f","2dc2b616769483f1ff380a2d70a9ea6744e23d65","52aa034a1c1413e03e7895dab0a0b67549cf92e1","4752e8858dd67002b16b281e115655307ec3c974","a4177d95e4553202fbb07917e63abdeb16af1b41","10ceb668f84860bb09fca364125cae4b1ee2e760","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7","012927ab94f0e542ce137e032b0288bbfbc2f9ca","44c6c5928520d19744e00c805552b5e85fe0a9db","ace1706d5a9ed941a8ba7fb8cd44b79fb541cb95","48886ea4ee14f0151f186207e1b9ad1d947e83ef","0eb4f4b40636620e7bc43ee6875feb5532ed308a","055370f1e989a8a726058073dad8dd64866b8882","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","2d7f7c9dd68e86ef977a0294a35abb63d9c7bceb","463d800cddb82480c682c12c9e693a3f1a1a78cb","9286893dff1250a6b7956536a10200adbd1c6541"],"id":"813df20116a4a09b7d82783cb2480594840a4ffa","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/813df20116a4a09b7d82783cb2480594840a4ffa","authors":[{"name":"Anna Sepliarskaia","ids":["10175775"]},{"name":"Filip Radlinski","ids":["1803571"]},{"name":"Maarten de Rijke","ids":["1696030"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_8"}

Since data points within the same cluster may be distributed over different workers which result in several disjoint-sets, merging them incurs large communication costs. In our algorithm, we employ a fast global union approach to union the disjoint-sets to alleviate the communication burden. Experiments over the datasets of different scales demonstrate that PS-DBSCAN outperforms the PDSDBSCAN with 2-10 times speedup on communication efficiency. We have released our PS-DBSCAN in an algorithm platform called Platform of AI (PAI) in Alibaba Cloud.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Communication Efficient Parallel DBSCAN Algorithm based on Parameter Server","journalPages":"2107-2110","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133112"],"entities":["Algorithm","Apache Spark","Benchmark (computing)","Central processing unit","DBSCAN","Data point","Dhrystone","Disjoint-set data structure","Message Passing Interface","Multithreading (computer architecture)","Speedup","Thread (computing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["05da432072f095deb74cbcee9c6005df9437f9e2","79716c4dd0a5921664baae716a168165eaf28899","4244628f1005785a21a6fdb3f4b26d1f06cf1871","0de0c3240bda7972bd0a3c8369ebc4b4f2e4f9c2","82fafb4c5dfb61901751f47b049d0c67ce64f803","00e19d486a4339abfb5af2a791f5efb37d7ee890","a3f8a3948e5999def4a0819d0dbaef2ae05e1599","13a375a84a6c414b85477a401541d3e28db1e11a","12d49ecc6aa2bf20a850100cafe061a237a4874e","09e58fa112d943a514eac067f37e8c6d9c2cfaef","9ab813f45a15ec8b85c3b4de039521a18ec66f8b","adde56ae2edaf73fbfb31ed82ce7f044b6a45019","c88eeba6443487523ac06938e032c852e33b4960","5869b3d5607bff1a079aa24c8a241d656fe683b7"],"id":"c779c5079af6fc8cb5bd7005823249e74867bdaa","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c779c5079af6fc8cb5bd7005823249e74867bdaa","authors":[{"name":"Xu Hu","ids":["50049968"]},{"name":"Jun Huang","ids":["1691901"]},{"name":"Minghui Qiu","ids":["2642333"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133112"}

Due to its benefit, it is very urgent to understand web tables. An important task in web table understanding is the column-type detection, which detects the most likely types (categories) to describe the columns in the web table. Some existing studies use knowledge bases to determine the column types. However, this problem has three challenges. (i) Web tables are too dirty to be understood. (ii) Knowledge bases are not comprehensive enough to cover all the columns. (iii) The size of both knowledge bases and web tables are extremely huge. Thus, traditional approaches encounter the limitations with low quality and poor scalability. Also, they cannot extract the best type from top-k types automatically. To address these limitations, we propose a collective inference approach (CIA) based on Topic Sensitive PageRank, which considers not only the types of detected columns, but also the collective information of web tables to automatically produce more accurate top-k types, especially the top-1 type, for both incorrectly detected columns and undetectable columns whose cells do not exist in the knowledge base. We also propose three methods to improve the inference performance and implemented techniques of CIA in MapReduce. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our CIA achieves much higher quality in top-1 type detection as well as the entity enrichment, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Web Table Understanding by Collective Inference","journalPages":"217-226","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271729"],"entities":["Column (database)","Display resolution","Entity","Gene Ontology Term Enrichment","IBM Notes","Knowledge base","MapReduce","PageRank","Scalability","Semantic matching","Web application","Web search engine","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002","2b9cd09b949b7e69933d18ae408397e803987151","00a3f6924f90fcd77e6e7e6534b957a75d0ced07","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","fc2f98cb904e1f939cbf9212b4053e0ac3c66dc6","07506336397160283caeef4a0173cfeb4ef4e45a","ca044fd0d3360d24c65a9c4bbafc72c80147a1ec","8584bc6fb5fe616d338d5ae3d20d4848572b5578","515b9903cb55e548b6732e953a1bd51f457c6353","60cb5302d8c2944e28523ef921b54eeaf1822382","45048079b07e51f004115467bbbf9232fc0eff4a","3baecc04e1341cbae7999e8f61a3946c76504828","2378e4de465227e44978f6259ac97f763448ea82","b75428bc47306492df2eeb61bb72a43d736d7e0e","5a8ffffa7a9b9e23a06f8e5bbb9fc3f912a73906","4043995d64efeebe1d80ebbe903d032171043fa8","0d756460546595eb7097b3f9c5d27179c1f002fd","8ee38ec2d2da62ad96e36c7804b3bbf3a5153ab7","4fa0d9c4c3d17458085ee255b7a4b7c325d59e32","1d554970b7094288cd43ee6eb43755b299a3b9f8","385ff79dc6182c49010f75e92760d8c5e9d9abd7","4008d78a584102086f2641bcb0dab51aff0d353b","1f990d98dcc3941f01bd6bb5405fbda37e00dd6a","0ecdf0d9e33ae993d5f789c6e1bb410ba2fca0b8","f8f30e910e47b0c3efdebe33fc05c8cfa4f2d0b2","45b830bac3764a3c941f7b2bec905663ac9f24f0"],"id":"cfeed4157864c2cabefd4cde0b790121b0ccad9a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cfeed4157864c2cabefd4cde0b790121b0ccad9a","authors":[{"name":"San Kim","ids":["4411705"]},{"name":"Guoliang Li","ids":["23492509"]},{"name":"Jianhua Feng","ids":["33091680"]},{"name":"Kaiyu Li","ids":["2087802"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271729"}

We present a widely-used statistical tool, \\em meta-analysis, as a framework for reporting results from IR experiments using multiple test collections. We demonstrate the meta-analytical approach through two standard experiments on stemming and pseudo-relevance feedback, and compare the results to those obtained from score standardization. Meta-analysis incorporates several recent recommendations in the literature, including score standardization, reporting effect sizes rather than score differences, and avoiding a reliance on null-hypothesis statistical testing, in a unified approach.

Intelligence estimation from images is a difficult task even for humans, but experimental results show that human accuracy can be equalled using computing methods. We report the image features that predict both measured and perceived intelligence, and highlight misleading features such as \"smiling'' and \"wearing glasses'' that are correlated with perceived but not measured intelligence. Our results give insights into inaccurate stereotyping from profile images and also have implications for privacy, especially since in most social networks profile images are public by default.","inCitations":["9a47e665a54dcf5c5bf32b087bb317e9a72df1d3"],"pmid":"","title":"How Smart Does Your Profile Image Look?: Estimating Intelligence from Social Network Profile Images","journalPages":"33-40","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018663","https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/148867235/WSDM2017_WEI.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09264v2.pdf","https://xw147.github.io/files/WSDM2017-WEI-paper.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09264v3.pdf"],"entities":["Social network","Stereotype (UML)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6f175f7860b3e496b776b3f3f8d03b13775e77f3","491131f063b6d1a8548853628681fbb57bcadab0","83b427459fc5769b869a51f6f530388770ea83c1","4aa2d697f3fa7636b5caa4b20e8a2824b9c046ac","7832c8e75ad51a6414275e2c6a4f62b964c227f1","3f55665f83e6f131bee7ac2e7af8447e1e0aab36","1a998506899da3bc703455bde45114bd4c228947","9d9225d4ee2b67f469271a4ca7de6e0d26b30e07","6958a2deeb7b88675a3da350b5e429703ea4fa5d","b47988df7dc55724fdc603cbb6631086b1008e7c","2c411a12f33f15451e1659a3435391962c0cc144","746279b1d175cb688597eab51a8a28a30efb0535","0f182f7c79455810fe41fd106c8e05dbe5e8790a","1b771544b3b1aa54243e0a1942275bee01f0a9f6","5724aced24e10f371559e0e3b29e1aca76096b24","6ed3db7ddfe2f6ace9775fb7d5d6621cd2c5eb53","1ff15213dac767b0646662d6b9454e06d7837021","1b4b2346279cb5515c508017e6ca3e03f4b3869a","1f9b2f70c24a567207752989c5bd4907442a9d0f","50d7f68422d0c0424674f6b235ac23be8300da38","8e8e10d108c9bfa8b0da59fab4f5b07bb646be62","100511ea26946fb9178e520f76358f3754277583","042a3c235641e08e1f8b369379e99bc5b97b4797","21a93665646aa6d104b68e5803b9604a56972dec","3607afdb204de9a5a9300ae98aa4635d9effcda2","1a8ccc23ed73db64748e31c61c69fe23c48a2bb1"],"id":"0cbc3221a07db517c30b9d6605cbe9d103e19955","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0cbc3221a07db517c30b9d6605cbe9d103e19955","authors":[{"name":"Xingjie Wei","ids":["40655450"]},{"name":"David Stillwell","ids":["2567132"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018663"}

There is no equivalent officially published list of accounts from the IRA known to be active in the UK-EU Referendum debate (Brexit), but we found that the troll accounts active on the 2016 US Election also produced content related to Brexit. We found 3,485 tweets from 419 of the accounts listed as IRA accounts which specifically discussed Brexit and related topics such as the EU and migration. We have been collating an archive of tweets related to Brexit since August 2015 and currently have over 70 million tweets. The Brexit referendum took place on the 23rd June 2016 and the UK voted to leave the European Union. We gathered the data using the Twitter API and a selection of hashtags chosen by a panel of academic experts. Currently we have in excess of fifty different hashtags and we add to the set periodically to accurately represent the evolving conversation. Twitter has closed the accounts that were documented in the Senate list meaning that these tweets are no longer available through the webpage or API. Due to Twitter's terms of service we are unable to share specific tweet text or user profile information but our findings, utilising text and metadata from derived and aggregated data, allows us to provide important insights into the behaviour of these trolls.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Russian Troll Hunting in a Brexit Twitter Archive","journalPages":"361-362","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3197026.3203876"],"entities":["Application programming interface","Archive","Hashtag","Internet research","Offset binary","Terms of service","User profile","Web page"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b2c4dbb779753ce84d5d56c2918bd07b9b4fce04","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","2d8e8cc901dd35cb35c1b2d82d008daf37910a4b","1f779bb04bf3510cc8b0fc8f5dba896f5e4e6b95","e059253a7d44ecc0700b23b6f21989fa5cf38bf6"],"id":"555f6a1cedb03c3c1d6f0f6293fdd71b244da151","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/555f6a1cedb03c3c1d6f0f6293fdd71b244da151","authors":[{"name":"Clare Llewellyn","ids":["48465096"]},{"name":"Laura Cram","ids":["34595978"]},{"name":"Adrian Favero","ids":["27629168"]},{"name":"Robin L.

The findings drive us to design a learning method named TOMN to model time expressions. TOMN defines a constituent-based tagging scheme named TOMN scheme with four tags, namely T, O, M, and N, indicating the constituents of time expression, namely Time token,Modifier,Numeral, and the words Outside time expression. In modeling, TOMN assigns a word with a TOMN tag under conditional random fields with minimal features. Essentially, our constituent-based TOMN scheme overcomes the problem of inconsistent tag assignment that is caused by the conventional position-based tagging schemes (e.g., BIO scheme and BILOU scheme). Experiments show that TOMN is equally or more effective than state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, and much more robust on cross-datasets. Moreover, our analysis can explain many empirical observations in other works about time expression recognition and named entity recognition.

Purchase in basket is a common behavior of consumers. Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to model sequential transactions of baskets in next basket recommendation. However, current methods do not track the user's evolving appetite for items explicitly, and they ignore important item attributes such as product category. In this paper, we propose a novel Attribute-aware Neural Attentive Model (ANAM) to address these problems. ANAM adopts an attention mechanism to explicitly model user's evolving appetite for items, and utilizes a hierarchical architecture to incorporate the attribute information. In specific, ANAM utilizes a recurrent neural network to model the user's sequential behavior over time, and relays the user's appetite toward items and their attributes to next basket through attention weights shared across baskets on the two different hierarchies. Experiment results on two public datasets (ıe Ta-Feng and JingDong) demonstrate the effectiveness of our ANAM model for next basket recommendation.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"An Attribute-aware Neural Attentive Model for Next Basket Recommendation","journalPages":"1201-1204","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/sites/default/files/publis/p1201-bai.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210129"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","BasKet Note Pads","Deep learning","Do Not Track","Experiment","Recurrent neural network","Relay"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3be2609d565f436611090bf5201f73543b3d0610","043ae0ffa13c3b6b356a1d2a9859dcf2876388b3","00cbb42367566a70e3c541d93b5873565b9b1288","b59d6ee45a50a5f5dc7be654cb706897e4ff147c","2e37d6b9a02ec31ea22252c37beae410c6b609a8","b7f07166d4fb0d6b09a4a775d5a1b89685cf54c9","946b6fbca1ea1fb99a3c848bfdaf6d7cca03d223"],"id":"ed61f1ae043764e78627fff0af93b9425fd608f4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ed61f1ae043764e78627fff0af93b9425fd608f4","authors":[{"name":"Ting Bai","ids":["50553040"]},{"name":"Jian-Yun Nie","ids":["1807485"]},{"name":"Wayne Xin Zhao","ids":["2542603"]},{"name":"Yutao Zhu","ids":["1900406"]},{"name":"Pan Du","ids":["2407633"]},{"name":"Ji-Rong Wen","ids":["2259699"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210129"}
{"doiUrl":"","venue":"BIRNDL@SIGIR","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2017,"paperAbstract":"In recent years a huge amount of publications and scientific reports has become available through digital libraries and online databases. Digital libraries commonly provide advanced search interfaces, through which researchers can find and explore the most related scientific studies. Even though the publications of a single author can be easily retrieved and explored, understanding how authors have collaborated with each other on specific research topics and to what extent their collaboration have been fruitful is, in general, a challenging task. This paper proposes a new pattern-based approach to analyzing the correlations among the authors of most influential research studies. To this purpose, it analyzes publication data retrieved from digital libraries and online databases by means of an itemset-based data mining algorithm. It automatically extracts patterns representing the most relevant collaborations among authors on specific research topics. Patterns are evaluated and ranked according to the number of citations received by the corresponding publications. The proposed approach was validated in a real case study, i.e., the analysis of scientific literature on genomics. Specifically, we first analyzed scientific studies on genomics acquired from the OMIM database to discover correlations between authors and genes or genetic disorders. Then, the reliability of the discovered patterns was assessed using the PubMed search engine. The results show that, for the majority of the mined patterns, the most influential (top ranked) studies retrieved by performing author-driven PubMed queries range over the same gene/genetic disorder indicated by the top ranked pattern.","inCitations":["77da0ef71f838d93753535848c1d6cf2d08ba5ff","40f780e6f7b21ed1ca1cb973bb797c040a01118d","10f84abbe3790146ce46619c162b92a192b7f6b7"],"pmid":"","title":"Identifying Collaborations among Researchers: a pattern-based approach","journalPages":"56-68","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e6be/30608794895e1adc55ef34ce1cf948831d56.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1888/paper5.pdf","http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~birndl-sigir2017/BIRNDL_Cagliero.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Data mining","Database","Digital library","Library (computing)","MinEd","Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man","PubMed","Scientific literature","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1436850b814dc45cb9262f05549512041b75cc79","5d007cef78d7c209c7e4fec9d09315d09ef680b8","c8fb0b771bd740f82e7306ff48f7b641ce3fc487","92c43bf9bd0e535ab1fc7573dc192e6d4c25728d","99388a0d3beb526a13421ed088743b30a75e2b29","197ef20f1c652589da145a625093e8b31082c470","607d738d4acc726d9e68f37a07b7a9f2b27c90f5","37d5d2b0d392231d7deae1b2a4f13cbf54c9e184","906d1d75cb4ef5b8e2f88e7d4bd33ae646bd75d2","35f7374c1fc743487a76ff5b7cf4479a1ea0b3f2","57e9443d64e2545dbee470a5960017855dc97a5e","3096595380cfc118bb163b74897e13a84d094432","95b934f981771499fb0c425e50d5442c834916be","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","6e31ad98cf839424e152461e7044992604de0d9a","1e602df3d8feec53f155f9001790c77f3fe9c583"],"id":"7f9bfb07582300c6e43293858fb53443a76f9731","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7f9bfb07582300c6e43293858fb53443a76f9731","authors":[{"name":"Luca Cagliero","ids":["1692878"]},{"name":"Paolo Garza","ids":["1712027"]},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Kavoosifar","ids":["3445883"]},{"name":"Elena Baralis","ids":["1750105"]}],"doi":""}

How can we find such users if we do not have much information about the specified location? Although there are varieties of methods to estimate the locations of users, these methods are not directly applicable to this problem because they require collecting a large amount of random tweets and then filter them to obtain a small amount of tweets from such users. In this paper, we propose a framework that incrementally finds such users and continuously collects tweets from them. Our framework is based on the bandit algorithm that adjusts the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, in other words, it simultaneously finds new users in the specified location and collects tweets from already-found users. The experimental results show that the bandit algorithm works well on this problem and outperforms the carefully-designed baselines.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Collecting Non-Geotagged Local Tweets via Bandit Algorithms","journalPages":"2331-2334","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133046"],"entities":["Algorithm","Big data","Entity\u2013relationship model","Experiment","Geotagging","Instagram","Multi-armed bandit"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8bb5698d997267b0b8fcb5eb6f288d06ba6bd000","1b3c86ad6c149941750d97bd72b6b0122c1d8b5e","1a5ced36faee7ae1d0316c0461c50f4ea1317fad","efe79376f3c94dcb73d4208f0bd52a3ee004ac1b","751adca5b4b1ea9fc1f51c0e7ef0f8d702e37988","dd90dee12840f4e700d8146fb111dbc863a938ad","f4bd6691f59eb95c58b6d104d5122158ab7ddaa4","46034a94c55c947c037a9cfd605cabf0a29ebe89","67a77d3242a357571541d39c26d305c5dda89445","24cd9bf35110ff4c8cb3b42f2fec4420efdfd722"],"id":"f571b55349c35ad61f39d26dbc31f8fc0f9aebd8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f571b55349c35ad61f39d26dbc31f8fc0f9aebd8","authors":[{"name":"Saki Ueda","ids":["31453608"]},{"name":"Yuto Yamaguchi","ids":["2278685"]},{"name":"Hiroyuki Kitagawa","ids":["1687013"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133046"}

Since it was introduced in DL-Lite [1], forgetting has become into a major method of extracting modules in DL ontologies. It has been applied in some other domains such as ontology comparison [2]. Given a (consistent) ontology K and a set of concepts and roles F , the result of forgetting is a new ontology K\u2032 that does not contain symbols in F and preserves certain reasoning or query answering tasks. In existing approaches, forgetting is defined for only consistent ontologies. However, ontologies can be error-prone and inconsistent. To our best knowledge, the problem of establishing a framework for inconsistent ontologies has not been investigated yet. In order to provide a definition of forgetting for a possibly inconsistent DL ontology, we could first repair it and then perform standard forgetting on the repaired ontology. However, there are some issues with this naive approach. In particular, it can give unwanted results for some ontologies.","inCitations":["01e6180ccbb070f80d00ab9970a61cfdf0ef91ff"],"pmid":"","title":"Incosistency-Tolerant Forgetting in DL-lite","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3b1d/31bf6b4c43c589aeb546eb89ba19cc0ff1fb.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1963/paper649.pdf"],"entities":["Adobe Flash Lite","Cognitive dimensions of notations","Ontology (information science)","Ontology engineering"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["bfbc91d973b0cfcc5776094740ab0cbe7ca5444d","2a2d6fff0f9c8815db08a658ba486bf7cc2b2aee","28611d868c8c6f4f3f88b5fab67580bd8d5439cd","3fa87b51062bdf973d2af0dc082e9461251462e6","280b29926f6eb3625f2da1213039f04c6ff91b54","04cc96adb8c164f60b7c0031c1f9dc3ca41bd308"],"id":"3b1d31bf6b4c43c589aeb546eb89ba19cc0ff1fb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b1d31bf6b4c43c589aeb546eb89ba19cc0ff1fb","authors":[{"name":"Peng Xiao","ids":["1727879"]},{"name":"Kewen Wang","ids":["34241570"]},{"name":"Zhe Wang","ids":["40072288"]}],"doi":""}

Fitted from a training corpus of text documents by a generalization of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the utilized model is able to deal with domain{specific synonymy as well as with polysemous words. In contrast to standard Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Singular Value Decomposition, the probabilistic variant has a solid statistical foundation and defines a proper generative data model. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections indicate substantial performance gains over direct term matching methods as well as over LSI.

We apply grounded theory principles to analyze 75 articles authored by library administrators, librarians with IT expertise, IT professionals, cybersecurity experts, and business consultants engaged in planning, deploying, and maintaining library services in the cloud. Data analysis reveals that a majority of the past literature reports challenges to implementing Software as a Service (SaaS) in libraries. The seven key areas critical to the successful implementation of SaaS in libraries are related to: (1) data, (2) authentication and privacy of patrons, (3) skills and knowledge of library staff and organizational culture, (4) IT infrastructure, (5) features of services, (6) fixed and operational costs associated with data and technology, and (7) policies and contracts. Data issues like access, storage, ownership, curation, security, confidentiality, loss, migration, and redundancy seem to have the most influence on SaaS deployment in libraries.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Challenges to Deploying Library Services in the Cloud: Data Issues Influencing IT, People, Costs, and Policy Challenges","journalPages":"375-376","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3197026.3203897"],"entities":["Authentication","Cloud computing","Computer security","Confidentiality","Digital curation","Librarian","Library (computing)","Software as a service","Software deployment"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d9ce20e750df2c51c6585cb2d8700f606760be45","4f6577ead70ef97d620dec986cf054ae4a05035d","6fb23bc0f739108d777d7831ae90aef6699aae20","77ea324bd53acd919edc96a89959643f717d1537","08d84b4db24c37ab3e4774563d3051b243a7376d"],"id":"091fb6bdb15aa3e485d210bbb73e4eba98546d5e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/091fb6bdb15aa3e485d210bbb73e4eba98546d5e","authors":[{"name":"Devendra Potnis","ids":["2706156"]},{"name":"Reynard Regenstreif-Harms","ids":["46243911"]},{"name":"Dwight Hunter","ids":["46384679"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3197026.3203897"}

This is a complex exercise that requires characterising with a high precision the topics of thousands of books and matching them with the interests of the relevant communities. In Springer Nature, this task has been traditionally handled manually by publishing editors. However, the rapid growth in the number of scientific publications and the dynamic nature of the Computer Science landscape has made this solution increasingly inefficient. We have addressed this issue by creating Smart Book Recommender (SBR), an ontologybased recommender system developed by The Open University (OU) in collaboration with Springer Nature, which supports their Computer Science editorial team in selecting the products to market at specific venues. SBR recommends books, journals, and conference proceedings relevant to a conference by taking advantage of a semantically enhanced representation of about 27K editorial products. This is based on the Computer Science Ontology, a very large-scale, automatically generated taxonomy of research areas.

Here, assessing the degree of semantic relatedness between words is an important task. However, many existing relatedness measures only encode information contained in the underlying corpus and thus do not directly model human intuition. To solve this, we propose RRL (Relative Relatedness Learning) to improve existing semantic relatedness measures by learning from explicit human feedback. Human feedback about semantic relatedness is extracted from the publicly available MEN dataset. The core result is that we can generalize human intuition on datasets such as MEN using RRL. This way, we can significantly outperform semantic relatedness scores produced by current state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Learning Semantic Relatedness from Human Feedback Using Relative Relatedness Learning","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/22a2/2ef5c38f05455779a6a43f2c16c23e6574ff.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.dmir.uni-wuerzburg.de/staff/niebler/publications1/?cHash=e885f67701b17b2d0973e375baba6b89&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5Baction%5D=download&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Document&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BfileName%5D=poster_iswc.pdf&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BintraHash%5D=56c721f147f43b28cbe5b052dcdfd942&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BuserName%5D=thoni","http://www.dmir.uni-wuerzburg.de/projects/posts_i_ii/publications/?cHash=52d77e573743b0c4d10fcfdad53e7a93&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5Baction%5D=download&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Document&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BfileName%5D=poster_iswc.pdf&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BintraHash%5D=56c721f147f43b28cbe5b052dcdfd942&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BuserName%5D=dmir","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1963/paper471.pdf","http://www.dmir.uni-wuerzburg.de/staff/becker/?cHash=c73b3036d7d0e0475e6075dad44c0d44&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5Baction%5D=download&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Document&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BfileName%5D=paper471.pdf&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BintraHash%5D=4ec9c8e9704a48bed604c8231c55c266&tx_extbibsonomycsl_publicationlist%5BuserName%5D=becker"],"entities":["ENCODE","Ontology (information science)","Rich Representation Language","Semantic Web","Semantic similarity","Text corpus"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["26aa6fe2028b5eefbaa40ab54ef725bbbe7d9810","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","83a768a0720d0a1f68792827a422395001291614","20b45efa943a472afba17092fa000f06e9417d01"],"id":"5e6b8f433497b540fcb59690da3cc643b4c43029","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5e6b8f433497b540fcb59690da3cc643b4c43029","authors":[{"name":"Thomas Niebler","ids":["2502754"]},{"name":"Martin Becker","ids":["38822389"]},{"name":"Christian Pölitz","ids":["2028516"]},{"name":"Andreas Hotho","ids":["1792623"]}],"doi":""}

Established approaches usually deal with synthetic differences like typos and abbreviations, but neglect the semantic relations between words. Such relations, however, are helpful for obtaining high-quality joining results. In this paper, we leverage the taxonomy knowledge (i.e., a set of IS-A hierarchical relations) to define a similarity measure which finds semantic-similar records from two datasets. Based on this measure, we develop a similarity join algorithm with prefix filtering framework to prune away irrelevant pairs effectively. Our technical contribution here is an algorithm that judiciously selects critical parameters in a prefix filter to maximise its filtering power, supported by an estimation technique and Monte Carlo simulation process.

Particularly interesting are the cognitive constraints associated with the interactions between the ego and the members of their ego network, whereby individuals cannot maintain meaningful interactions with more than 150 people, on average. In this work, we focus on the ego networks of journalists on Twitter, and we investigate whether they feature the same characteristics observed for other relevant classes of Twitter users, like politicians and generic users. Our findings are that journalists are generally more active and interact with more people than generic users. Their ego network structure is very aligned with reference models derived from the social brain hypothesis and observed in general human ego networks. Remarkably, the similarity is even higher than the one of politicians and generic users ego networks. This may imply a greater cognitive involvement with Twitter than with other social interaction means. Moreover, the ego networks of journalists are much stabler than those of politicians and generic users, and the ego-alter ties are often information-driven.

Salient thumbnails may offer a modest advantage over the baseline for re-finding tasks, but their overall suitability for representing a digital archive online depends on the user and task at hand.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Exploring Salient Thumbnail Generation for Archival Collections Online","journalPages":"1-2","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3200382"],"entities":["Archive","Baseline (configuration management)","Open-source software","Thumbnail"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f5aaee2a758f14df056994464a35e832c53116df","871276456c78ad25a068b75d11ea8eb081cf3786","6e2e87a19b867dbf5d22650fe1f21389522880cd","b73f2d7b58bfc555d8037b3fdb673c4cec1aecf0","0ca6ba6ef10fccde0e69f8aaac45f5291456abb4"],"id":"defbc81ca5404b9a34e21f0c89645a7515f4e552","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/defbc81ca5404b9a34e21f0c89645a7515f4e552","authors":[{"name":"Bailey Jones","ids":["40165478"]},{"name":"Robert G.

Access control is one of the key techniques that can mitigate security concerns for web based applications. However, most existing access control mechanisms require a trusted party, which are vulnerable to many threats including malicious insiders and single point failure. In response to these challenges, we propose DL-BAC, a novel access control system based on the distributed ledger. DL-BAC robustly enforces access control policies without depending on a single trusted party. We also provide an extension of DL-BAC that is privacy respecting and evaluate the performance of DL-BAC to show its practicability.","inCitations":["6bea18daaca014a6c65d5e3e59c15955babf6a35","cb0bbf8a60da20d4b06f35c8218a760dfa053449","b5f4a2e91a08dc28f21c9fa9543655e7edcc0d75","638a69347cface9d0b6744774676a6ad3a2da25d"],"pmid":"","title":"DL-BAC: Distributed Ledger Based Access Control for Web Applications","journalPages":"1445-1450","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ac6a/7075814f31ca2825eaef461c0d051c2a1456.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1445.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3053897"],"entities":["Access control","Batman: Arkham City","Cloud computing","Control system","Internet","Malware","Single point of failure"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6bcd2606c8f0099a82bd03e520659058a5b12e51","fd87f7aa1b1b6c44e6effd2efb59f5a81e2e3541","14ee6a52b24d2f6160865871284421a2fbcbb497","2a00b980487af499182ae8de9304e8cb6a91766c","2730e6b622528b3d308e5855d5a94b0ed90875a2","1ccef9fa75e519daa10618fe9f2d7a46a34a7040","4fc849841e0df1126cc5258924af4d57023758f5","577078ea7093df8ff6dcfd10185ef3b60ecbda7b","efe573cbfa7f4de4fd31eda183fefa8a7aa80888","60682144f3554174654248c4dd46db46e5b1cd37","1cbbd3291a09c7569e54e1c4c6a9184ca517ab94","02700bb52ebf06b5b881a2b4c189bd8a4f047874","78747f200efa7275fe84ae5c7b5ed193a175f031","efb1a85cf540fd4f901a78100a2e450d484aebac","ec4c62fe581cd1ba4e6ba2ed165a148b745f1a4c","f2d698c5a1819b0cff0c8899b8a391c5721aa2b6","59a87aac6c13e4b3587a416fe18d03a00b3ec053","565365c7ba45fc4e1132b3c09b52c556251059b8","278c758c0b9471a6e54bdbed33a1c6b7d5eb0d58","b994f6b61178a9d55d96ed800cdc7d0bedd1609e","31445e3bd3672ed743c4a089cc0db4f23357f0f2","b947a73f28264000d6220a88789b04030f799d0b","1ee8022f86319f170be9dac984e228cd52abdfd8","3d84ff3226430aef1bd42ffb29d5716ac3a7b3d0","61a666644815df1ed220d2712c8862497ffc52a0","604d0e34dd8ad68d047793b7bf550757c191cfd0","261893f4c8a7c311a97249a8f42071c566372493","3f8b7a114ddbcc3f0cb07a3a1b971cc5814463fe","259603d8d1c2a6d439eb8fa5038659a94aac08e1","2327ad6f237b37150e84f0d745a05565ebf0b24d","bae628a3f83d8bb6be80f68345e112a601be1555","0bc34e01051417e224dcfe6d6ea890d5dcae2684","e27851fab570962f9f31eb3f5cea4055c63d041a"],"id":"ac6a7075814f31ca2825eaef461c0d051c2a1456","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ac6a7075814f31ca2825eaef461c0d051c2a1456","authors":[{"name":"Lei Xu","ids":["38047819"]},{"name":"Lin Chen","ids":["47818310"]},{"name":"Nolan Shah","ids":["10360056"]},{"name":"Zhimin Gao","ids":["49538629"]},{"name":"Yang Lu","ids":["48517864"]},{"name":"Weidong Shi","ids":["1680288"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3053897"}

Generally in search engines, utilization of semantics between words is favorable for performance improvement. Even though ambiguous query words have multiple semantic meanings, search engines can return diversified results to satisfy different users' information needs. But for CitySearcher, mismatched semantic relationships can lead to extremely unsatisfactory results. For example, the city Sale would incorrectly rank high for the interest shopping because of semantic interpretations of the words. Thus in our system, the main challenge is to eliminate the mismatched semantic relationships resulting from the side effect of the semantic models. In the previous case, we aim to ignore the semantics of a city's name which is not indicative of the city's characteristics. In CitySearcher, we use word2vec, a very popular word embedding technique to estimate the semantics of the words and create the initial ranks of the cities. To reduce the effect of the mismatched semantic relationships, we generate a set of features for learning based on a novel clustering-based method. With the generated features, we then utilize learning to rank algorithms to rerank the cities for return. We use the English version of Wikivoyage dataset for evaluation of our system, where we sample a very small dataset for training. Experimental results demonstrate the performance gain of our system over various standard retrieval techniques.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"CitySearcher: A City Search Engine For Interests","journalPages":"1141-1144","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080742"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cluster analysis","Experiment","Information needs","Learning to rank","Semantic data model","Test set","Vocabulary","Web search engine","Word embedding","Word2vec"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","8f3e8a99eff5862e02413028ad265d1be06772bb","6a3a0f0b6e92f0ae5444b96cb055cb40978c2141","1944fda0d2aad86fdfac5f3c0d5c3b4055fa1336","073daaf4f6fa972d3bdee3c4e4510d21dc934dfb","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","e50a316f97c9a405aa000d883a633bd5707f1a34","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","22d1e8ecaf4b42cd761aecbaf736190a6e680470"],"id":"532ce7d9d285dd642fe8393bace90a13cfebf6dd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/532ce7d9d285dd642fe8393bace90a13cfebf6dd","authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Abdel Maksoud","ids":["3107034"]},{"name":"Gaurav Pandey","ids":["2686270"]},{"name":"Shuaiqiang Wang","ids":["2386396"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080742"}

One instance of this is the analysis of Twitter data, in particular when specific tweets are reproduced for the purposes of dissemination. Although Twitter is an open platform it is possible to question whether this provides a sufficient ethical justification to collect, analyse and reproduce tweets for the purposes of research or whether it is necessary to also undertake specific informed consent procedures. This paper reports on an ethics consultation that formed part of a wider research study and that aimed to identify best practice procedures for the publication of Twitter data in research findings. We focus largely on the UK context and draw on the outcomes of the consultation to highlight the range and depth of ethical issues that arise in this area. We can see Twitter as a case study for a wide number of data sources used in Web Science. This is a highly complex landscape in which questions crystallise around fundamental principles such as informed consent, anonymisation and the minimisation of harm. Furthermore, tensions exist between commercial, regulatory and academic practices, and there are also circumstances in which good ethical practice might compromise academic integrity. There is an absence of consensus in Web science and related fields over how to resolve these issues and we argue that constructive debate is necessary in order to take a proactive approach towards good practice.","inCitations":["0b4d9d99e147db25e90f4a49851f390eee0121c9","f05f1dd13d9e6a1ea6fc2f0c6d725513bffd4160","b8e145efcd7ef438a7cc6dc156df521e10f088cb","3ce2f77f3b04005e2cc416e8cc5d85b86546ffae"],"pmid":"","title":"The Ethical Challenges of Publishing Twitter Data for Research Dissemination","journalPages":"339-348","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091489","http://orca-mwe.cf.ac.uk/102243/1/Housley_Ethical%20challenges%20of%20Twitter%20data.pdf"],"entities":["Best practice","Internet","Open platform","ProActive Parallel Suite","Report","Web science"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["599a60a03899f23df61dbd2de1b71174b51ef207","39bd78efe37005f331f8ff287b637e51a9f91819","e0e6a478994cf8de86038f52a03a234dbeff98f3","fac76c3b351509dbb541a87922743bf3d9fb5b2e","69425398ced540f9c62a122b1395cc5a42149c19","683cd1b2ad314c2f7eabd9801bdf24ea4c75074b","909982acb048c31bb23f15955d4051b6c12d9631","00e399699c48c15bd70c7c32a223b06d27cbcb48"],"id":"baf62cb4a8ddbbc94f3805fa469af1849f59fc09","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/baf62cb4a8ddbbc94f3805fa469af1849f59fc09","authors":[{"name":"Helena Webb","ids":["48887827"]},{"name":"Marina Jirotka","ids":["1771117"]},{"name":"Bernd Carsten Stahl","ids":["1792014"]},{"name":"William Housley","ids":["2923143"]},{"name":"Adam Edwards","ids":["38446173"]},{"name":"Matthew L.

There has been a considerable increase in interest for the better understanding and modeling of networks, and the vast majority of existing work has been for unsigned networks. However, many networks can have positive and negative links (or signed networks), especially in online social media. It is evident from recent work that signed networks present unique properties and principles from unsigned networks due to the added complexity, which pose tremendous challenges on existing unsigned network models. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the problem of modeling signed networks. In particular, we provide a principled approach to capture important properties and principles of signed networks and propose a novel signed network model guided by Structural Balance Theory. Empirical experiments on three real-world signed networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.","inCitations":["2bf7ecbbd4933ccda98af8d9f79457587e98e315"],"pmid":"","title":"Signed Network Modeling Based on Structural Balance Theory","journalPages":"557-566","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09485v3.pdf","http://www.cse.msu.edu/~derrtyle/papers/cikm18-signed_network_modeling.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271746","http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09485"],"entities":["Balance theory","Bitcoin","Degree distribution","Experiment","Generative model","LU decomposition","Network model","Over-the-counter (finance)","Social media","Social network","Unbalanced circuit"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["85199f47fc3a9e0bf460d74c354f7d5c14d7a7cc","45d84d67870fc5de3b0747d05d9971d750604e7e","45fa829fc7aa9c37190c4289bdf01efbb7019da5","6752d625f2427ccd14043d7719118a3b4aa14164","beeec44ca86a97dd60c9be4508c082f9a6f3114f","0041adeb171b36f7ef568b6934ea3f4263163c05","0ae0e218d634ccd5d49c462603361957f2ea117c","85e5ecf51d561f59ea98f3a3d9cdb1dc31caccd7","189ef562597987ef484b43ff2c9d3fca6b797309","2b98beb92b3fd808571d42d3514ff916a0a17366","af0bd35e17419a8bad3e6245a846a1e876b9b4a1","8ee710f20ad2d156ed848bae97917d17ee4d2c15","6ea8894ef9edf31ed83e925a5650a0a8f0b79b76","a151fcaa3d003321d6e09602a927fc434d19b032","28dd3e75ac352ae448b68a17b78a7e101f50b8fe","0fb926cae217b70c97c74eb70b2a6b8c47574812","71b64035eacf2986ca7c153ebec72eb781a23931","1521d39088b203ddac981d10d214f463449ae95b","79068c97c0b111d4eefc0e1d87f706df55c9bfed","0b0641043cb2b660f5613005ed6f916533573108","3e8867b73bb1a64fc573c5e882d63639c71e11c6","29d0f0556502566f1615ff347b5f568bce46063a","2628a4ab8be64bdc71d6cf9d537586d28053db86","6466d4d16cbda9e5ba9e7253c66908313629f028","350bdb162f1a02791db10ad887b84fdf231c92e5","eff3e2a802a63b15ce57498611165eccca0ddbe3"],"id":"e545db3bc0eebad045eba1ca5a1e7e5bc4c731d8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e545db3bc0eebad045eba1ca5a1e7e5bc4c731d8","authors":[{"name":"Tyler Derr","ids":["12524628"]},{"name":"Charu C.

International Conference on Web Search & Data Mining","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"year":2017,"paperAbstract":"Many of today's most widely used computing applications utilize social networking features and allow users to connect, follow each other, share content, and comment on others' posts. However, despite the widespread adoption of these features, there is little understanding of the consequences that social networking has on user retention, engagement, and online as well as offline behavior.\n Here, we study how social networks influence user behavior in a physical activity tracking application. We analyze 791 million online and offline actions of 6 million users over the course of 5 years, and show that social networking leads to a significant increase in users' online as well as offline activities. Specifically, we establish a causal effect of how social networks influence user behavior. We show that the creation of new social connections increases user online in-application activity by 30%, user retention by 17%, and user offline real-world physical activity by 7% (about 400 steps per day). By exploiting a natural experiment we distinguish the effect of social influence of new social connections from the simultaneous increase in user's motivation to use the app and take more steps. We show that social influence accounts for 55% of the observed changes in user behavior, while the remaining 45% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to use the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in the social network lead to significant increases in daily steps. These effects diminish with each additional edge and vary based on edge attributes and user demographics. Finally, we utilize these insights to develop a model that accurately predicts which users will be most influenced by the creation of new social network connections.","inCitations":["226146b6e35cbd16a653ed00cab4b0fa8c70e564","89b73458dcff07099db29f9435c82ca469a25b53","303a4622b9ad74f3a9a2b9dd4a63119153c56f5f","418331c61a5186314580d2d871f9859c61c2042e","7785559fccddd0f54d47f3131cf16417fb7f658c","aac1b8e1b9ee3f7f5f447520c64a649cba6cbb7a","069313181e7cd7c76cc6f0254fb03b7d119bfff2","087846516fdf387d6ec07a59f477e43d9f853e56","52b3b351dcaf8d41cbe7682ae0574a35429f5adf","490fd3e8259e93d15c289e3f806c2bc93456df15","464fc754881f6ca2cdfd679a52f472566198cb30","bdf8283eb3ee9f58e56b92300717ce4084128d1f","4bdd6090c2a6786a7e299842443ae31ff47a857d","327aff96f48dbfb95b728e84b108c04e95067f65","d0b8a5207ab63148af861c7f2c9b59be72e299e0","4c361f5b425f1092b7778f948b0ca2779c331830","13db7eed1e89caceaa7788d6cf16fc758cc7b55f","b274d91d49231849b6bde4f1af536b3282711de9","35adc17fec5f0bc5fdab254b952a504a6246d5e4","465348392a3bee4acfac41709dfd10877633960b","09f021684924ff7cce5c08329c4d9df2240ff60d","4dcbfe41682fce6aa275f20d93cc268fa8d4e49c","262a5a784eedb127490f44736844a33123b30fe0","c07b2b4f9352164bbdc268b9c4cdc64257f5f721","63587eb4a26220c7909fafb73836556f90edced1","c06e980a91c8b1b900bbd1f7b9c9ac443720cd6b"],"pmid":"28345078v1","title":"Online Actions with Offline Impact: How Online Social Networks Influence Online and Offline User Behavior","journalPages":"\n          537-546\n        ","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018672","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03053v2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03053v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03053","http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/social-influence-wsdm17.pdf"],"entities":["Causal filter","Demography","Exercise","Online and offline","REM Sleep Behavior Disorder","Social network"],"journalVolume":"2017","outCitations":["24d3f6c7d46a351919a845b2bf62da1b10c05e19","087846516fdf387d6ec07a59f477e43d9f853e56","1a48cfe2da6f5f0b79b332525e9df699c07a2ec4","1e54e8c5ed809b2b50da37a4c9b93a4aa87f5805","1068facb3bb9db48c6ff841647d5030c43e4e0c7","315a061bf865e25e27c245f1b1db2ce75b740d57","09031aa6d6743bebebc695955cd77c032cd9192f","2691890e9181740ebaef8cdc3e4badde7469227c","0e1ebbf27b303b8ccf62176e6e9370261963e2c0","471e9d18671d713528bf2255eba68476d5acdf2f","b10b6f4349bb1d70654aeb2d26d6f1128aed437c","d2744804056664257e4097ce60f5560e62797b39","3b090460441b8eb0700675ec7672035ef51bc23f","1002b31ed19a0e7373908fb620859a00bcdb1c90","f3c8b3acb61b2e13ed1140469195758b48d97592","7945aa5d69fd0a516c321f005a89a2d0b9a72fa8","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","7d6901658c53e40165c5a3a966c9eb2ab9d004fe","36d3641ca326b053625478affa405148aeda6fef","5e30bba6ff2bdf63814bf581ad1e82f6fc627af9","67739eab6289ca65f05a0747433c25b892962cb9","8aff130073bff584f63785f23f80583a32b6733d","a71f6d2d49eda16193bf5578662c11d3ed986355","46132b59a8031452455260acb8348779b0cf1375","0a6057b716fd225f9fb8e902d7c12f50b7ec4aed","1ea41b79140d9e6a5956d1302feb4a8c76c29a3d","1558a06fb4f0473f76792e830b0b07c79f7decc0","fca783b1228407c4ec9ae0b7d9c65d5d3f1e67d0","939e62c549525607e2906c571650f6496067d2bf","4587d4722317acd4e2a90b12f58ccc9de1ecc6ee","00f1ee4a4264480edc8355a26b8dfbbdfc2b33aa","1a7a1bdbebb97c839554419211fd942618a8bc06","3a33073e111f690c0fc6e1fad90b6018fa84e793","6053788472fc36ecce57e2a72e3d84987765fa81","83eec57453afd8774aaf9b9007a961a9d378bb02","216e92be827a9774130263754f2036aab0808484","72b992cd5b0461d3922d61aba4e13fd71fd9bb79","05d63702a8034f2bce76a2db4ddeb94be87f0009","04c989763bdcba7534001333b4abcf0542270f84","0ff9c0c8426fe8508f8356dfd4af3bfc6fde76c8","1073c29baf6d9cfc7b7b028024b58ed070696da3","206caa3a3ec1a15ae6280707c05c750fa100300f","076ddb6d7b62ed5d4600dae6422184c1bc61e395","370b71fa394789e2d2fb424d76ccad16975cc34d","1765178cfbf8c1052daa726da87e0034738d2193"],"id":"129d75bbcfb5da706adbdd90ce87262e99e537a2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/129d75bbcfb5da706adbdd90ce87262e99e537a2","authors":[{"name":"Tim Althoff","ids":["1745524"]},{"name":"Pranav Jindal","ids":["50435146"]},{"name":"Jure Leskovec","ids":["1702139"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3018661.3018672"}

In order to reduce storage requirements, we propose a dictionary-based compression approach for the recently proposed bitwise data-structure BitFunnel, which makes use of a Bloom filter. Compression is achieved through storing frequently occurring blocks in a dictionary. Infrequently occurring blocks (those which are not represented in the dictionary) are instead referenced using similar blocks that are in the dictionary, introducing additional false positive errors. We further introduce a docID reordering strategy to improve compression. Experimental results indicate an improvement in compression by 27% to 30%, at the expense of increasing the query processing time by 16% to 48% and increasing the false positive rate by around 7.6 to 10.7 percentage points.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Index Compression for BitFunnel Query Processing","journalPages":"921-924","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210086"],"entities":["Bitwise operation","Bloom filter","Data dictionary","Data structure","Database","Inverted index","Requirement","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":[],"id":"54dfd9689745a6b846f27e7e25280fd3ed444fef","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/54dfd9689745a6b846f27e7e25280fd3ed444fef","authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Liu","ids":["1704461"]},{"name":"Zhaohua Zhang","ids":["7969749"]},{"name":"Boran Hou","ids":["35318049"]},{"name":"Rebecca J.

In this paper we discuss the NTCIR-13 Actionable Knowledge Graph (AKG) task and its test collections. The task focuses on finding possible actions related to input entities as well as the relevant properties of such actions.

However, the problem of using cognitive analysis to distill the knowledge and gaming factor from students learning history is still underexplored. To this end, we propose a Knowledge Plus Gaming Response Model (KPGRM) based on multiple-attempt responses. Specifically, we first measure the explicit gaming factor in each multiple-attempt response. Next, we utilize collaborative filtering methods to infer the implicit gaming factor of oneattempt responses. Then we model student learning cognitively by considering both gaming and knowledge factors simultaneously based on a signal detection model. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets prove that KPGRM can model student learning more effectively as well as obtain a more reasonable analysis.","inCitations":["aa3a38d249af59b12e75f2f2e9195b008a460f87","2ecf7395f10df2d5e26f619d2e45644386ba647e","41c828743f69c0ec53f59c42704f427ac879613b","18f73dacf0cdb3660f1e37fefba58a661660eaa8","cca3bea68e2df58aff00a9753306693ea8db99e5"],"pmid":"","title":"Knowledge or Gaming?: Cognitive Modelling Based on Multiple-Attempt Response","journalPages":"321-329","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c5b2/71c12b20e309ab1300aceba733bbdf7a25b4.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p321.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054156","https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/105700/1/Knowledge%20or%20Gaming%3F%20Cognitive%20Modelling%20Based%20on%20Multiple-Attempt%20Response.pdf"],"entities":["Cognitive model","Collaborative filtering","Detection theory","Experiment","Personalization"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["56b165f388a3dbc365f3104854786988b57ea468","308e6dbbc4436e96453110897b97a9ae79b413a6","07ab612722603596d5637b4aa35464ccc8df34a7","f07438ccf83207c614e25522377cbc7d04e3842e","3053f2473b0e35dbd6e031e0d2eda5f0d6eb3093","645b2c28c28bd28eaa187a2faafa5ec12bc12e3a","2e37d6b9a02ec31ea22252c37beae410c6b609a8","2b68bf0ea8fc04a49f23547b0b41308bdb02abe9","6bbeee57718a372b0af860333d476f5c9e6df43a","9abd719fa36b6150ec0b6efc6492f9ecbc1f64d6","7443ed91f8cc23747eca573dc70dcbb13fa2e327","ce46ebfa2b34fc709b6d113c5fe8d4e76f11d692","477af853bb1f43fde8572a20569ecd0cfe86c6d8","1c4081269d539ec83390e649142acd50a35318b4","4dc175e8f6e7ca5c40ffd6fb9c6b92323bf7daf2","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","0f7d4def5f2de8c43ea3a6bc1fe6cd5bf73f312e","a35b77d64b8ce98d4dbe125c52fc239d79a2e496","166fba9c0abb92addf4dcac76cdcd8b4204e0fa5","d33d3ea779fd536eb22b5919d284012b3fec354a","2b20b3db2b75317190a88da3ce3cebc04bb87a20","f2b13976ee493ae0af9598cc3dfd27bfecaa874d","64c871cd7e0af7e1aeb94d98c6214eb8d8e8b989","487c56cca45fc9fad6b1f95879ef8d635f479f0d","1ca022418e7d23ad6891d9279e1c6d28171f59ad","098c57f75479813c2cdc848ab16ef41d87353702","143d2e02ab91ae6259576ac50b664b8647af8988","dfc8ee7380eaf4019869b221eaeb299a89f31262","02f63887e71f885e6c47313083cf729589e46b6d","b104f1bf5809f2a5246c6637e7913c2a1bf65cc3"],"id":"c5b271c12b20e309ab1300aceba733bbdf7a25b4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c5b271c12b20e309ab1300aceba733bbdf7a25b4","authors":[{"name":"Run-ze Wu","ids":["33810418"]},{"name":"Guandong Xu","ids":["1747560"]},{"name":"Enhong Chen","ids":["1703319"]},{"name":"Qi Feng Liu","ids":["39001617"]},{"name":"Wan Ng","ids":["35149413"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054156"}

We have harvested a large corpus of query logs with different lineage and sizes, from DBPedia to BioPortal and Wikidata, whose total number of queries amounts to 180M. We ran a wide range of analyses on the corpus, spanning from simple tasks (keyword counts, triple counts, operator distributions), moderately deep tasks (projection test, query classification), and deep analysis (shape analysis, well-designedness, weakly welldesignedness, hypertreewidth, and fractional edge cover). The key goal of our demonstration is to let the users dive into the SPARQL query logs of our corpus and let them discover the inherent characteristics of the queries. The entire corpus of SPARQL queries is stored in a DBMS. The tool has a GUI that allows users to ask sophisticated analytical queries on the SPARQL logs. These analytical queries can both be directly written in SQL or composed by a visual query builder tool. The results of the analytical queries are represented both textually (as SPARQL queries) and visually. The DBMS performs the searches within the corpus quite efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of this kind on such a large corpus and with such a number of varied tests.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"DARQL: Deep Analysis of SPARQL Queries","journalPages":"187-190","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3186975"],"entities":["DBpedia","Edge cover","File spanning","Graphical user interface","Lineage (evolution)","SPARQL","SQL","Shape analysis (digital geometry)","Text corpus","Web query classification","Wikidata"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["96db28d5673e3b3f8b0b643343dd3c48e5f79807","300583e2ecc23410a01d06b2006a78746918672d","079c3a520f2a102adec40c623a5acf1e6943a5db","ae8fde2f61212fc808a7f246cc36edca6aaa129e"],"id":"870666329e4ec6ba4a9b6e1380bd1d6365975d58","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/870666329e4ec6ba4a9b6e1380bd1d6365975d58","authors":[{"name":"Angela Bonifati","ids":["1699192"]},{"name":"Wim Martens","ids":["1749142"]},{"name":"Thomas Timm","ids":["49043107"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3186975"}
{"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186114","venue":"WWW","journalName":"","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2018,"paperAbstract":"There are increasing interests in learning low-dimensional and dense node representations from the network structure which is usually high-dimensional and sparse. However, most existing methods fail to consider semantic meanings of links. Different links may have different semantic meanings because the similarities between two nodes can be different, e.g., two nodes share common neighbors and two nodes share similar interests which are demonstrated in node-generated content. In this paper, the former type of links are referred to as structure-close links while the latter type are referred to as content-close links. These two types of links naturally indicate there are two types of characteristics that nodes expose in a social network. Hence, we propose to learn two representations for each node, and render each representation responsible for encoding the corresponding type of node characteristics, which is achieved by jointly embedding the network structure and inferring the type of each link. In the experiments, the proposed method is demonstrated to be more effective than five recent methods on four social networks through applications including visualization, link prediction and multi-label classification.","inCitations":["0efedf8a4d8119e8ffe8294aab7c1c832326a46e","df84fff20c6183cb47b3c6da2ec984749cb1c21b","74e34e0e4540e8f5d5fa580f6aba4aa361f95802","5ab04cd62d6aa94d7920f9488769b560c30cac97","00e14b6b7fcbe461727dc57975b8b18f92d851fc"],"pmid":"","title":"On Exploring Semantic Meanings of Links for Embedding Social Networks","journalPages":"479-488","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ccd3/ede78393628b5f0256ebfccbb4ac293394de.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186114","http://www2.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslcxu/papers/IIRL.pdf"],"entities":["Categorization","Experiment","IBM Notes","Multi-label classification","Social network","Sparse matrix","User-generated content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c3d62bcb84fc3a2aa9b8f4691677d7c02738f1bc","db9eeca431c423a644a145f5722019570996ce04","6d80ef8acc96ea380c9592d9a01bd965c2ba2604","41a08affbb5c847d6f2a82d5ae4be9ed5df52353","aad9c378dc1485957ae8d661596462b2ec16ab24","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","a0775fab3b20f2dc0ac2f2626552d046b6afc225","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","2317a28a52d8fc9b9d2367831c3a3cd79429e56d","18fff5656201c4d1f70695d688ce9718dfa6985b","0217fb2a54a4f324ddf82babc6ec6692a3f6194f","10eb7bfa7687f498268bdf74b2f60020a151bdc6","d3e0d596efd9d19b93d357565a68dfa925dce2bb","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73","5fae7e4c82e89908417c5188f1509f3f87f46a88","f421ebe6b502c42820b0d4028304b5843f70def9","9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d","74e34e0e4540e8f5d5fa580f6aba4aa361f95802","34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","2cbe0ba73d02aabbeefedf841203219796a551b7","23b7288ff0a454ac0ea08b62b5436255a78fd24c","2337c65e651a909d7176ee083d368bcb4099b125","42e8632424b0ead9ff52c3ed1fe5faee1e9e65f4","8117433f035c9254e37d316d7b57b1580cff8c5e","71b64035eacf2986ca7c153ebec72eb781a23931","0710099aee18aabc0605c52628c29ac5ad94ec60","85b3193e329b7017cde6856b5cbbd3ff6e19f8f9","c2fd72cb2a77941e655b5d949d0d59b01e173c3b","0c7f1d285ce069b2f7a807a4b2750695098bffe6","03ce9b83f0b5fe98e5795a909bbf2ef35af0cbf3","03cb609fcfce6c60cbe3eb0dd8254069bf6d7573","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","33efd3ecffca21efaf9d1469b7dc3d2a72a0a05e","0ffef82576452eac1a8e48edaabf08282426d100","18ca2837d280a6b2250024b6b0e59345601064a7","1eb6538c7fa6a41923869924a55c95036f06c9a0","05f61ff006f195baaf59eb6b87d3561c6ec8d71a","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","d0b7c8828f0fca4dd901674e8fb5bd464a187664","ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","2633008bab38abb29d0e9588d3ad8f65cce96fcb","b7b9196227cdf2f55bd5b6fac373c9127ccb7b57","08eeaae7108e35a9639ef750a75132d0c71b2dd1"],"id":"ccd3ede78393628b5f0256ebfccbb4ac293394de","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ccd3ede78393628b5f0256ebfccbb4ac293394de","authors":[{"name":"Linchuan Xu","ids":["8834417"]},{"name":"Xiaokai Wei","ids":["2336542"]},{"name":"Jiannong Cao","ids":["1780398"]},{"name":"Philip S.

The project is following a multi-disciplinary, industry-driven approach to the analysis and understanding of learner data in order to personalize, accelerate and improve informal learning processes. Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining traditionally relate to the analysis and exploration of data coming from learning environments, especially to understand learners\u2019 behaviours. However, studies have for a long time demonstrated that learning activities happen outside of formal educational platforms, also. This includes informal and collective learning usually associated, as a side effect, with other (social) environments and activities. Relying on real data from a commercially available platform, the aim of AFEL is to provide and validate the technological grounding and tools for exploiting learning analytics on such learning activities. This will be achieved in relation to cognitive models of learning and collaboration, which are necessary to the understanding of loosely defined learning processes in online social environments. Applying the skills available in the consortium to a concrete set of live, industrial online social environments, AFEL will tackle the main challenges of informal learning analytics through 1) developing the tools and techniques necessary to capture information about learning activities from (not necessarily educational) online social environments; 2) creating methods for the analysis of such informal learning data, based on combining feature engineering and visual analytics with cognitive models of learning and collaboration; and 3) demonstrating the potential of the approach in improving the understanding of informal learning, and the way it is better supported; 4) evaluate all the former items in real world large scale applications and platforms.","inCitations":["eb7cf6f336832df27100c48b0595d66c9d0b4671"],"pmid":"","title":"AFEL - Analytics for Everyday Learning.","journalPages":"439-440","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.dominikkowald.info/documents/2018www_afel.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3186206"],"entities":["Cognitive model","Collective intelligence","Educational data mining","Feature engineering","Personalization","Software analytics","Visual analytics"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["d804a3251ca025f9381690056b1c81e2fdffc628","fa350c2ce6e57c42c74f763f502a30ab4677924d","91e40035f76646fee44691a050bcfa8685813c16","2841e60dc43eb09f84f875024de059790bb84aff","ffee4306c7ba8271833fb8c57f51d5934dac2818"],"id":"ec895f753a37f2f4371de2d5d630fb52a76455c3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ec895f753a37f2f4371de2d5d630fb52a76455c3","authors":[{"name":"Mathieu d'Aquin","ids":["1714243"]},{"name":"Dominik Kowald","ids":["1803040"]},{"name":"Angela Fessl","ids":["1961914"]},{"name":"Elisabeth Lex","ids":["3124784"]},{"name":"Stefan Thalmann","ids":["2315075"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3186206"}

User\u2019s recent search history on each log has been widely studied individually as the context to benefit the modeling of users\u2019 behaviors on that log. However, there is no existing work that explores or incorporates both logs together for contextual data. As QAC and click logs actually record users\u2019 sequential behaviors while interacting with a search engine, the available context of a user\u2019s current behavior based on the same type of log can be strengthened from the user\u2019s recent search history shown on the other type of log. Our paper proposes to model users\u2019 behaviors on both QAC and click logs simultaneously by utilizing both logs as the contextual data of each other. The key idea is to capture the correlation between users\u2019 behavior patterns on both logs. We model such correlation through a novel probabilistic model based on the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. The learned users\u2019 behavior patterns on both logs are utilized to address not only the application of query auto-completion on QAC logs, but also the click prediction and relevance ranking of web documents on click logs. Experiments on real-world logs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on both applications.","inCitations":["08e9ee9d62c1c2f04c6fd1749f2a2211ded7daeb","0da353e79f666a3ae7dd0a5d28c75b852a7f60bf","cab5fbb2b1c245e1d99542e8ef54e4faf846e3da","84b499caf4681240eabaa54ec7337b9309921d29","a80a0ed4597d0dcb9f8d09009afbfa76e4ef621c"],"pmid":"","title":"Exploring Query Auto-Completion and Click Logs for Contextual-Aware Web Search and Query Suggestion","journalPages":"539-548","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fa98/90e7fca761f164ab8112e1699154d67bc635.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052593","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p539.pdf"],"entities":["Interaction","Latent Dirichlet allocation","Relevance","Statistical model","Web page","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2d4a55711b7c80468f64b13999a7cc1467357052","0020f7b5ff3bd39c322ae8f8f7927d116e77d322","2279b6c32509eeb47184c7fa468cae1e84da24eb","2a6a2aa21b266e463eaeca267440b8cadf2d85e0","000f5d8ec5338f7a2a8d85dfd5f9027fc09592b6","26e8f3cc46b710a013358bf0289df4de033446ba","113e43a8c01fbada598264262e45e780e6e4134e","be59652a90db393242dc95bcde049fc14cf8faad","4752e8858dd67002b16b281e115655307ec3c974","13d72ef522b405c18f7d228c5744687609b4c3a4","4b13c90bc1eba4ecc8b687bd2cc861f402c99b57","ce038f253b991beb777ba48c9ff5834e5dec81e3","eb69c0e29ab2c2187ea850ff23b9a66d222375ed","0bae016641fbd2d53d672435b51805e05a864edb","0ddc065cc92046857d35555c3af4ade1310aca4a","160ec59f2eb9def5cca00f6c1bf198d13fb8b6a7","0b811838fbd235d10e627c9d3ccca0df0a94c13d","505253630ab7e8f35e26e27904bd3c8faea3c5ce","f0951665942dcb80e795cfbe68b65d0dbda59b17","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","2df630cf3387fe3be404d9642c7fa3fb5ebb08f5","554c96209d77a540b2561cd2dee97bcf9a3e9e1a","2d533eb6ca5d47d745ed49c863ce3d8499b4bf17","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","6ff05febf5beeb158c654117496a324eb0a6c13e","10ceb668f84860bb09fca364125cae4b1ee2e760","681387f73200127cce575ebab182f093b63c273b","817f3394cb9379e91692a1a87cb199bd51d804b9","04c38643946c9acbb7f2b213e453aa14d17611e4","6ac8f27ecdc78e86eef15cf6afd43ddb9b6a20f6","27ae5272e7d4c260b1af931c225b5b92cbc7e26d","8c2498d8ad7aae2d03c32b0c3e5f67131b8dc3ff"],"id":"fa9890e7fca761f164ab8112e1699154d67bc635","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fa9890e7fca761f164ab8112e1699154d67bc635","authors":[{"name":"Liangda Li","ids":["33940122"]},{"name":"Hongbo Deng","ids":["2642895"]},{"name":"Anlei Dong","ids":["3300216"]},{"name":"Yi Chang","ids":["1787097"]},{"name":"Ricardo A.

It is a significant role in promoting the user experience and information propagation. To help users easily find the usernames they want to mention, the mention recommendation task has received considerable attention in recent years. Previous methods only incorporated textual information when performing this task. However, many users not only post texts on social media but also the corresponding images. These images can provide additional information that is not included in the text, which could be helpful in improving the accuracy of a mention recommendation. To make full use of textual and visual information, we propose a novel cross-attention memory network to perform the mention recommendation task for multimodal tweets.

We argue that the context of these matching signals is also important. Intuitively, when extracting, modeling, and combining matching signals, one would like to consider the surrounding text(local context) as well as other signals from the same document that can contribute to the overall relevance score. In this work, we highlight three potential shortcomings caused by not considering context information and propose three neural ingredients to address them: a disambiguation component, cascade k-max pooling, and a shuffling combination layer. Incorporating these components into the PACRR model yields Co-PACER, a novel context-aware neural IR model. Extensive comparisons with established models on TREC Web Track data confirm that the proposed model can achieve superior search results. In addition, an ablation analysis is conducted to gain insights into the impact of and interactions between different components. We release our code to enable future comparisons.","inCitations":["1b7d62c840024b4901cb1743a4c1bc2063ee88cc","542605231f980a0da5998f878796ac5e5f8f0fa9","4b69fbc425daf8f60f4dce42696b9b6d08d6c64f","e8a7d7b0230f162439dd04a19ba873238851a104","5091ee7158e105a7882eeb5f295d29e6cf1d77ec","dd0c8d73b23452f9492d45413b0455a2c5121d1b","314f03bf98f7ebd6376aa888336a7905b7046f8c"],"pmid":"","title":"Co-PACRR: A Context-Aware Neural IR Model for Ad-hoc Retrieval","journalPages":"279-287","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kberberi/publications/2018-wsdm2018.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10192v3.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3159689","http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~weblt/papers/neuralir-copacrr.pdf"],"entities":["Convolutional neural network","Experiment","Hoc (programming language)","Interaction","Learning to rank","PageRank","Relevance","Word-sense disambiguation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["260bc0544a9fb3db4aa2412ef7339cdc0008b82c","8d182d01a7f75766256f08d60755026557e6d691","3eae360c6ee52950f27f577aedd5f9934a04e137","8478c0f46dd30ef7f4052145983d6d315c2e1f17","4736c3d6f33569e2a3fef2b6617d4b7ae782ce94","53c6eab0dc9ac28d81b1a7a791df29a6493d792e","13d72ef522b405c18f7d228c5744687609b4c3a4","0496b636c5304ccd37321b5e04c13aadb9a5fbc0","234dc7984668f72ee4917755915040386be4eb1f","80a974f4797ce9f1d1280630d74eeab6d7475518","02121b35aa2c543e6afbd193afb9c929705b7aee","738d19f828d0fb35a05c45c40b7556ec271ab265","07f3f736d90125cb2b04e7408782af411c67dd5a","6fb1955992c1ef5147d07916bf0affaf0139f32a","ea738439b880ad033ff01602ea52d04b366d0d37","56d03ab8afe62e40c34cfb79607efa1ffac1988c","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","1b50c8353d9e4a241a5f4a9c0088eb9c5f593e1f","f42f3a1912f588329c181dab13dc9319d1aab01c","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383"],"id":"ad5d07e542a773820128c4da08ca4be18133cb92","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ad5d07e542a773820128c4da08ca4be18133cb92","authors":[{"name":"Kai Hui","ids":["47214884"]},{"name":"Andrew Yates","ids":["5269923"]},{"name":"Klaus Berberich","ids":["1806397"]},{"name":"Gerard de Melo","ids":["1732213"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159689"}

However, these queries are often ambiguous. For example, it is more likely (and easier) for users to write a query like \u201chigh-end bike\u201d than \u201c21 speed carbon frames jamis or giant road bike\u201d. It is challenging to interpret these ambiguous queries and thus search result accuracy suffers. A user oftentimes needs to go through the frustrating process of refining search queries or self-teaching from possibly unstructured information. However, shopping is indeed a structured domain, that is composed of category hierarchy, brands, product lines, features, etc. It would be much better if a shopping site could understand users\u2019 intent through this structure, present organized information, and then find the items with the right categories, brands or features. In this paper we study the problem of inferring the latent intent from unstructured queries and mapping them to structured attributes. We present a novel framework that jointly learns this knowledge from user consumption behaviors and product metadata. We present a hybrid Long Shortterm Memory (LSTM) [10] joint model that is accurate and robust, even though user queries are noisy and product catalog is rapidly growing. Our study is conducted on a largescale dataset from Google Shopping, that is composed of millions of items and user queries along with their click responses. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed model is more accurate, concise, and robust than multiple possible alternatives. In terms of information retrieval (IR) performance, our model is able to improve the quality of current Google Shopping production system, which is a very strong baseline.","inCitations":["a08ae707035754d119e4024e69fad5bba18c4b51"],"pmid":"","title":"Predicting Latent Structured Intents from Shopping Queries","journalPages":"1133-1141","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3bb9/4c9f6876d66e76fd0f43a5d3177fd6418904.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~cywu/www2017_shopping_query.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1133.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052704"],"entities":["Ambiguous grammar","Baseline (configuration management)","Google Shopping","Information retrieval","Long short-term memory","Online shopping","Production system (computer science)","Web search query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6beb7a83c762f1f6796e602f71191ceef95027ff","108961c7366e36825ffed94ac9eab603e05b6bc6","192430f504627585e63c463d29d97d4ebc046ba5","121a954123a08e0165246290b609262f1581b81f","690c60a26c50ee27ac6057d578db9a6ba8b72b84","4824837f551235398dd8300984cb29629aaa3c90","157099d6ffd3ffca8cfca7955aff7c5f1a979ac9","1967ad3ac8a598adc6929e9e6b9682734f789427","2be0d0ce3f5729661e19774f4ec9eed8932aab2f","607a834558b16c318be9c735bea048ae6638841d","0891ed6ed64fb461bc03557b28c686f87d880c9a","477a1ef18cf51686786c9ea223ff26a2dc364f91","dea266419175e64b5b543bd3b9ef11b52243f4c8","48e8e8085907192d501eb2bcc582035e90431a2f","e3c1bf806c325f306e5084c3bd332b83d2077e2a","ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649","48a12a320ec4751096e9bb298bf16b4dfb29a8bf","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","0caf7892917a53011e062c9f9057551a601b6695","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","112a929962c1d95883730bfa3fcc7fe856cd21ab","a8b5866e2a717bfc4186b7a93bddcf460957e6bd","64b54bdf023624da4f261cdd18ac57716658e81f","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","4b8089bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2","6853ac3b9a4d5fe940356e44e3cb99d84490a484","652d159bf64a70194127722d19841daa99a69b64","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e","896b9c1551b7ffa347baed144582ec3b5d88f703"],"id":"3bb94c9f6876d66e76fd0f43a5d3177fd6418904","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3bb94c9f6876d66e76fd0f43a5d3177fd6418904","authors":[{"name":"Chao-Yuan Wu","ids":["2978413"]},{"name":"Amr Ahmed","ids":["2147739"]},{"name":"Gowtham Ramani Kumar","ids":["1777629"]},{"name":"Ritendra Datta","ids":["40490812"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052704"}

In this paper we explore how to solve the correlation clustering objective exactly when the data to be clustered can be represented by a low-rank matrix. We prove in particular that correlation clustering can be solved in polynomial time when the underlying matrix is positive semidefinite with small constant rank, but that the task remains NP-hard in the presence of even one negative eigenvalue. Based on our theoretical results, we develop an algorithm for efficiently \u201csolving\u201d low-rank positive semidefinite correlation clustering by employing a procedure for zonotope vertex enumeration. We demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of our algorithm by using it to solve several clustering problems on both synthetic and real-world data.","inCitations":["af58baa0e9fcb54f7a10299b5dfdba7e7638296d"],"pmid":"","title":"Correlation Clustering with Low-Rank Matrices","journalPages":"1025-1034","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3d71/830cc6a59370785e9466101a569ce3282e5e.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07305v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07305","https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/publications/Veldt%202017%20-%20Low-rank%20CC.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1025.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052586","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07305v1.pdf"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Closing (morphology)","Cluster analysis","Computer science","Correlation clustering","Iteration","Low-rank approximation","Mathematical optimization","Multitier architecture","NP-hardness","Optimization problem","Polynomial","Synthetic intelligence","Time complexity","Time series","Vertex enumeration problem","Web search query","Zonohedron"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5c55a8e2c3d22cadd04e5c033e5540878cc8fe9c","a4e11c750e5b448b82f3f90d5bf44ee58749f85c","871c57af42c76b133266d956bba65a44b2a503d5","365fb18262a34f362d82cadb8c5d1eb739b312a5","cbb786e7e42d02de0080299dc2e114357e816002","0250b5c0f7a414dec8c7a0aa7be20c9637eeb6ec","2440a3bce01e9a91f255d2d03447e5c1c53574da","02aca19d1cd7937baca730319d2bfe95b8e6507a","3f4c358fd88f0fee9cc7a7e4ae15a45ddc268aa5","1f6f8f3e4e44c8723d9b5955c4db8b6d4c7374de","25608ed40a0f5c4ea12715f8043d003693c82315","4acf3d6214523c09dfec0dd160540125ab30c492","3bb17eb64b3d5db3dea2b43e903159122f678747","1920e6c133a90802833b3e68094c27cebd07e2ff","91f9e0ca788339824491ab22d48aa0e2c5087825","171992814ff1640580fea9a8788b2471e0c0ed92","95f50431a8d418a52a7b2e488ec50e29bcdd5521","1a5c50cff736ab5340a5d8c6c57685423e30de03","28992e3ae9d81939125e87d7197f7d15abdae2ce","13124216a53b6b3469cd477ad43b00e302bd90db","5b8bf15b7202c2ffaac2e15227d3e73290f15376","2c9ea987d71975f9e5f7cb58c3ba9476514c271e","1e3b61f29e5317ef59d367e1a53ba407912d240e","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","61d7405a3b5e3b0f843f37efc69f383178a6075b","96b8bf94ce88754458e8d23fd24782e72871d93b","1c059493904b2244d2280b8b4c0c7d3ca115be73"],"id":"3d71830cc6a59370785e9466101a569ce3282e5e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d71830cc6a59370785e9466101a569ce3282e5e","authors":[{"name":"Nate Veldt","ids":["3407218"]},{"name":"Anthony Wirth","ids":["40009100"]},{"name":"David F.

User-specific information has a fundamental impact on personal music preferences and interests. However, existing research pays little attention to the modeling and integration of user-specific information in music retrieval algorithms/models to facilitate music search. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named User-Information-Aware Music Interest Topic (UIA-MIT) model. The model is able to effectively capture the influence of user-specific information on music preferences, and further associate users' music preferences and search terms under the same latent space. Based on this model, a user information aware retrieval system is developed, which can search and re-rank the results based on age- and/or gender-specific music preferences. A comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that our methods can significantly improve the search accuracy over existing text-based music retrieval methods.","inCitations":["5ab8a10bfd197d2de2ec0446d9d615b1a962620f","262a5a784eedb127490f44736844a33123b30fe0","11e5a445219640a0378ac74fdc9f76e3174a9663","d3e231f88b82e402e7a7e29a03176b3ea5c3c546"],"pmid":"","title":"Exploring User-Specific Information in Music Retrieval","journalPages":"655-664","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080772","http://www.nextcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Exploring-User-Specific-Information-in-Music-Retrieval.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cloud computing","Experiment","Mobile computing","Streaming media","Text-based (computing)","User-centered design"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1960c7d4365c1165283fc2304be7d09a853fb33d","6278c908f7086d75e4074ec1158b730ba8affd7d","86ececa5aca5bf43442a84723a2c4b88ceccecc9","a7ef69e55244e3fa0b065746d596441103b293a5","7584a5c32600fadcc943809b5e788719910a4547","0cd6c70ac57b796c12bd59229ea901a77ce8f066","83fe6bdf3bb32361d5812570ceed2a36d7bd5046","e0e1a359c0617be201d4e9ddfd021ed950dc0940","270c147c9b651a2e85e795675f80afed2c54c5fb","6683426ca06560523fc7461152d4dd3b84a07854","38351d2e2f09190cadb643fa8d3c3ae3963ec682","52227cd6e3b3ffe71d2445b3d95db33457215cde","b37062646040d5b46c871b09d634cd2374fc2536","5ca28c48f5e479c1f76e999b20b83f929952a966","7f43387718ffbc98396bd1914ede6fb3fdb6751f","2e74e2ddd93972e46cd0b669c41d3b356a38440b","0cb3e8e756e071d01dddfd2cd51d27846ab43684","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","5cbf53feb4dbf8282995f5a99355c82e6c18f21b","1187d5b34fda59fc1e65b281d37e6a03aa886043","7ca2ae03ac46053f5e7291fa37c0fd99ce4e9fb5","39b6331a3bbebeaed41b567b0050eee445670073","bbc4ac061faa3d63a16f613cfeba16c2f965d191","08c367ba58e67cd28f07976ca3529d5eeb591da1","ee9b266b519c2d851cc51b33c40609a4a84a79d3","438c0d86f451a4a853e741ef5876c2b197f0ca9f","8f9cb27ecdb52da08cbf6798edbcb91d2a818e5c","4008d78a584102086f2641bcb0dab51aff0d353b","0cf464e413e1e051b535d4d42de4ecd49853053e","90cd005a097750cdb020cafa0470ab3d41219afb","bc1f9209b134f149ab611dba116e52dbbb3e0900","39210c16f77f7018007dfa20dc7a7b615b73303b","3a8096d475468d939d36a2ad15c2044f6f21917b","61181e71ca1b899b5fdaaac24daac2463b3e6c96","ba8224e4597003553de4aa5d4905e6e52955108f","c71ac3664d437546ee2ffc9e7ed496a34e694c19","7830024953f765485582225cf8baf3e6765d8b34","4ee4fc69240ee6c062aeafbede9e96aa0a8596bf","17b67e902819b055d2f385519590fe8e2b2148f2","91878969e81c7e46ebee6229c380f25207de534a","4e9d2433b60f17c6fba15a144a0fbecf2ddb722a","491b57680a448ba646005e2357a6642015d0dae6","099d85f25e9336f48ff64287a4b53ee5fb64ab51","4c5ba940d010ba7fe338afc6765b61254c7f52b2"],"id":"26d0ed88edde3a265169b37b404cabb78f5b84b4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/26d0ed88edde3a265169b37b404cabb78f5b84b4","authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Cheng","ids":["13167100"]},{"name":"Jialie Shen","ids":["38203359"]},{"name":"Liqiang Nie","ids":["1743245"]},{"name":"Tat-Seng Chua","ids":["1684968"]},{"name":"Mohan S.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing automatic tools that can assess motor function in PD patients. Here we show that mouse tracking data collected during people's interaction with a search engine can be used to distinguish PD patients from similar, non-diseased users and present a methodology developed for the diagnosis of PD from these data. The main challenge we address is the extraction of informative features from raw mouse tracking data. We do so in two complementary ways: First, we manually construct expert-recommended features, aiming to identify abnormalities in motor behaviors. Second, we use an unsupervised representation learning technique to map these raw data to high-level features. Using all the extracted features, a Random Forest classifier is then used to distinguish PD patients from controls, achieving an AUC of 0.92, while results using only expert-generated or auto-generated features are 0.87 and 0.83, respectively. Our results indicate that mouse tracking data can help in detecting users at early stages of the disease and that both expert-generated features and unsupervised techniques for feature generation are required to achieve the best possible performance.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Detecting Parkinson's Disease from Interactions with a Search Engine: Is Expert Knowledge Sufficient?","journalPages":"1539-1542","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01138","http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01138","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01138v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269250"],"entities":["Feature learning","High- and low-level","Information","Interaction","Machine learning","Mouse tracking","Random forest","Sensor","Source-to-source compiler","Unsupervised learning","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["83dc2a2380c898d45c4485d2260f55c424f5a465","48ee247c2aceaa86c5a0e13a4331de96c3065485","e3b5b3b2352fd6e6e291741e340d0509197a9e94","664ec878de4b7170712baae4a7821fc2602bba25","3582071906cba213150fa09bc340a7c05e05ad96","87fc6c32e314e571581ab255a3e89ad7bc6fa211","137b58a48d7e0de27634bc37b4bc9c7ab9103885","a1041032f846cefbdc453141c151c53d997ebd41","7ef9f22727abc2c78d5d364995fa4ac75c666f9b","5a8a4a7e10b73ed08f35514b31bbca240d67bc78","6a5d9ed5b1fb35b8341900e3d474e1ea1e9850ae","7c7811f8fed3fb5330f7ecac8fc8029a5a0d73e6","c23e9c620bc7bdb940d5458d2b7e53d36b8e3e7a","4a8c26f9f6107d4f9d945f1383c37503567d40b7","1f03213016839b44b29687fc222db87ce70d8de4"],"id":"ddb200d1d3a48a41e07d6a0a5e20fb2e81b38cc1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ddb200d1d3a48a41e07d6a0a5e20fb2e81b38cc1","authors":[{"name":"Liron Allerhand","ids":["46257221"]},{"name":"Brit Youngmann","ids":["3455113"]},{"name":"Elad Yom-Tov","ids":["1749176"]},{"name":"David Arkadir","ids":["2852517"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3269250"}

Previous remarkable approaches mainly adopt general Compare-Aggregate framework that performs word-level comparison and aggregation. In this paper, unlike previous Compare-Aggregate models which utilize the traditional attention mechanism to generate corresponding word-level vector before comparison, we propose a novel attention mechanism named Dynamic-Clip Attention which is directly integrated into the Compare-Aggregate framework. Dynamic-Clip Attention focuses on filtering out noise in attention matrix, in order to better mine the semantic relevance of word-level vectors. At the same time, different from previous Compare-Aggregate works which treat answer selection task as a pointwise classification problem, we propose a listwise ranking approach to model this task to learn the relative order of candidate answers. Experiments on TrecQA and WikiQA datasets show that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance.","inCitations":["0d7ebce1386ba5821dcc65b8dd04df81b629f348","28ba84620f8a67faf239e5e4539745a847ec6284","629feacc0f099f72618e7df7f48ee44f99c46f38","84329a5ade32a3d98b03558c95c001c17e1740ae","c90851f7bf0c4a54073a4155642622965e6fdb93","b5388cfc06688fe3c6937c65025442fdf9a1e6b9","ca7dfe6d994ce56b94c51babbefc1814ac3a5b0b","79cce33b3a14456236b311e67d49031ef07cac33","6b77cbfa239f814a4401a23b118ad068c78845c5","dc64a09b1d58f65a6fc4784684a54bed6fe7857d","e235387131b35a2b507afadfcbe0c831b5faa15c"],"pmid":"","title":"A Compare-Aggregate Model with Dynamic-Clip Attention for Answer Selection","journalPages":"1987-1990","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133089"],"entities":["Aggregate function","Experiment","Google Questions and Answers","Question answering","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["07a9478e87a8304fc3267fa16e83e9f3bbd98b27","29990c3f2d38b052414886bae5f35cbac8224033","684be9e9bd41d148158c64ba811c08f66b58092a","03fe39386ce90e10ec87f10e00532c5cf30b244f","b9d220520a5da7d302107aacfe875b8e2977fdbe","68e4aedc69518d8db2f143bd3952668aa41c762c","596c882de006e4bb4a93f1fa08a5dd467bee060a","1261fe9bfde319abcc5d011bc70f7e7547b5258f","24b4746688c15c8580d1000d4f4ac63f5eb79561","100c730003033151c0f78ed1aab23df3e9bd5283","6f1b6007638724124e2763f818ee4ebf2da3ae86","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","0476b7d387d2a6381a784b2b89ccf7baef098f5e","e1969f3b5ae3e7d92f64cbcbe2a01a1d07e099c5","515a554d001a53ba58fe5f83c6fb73556b396191"],"id":"cfdaad9ac371b0c8928fe96ddff58a042531f916","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cfdaad9ac371b0c8928fe96ddff58a042531f916","authors":[{"name":"Weijie Bian","ids":["9455314"]},{"name":"Si Li","ids":["47319396"]},{"name":"Zhao Yang","ids":["2649412"]},{"name":"Guang Chen","ids":["1697099"]},{"name":"Zhiqing Lin","ids":["1869541"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133089"}

One example involves increasing usage of biomarkers when characterizing the pathologic prognostic stage of a breast tumor. We present our semantic technology approach to support cancer characterization and demonstrate it in our end-to-end prototype system that collects the newest breast cancer staging criteria from authoritative oncology manuals to construct an ontology for breast cancer. Using a tool we developed that utilizes this ontology, physician-facing applications can be used to quickly stage a new patient to support identifying risks, treatment options, and monitoring plans based on authoritative and best practice guidelines. Physicians can also re-stage existing patients or patient populations, allowing them to find patients whose stage has changed in a given patient cohort. As new guidelines emerge, using our proposed mechanism, which is grounded by semantic technologies for ingesting new data from staging manuals, we have created an enriched cancer staging ontology that integrates relevant data from several sources with very little human intervention.","inCitations":["40892c844ab0ba2deaddb8ce0933691153faf0fa"],"pmid":"","title":"Knowledge Integration for Disease Characterization: A Breast Cancer Example","journalPages":"223-238","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2863/e1f0f304e97a782bc25593421eac01a57157.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07991","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07991v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00668-6_14"],"entities":["Best practice","Disk staging","End-to-end principle","Knowledge integration","Population","Prototype"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["31c3e2e83b2e1e6a3a56e233d2a02f84921d71a2","adb01e065c4c9ea6ad8e65a75099fc8cbda8cb88","feadc67a41129b42b90169eaaab7e5d461e2563b","2c0cc7227ac10cf0dcbbc8e3a86903897bf6ffcb","a9302c75774ba7a62c542fce23c05994b8b95f27","172b47a768ee08129a62c799fa1308b27418585a","0a01736fafa562ccbecea935409be4a5b098951f","bbb2534e5a8d6e494bc74ea8993ac97aa1bf3333","8b3b758a2e9c4983263d0fd4f2cb555e69355be3","3a13ce71acdd1f28c9ffc17bd2db981aab0fada6","081302ba9760ae53f5f675a16263b72b9fe908da","c678e95fd57958761f061f7fc69927c909628e02","c53692ba562818cf8488bd03936eaac9de42d2bf","ec7cdedc2fa3e494c4cf65e4445a5cabbea24963","a01e23ee432b64a0ccc1e41bd6fc8009eb52da6f","7c32c3d460ab3b153a61ae997b000153ec85fa91","11c3d0a4e594c0a19615cec01f29ee50d8467306","492ca1d12b2b95aab728721be906efd4a3bae051","02df3d50dbd1d15c38db62ff58a5601ebf815d59","56563b8ce94db69bf0dff8243368792312c8b6cd","85f8a460ffad8cf32d76b1b2ec4f4a66818697bc","a2ac63a9e807a6d9f94ebf4e11a3adf2560a197c"],"id":"2863e1f0f304e97a782bc25593421eac01a57157","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2863e1f0f304e97a782bc25593421eac01a57157","authors":[{"name":"Oshani Seneviratne","ids":["1693195"]},{"name":"Sabbir M.

For decades, assessing the risk of drivers has relied on demographic information which allows the insurer to segment the market in several risk groups priced with an appropriate premium. In the recent years, however, some insurers started experimenting with so called Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) in which the insurer monitors a number of additional variables (mostly related to the location) and uses them to better assess the risk of the drivers. While several studies have reported results on the UBI trials these studies keep the studied data confidential (for obvious privacy and business concerns) which inevitably limits their reproducibility and interest by the data-mining community. In this paper we discuss a methodology for studying driver risk assessment using a public dataset of 173M taxi rides in NYC with over 40K drivers. Our approach for risk assessment utilizes not only the location data (which is significantly sparser than what is normally exploited in UBI) but also the revenue, tips and overall activity of the drivers (as proxies of their behavioral traits) and obtain risk scoring accuracy on par with the reported results on non-professional driver cohorts in spite of sparser location data and no demographic information about the drivers.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"How Safe is Your (Taxi) Driver?","journalPages":"2319-2322","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133068"],"entities":["Confidentiality","Data mining","Device driver","Experiment","Risk assessment"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["952e093cfc813d65d06b7af0249965abe8aafcac","6dfe78bf211c5b617300d82412fc5f5485a7542a","ad42c5a42642e75d1a02b48c6eb84bab87874a1b","034991e695ca12d98eb7aec6d4a5783f3bbf8c22","6b2d1187e010af0732c84f193630e6136ed046e4"],"id":"b962d372d6a299b646b0e1159c116447722d24d1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b962d372d6a299b646b0e1159c116447722d24d1","authors":[{"name":"Rade Stanojevic","ids":["2191495"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133068"}

Besides the traditional space-pruning techniques such as indexing, type-based optimizations that exploit integrity constraints defined on the types can be used to rewrite queries into more efficient ones. However, such optimizations are only applicable in strongly-typed data and query models which make it a challenge for semi-structured models such as RDF. Consequently, developing techniques for enabling type-based query optimizations will contribute new insight to improving the scalability of RDF processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of type-based query optimization for RDF graph pattern queries. The approach comprises of (i) a novel type system for RDF data induced from data and ontologies and (ii) a query optimization and evaluation framework for evaluating graph pattern queries using type-based optimizations. An implementation of this approach integrated into Apache Pig is presented and evaluated. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets show that our approach is up to 500X faster than existing approaches.","inCitations":["6eb7fc71e7ce17598b0e0cd0b83d22ffaf449f19","c0f9db301f9b9bad79022355e6f2f4f0eb666ce7","0672984e36d95f198590db057b235b5c4fd5e33a","93837c2539ff35ba1ebad52c3523a6d7f28812a5"],"pmid":"","title":"Type-based Semantic Optimization for Scalable RDF Graph Pattern Matching","journalPages":"785-793","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052655","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p785.pdf"],"entities":["Apache Pig","Benchmark (computing)","Data integrity","Dhrystone","Experiment","IBM Notes","Mathematical optimization","Ontology (information science)","Pattern matching","Query optimization","R-Type","Relevance","Resource Description Framework","Rewrite (programming)","Scalability","Semi-structured model","Semiconductor industry","Strong and weak typing","Turing completeness","Type system"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2ee495cdf71dbab740771c4f02176a6f48827467","741f4bd8a0d1d01ff4be38bbaba10fc9ea6412c6","1194f1de35fe030fa9edebffb8d836711cd4603d","4b992b91fd9063d6d664af2d6bc5aa1bb535a1fc","99862b9ff41a0a5ea67ae45d97e2b99fffad43ef","0443448b390dae224b9f9aa717d893032f4085fc","3989d3352de49d649d8dcb9d2ef9c8a993e9bc8e","81836d9086683ceab2af97428dffbab6004d4a6b","36e59e71a19fba9f61012e8653a9eee884eac93c","16bae0f9f6a2823b2a65f6296494eea41f5c9859","2a88a3cc678ae1229ce894070bb22bd0df5ac3ab","801fbfdd1307e623d5862e4465ab76573fc4670a","744eacc689e1be16de6ca1f386ea3088abacad49","8926229a38966176f4a795bf5be36698af8975f5","0ad2940981997e25ea9a9dc699457a8ff3cc8ddb","9ba137798b2f9714b35180e4e350bbb6bf0b21d3","52719b0ed970047fc257b05915d371ebb1cd7012","72118216235f3875078a3c8696e2abd4273bc3b8","8ba977aa60dd8ab6bae41510ad9fb4cf5a6fa939","da6d456d1731b814344019d8e43b1d51f11dba7a","43324e357ec8858c604242f98a67db52638180d1","0ec461b87c2b2725f67093d7cd2dc5aed044f4b8","c28327236c77db4e3440549a8f278d53e4622808","6112136a7239138ed5dfab826447303e578fb998","ae7b4d783f3fecb0acccd29906abf43adb6f77a7","4839898a196bd47910b6bc763b52e054128a27eb","55d8efeaedfdf6db48b6e98b46c2a62876959ce9"],"id":"09f16432559b712492e081592704f39758fda575","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/09f16432559b712492e081592704f39758fda575","authors":[{"name":"HyeongSik Kim","ids":["2958010"]},{"name":"Padmashree Ravindra","ids":["2774503"]},{"name":"Kemafor Anyanwu","ids":["1846932"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052655"}

In particular, we regard each user as a training instance, and heuristically choose a subset of accurate and diverse items as groundtruth for each user. We then represent each user or item as a vector resulted from the factorization of the user-item rating matrix. In our paper, we try to discover a factorization for matching the following supervised learning task. In doing this, we define two coupled optimization problems, parameterized matrix factorization and structural learning, to formulate our task. And we propose a diversified collaborative filtering algorithm (DCF) to solve the coupled problems. We also introduce a new pairwise accuracy metric and a normalized topic coverage diversity metric to measure the performance of accuracy and diversity respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the performance gains of DCF in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.","inCitations":["0477823fd5536e11e37638a46d4212de145eb3da","7c126e8f0115d8a7f5b53d526cdd2ca2c4feb198","aa39e845a8dc4af95d16f93f3cd904a91f4564a4","11b0993e09d767818ea9cd40f18439fed9fa10e9","b764d0070d07957d4b9621988ea3d020e9ecbe36","aee9357d655c5854e9a1efecfa960735a12f98f1","66dd92ea7281b696221bf044a999649a6732cd01"],"pmid":"","title":"Learning to Recommend Accurate and Diverse Items","journalPages":"183-192","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cbfc/dad2b0c58443113acf80b1830e60164b8016.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p183.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052585"],"entities":["Algorithm","Benchmark (computing)","Collaborative filtering","Design rule for Camera File system","Experiment","Heuristic","Mathematical optimization","Supervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["22bf66441dd0fb73e4d8563ddd56c962bfd38735","23bbea130398331084021cc895a132064219b4b1","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","75cca03b03dc514f03c102ccfdd53a7c0af625fc","e84e9f82f49eb5a21cdf2306e42478773ff9e82a","e3a9b5b2a24307b133578424a636a486a7b1e37f","e84823aba38797f8b6c3cff9e677c4b85296a57e","29671a0b2e8ed39f11d3535340ad59089cd40757","42edd85b1618ccec9577ae286ce2521c62b75a53","a83cb80dd4ed5160c66dbd31c7782b01e7a97170","20aa9c0c17ce85ff2eeac313f02e835e14e7c593","1a932850aa9b155bffef3c52e6b51633cf2f1956","100e6ac4215956869103850dcb078eed638d366f","a72f412d336d69a82424cb7d610bb1bb9d81ef7c","040a872a47ea76127111a1262c8e8685736951e3","87765820abd62577444dc498a15f30e306ea4403","64edd2c5c41e856695e1dcb950c0512c3a87edec","3cd71c991b418d47680e7c5894ef5b1e793f0627","15004aadabd967ac722a28a9c3bb39cf5bc32605","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701","8490234d79b47e459824dcf87c1e288211a3c964","333e3e7d801abc8ba6500ebee28ec3d4e7a19842","098c57f75479813c2cdc848ab16ef41d87353702","12d10a13c9ee6e0c8e7478593608880d1a558060","95ed9e883b6321658b95a8db28d0704e90973a9d","e0cf9c51192f63c3a9e3b23aa07ee5654fc97b68","28592229e9e3fe69d18c260b279c2309d1276863","2ba6c04eaef488d5a6d8bb2ff3d19c44facbf1b4","06fd8b6fccf2b71e0e7b69b2bb2b78910e2110ac","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","93ab05bea8836de13c602374c9ba2d41256ad273","900874be4d48f919434a3107d959e57a55bc286c"],"id":"cbfcdad2b0c58443113acf80b1830e60164b8016","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cbfcdad2b0c58443113acf80b1830e60164b8016","authors":[{"name":"Peizhe Cheng","ids":["2423508"]},{"name":"Shuaiqiang Wang","ids":["2386396"]},{"name":"Jun Ma","ids":["35729719"]},{"name":"Jiankai Sun","ids":["2282025"]},{"name":"Hui Xiong","ids":["1707713"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052585"}

In this paper we study a destination-aware task assignment problem that concerns the optimal strategy of assigning each task to proper worker such that the total number of completed tasks can be maximized whilst all workers can reach their destinations before deadlines after performing assigned tasks. Finding the global optimal assignment turns out to be an intractable problem since it does not imply optimal assignment for individual worker. Observing that the task assignment dependency only exists amongst subsets of workers, we utilize tree-decomposition technique to separate workers into independent clusters and develop an efficient depth-first search algorithm with progressive bounds to prune non-promising assignments. Our empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed technique is quite effective and settle the problem nicely.","inCitations":["063a429549772e676c4627a90835648a2e447872","6026f60b995ae6f39bdb12fd53026b967e3e823f","bf0e18f8dd01fec4ef428e08415086c07e01d869","c1081f8de21a26ca0a67aa4e0f7b00deeee36796"],"pmid":"","title":"Destination-aware Task Assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing","journalPages":"297-306","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132894"],"entities":["Activity selection problem","Assignment problem","Computational complexity theory","Crowdsourcing","Data-intensive computing","Depth-first search","Global Positioning System","Mobile device","Real-time clock","Search algorithm","Sensor","Smart device","Tree decomposition","Tree structure","While"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3479f06bf75751f0df4c7256a29a37e2499b1453","9382290d20878c83853d27c11da642bcc95f812f","c5e5425e768bc87dbe6e65513be4b7bab716db9c","af1df4d69ea2bc6c37839aee65da0d3159ae0446","1ffc977d82798cfab971e4abdb46ae7b707c57c0","a44b2fbd07d6d17e968afc240ac212f9070b95c3","3867a4840beba5adddf59c48fb8eaffdf258a2f7","28b1eb01c96cd8612dc34ae99993c3b0461ef7e8","7a365011424e2805661f2ecfbd8f25712f1cfd6c","0bf203c1b88af5afb25a2ded34132ad78b402882","2feff877dcf4b4014d91914dde04b33a0a23349e","5dc5e005a440fa275dc5ca7f26a548e08690304f","69cdb29f40ed71442265032cee5dc5a159b534d0","0358521d1270ebd4877ee5b812364376a0437634","28db1c5517fbe6fc41f4739025dd86c28d0c72e5","01719e72736d38944859785cc1c5f7510d40d602","46a90058bd1ebbc2314eec958bee1e1ae38f8ca8","102d18f91766c33a5d5cdefe4c8a0ef0859532ca","373ddd5932cb69a7edcec2732e6d40b20e2ebc03","02dd5c4a264b32d7e667cfa9ec55b591493807b9","31cf8b23a3f1c53ce85e86ea1905c539eb2e7376","8dc1d54ad3c02c2e88f4deac04d1ebc3d73b330f","69e855ef0f0f77cc4d71a60c047305e40bc29e22"],"id":"aab192e2e0340593231f1a47e5eab497dee107be","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aab192e2e0340593231f1a47e5eab497dee107be","authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhao","ids":["1725912"]},{"name":"Yang Li","ids":["1678662"]},{"name":"Yu Wang","ids":["47904166"]},{"name":"Han Su","ids":["2518568"]},{"name":"Kai Zheng","ids":["38671700"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132894"}

They are expecting search engines to answer questions, to be more conversational, and to offer means to complete tasks on their behalf. At the same time, to increase the breadth of tasks that personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as Microsoft»s Cortana or Amazon»s Alexa, are capable of, PDAs need to better utilize information about the world, a significant amount of which is available in the knowledge bases and answers built for search engines. It thus seems likely that the underlying systems that power web search and PDAs will converge. This demonstration presents a system that merges elements of traditional multi-turn dialog systems with web based question answering. This demo focuses on the automatic composition of semantic functional units, Botlets, to generate responses to user»s natural language (NL) queries.

Among existing models, non-negative-matrix factorization (NMF) approaches have proven effective for this task. However, NMF approaches, like other models in this context, exhibit a major drawback, namely they use the bag-of-word representation and, thus, do not account for the sequential order in which words occur in documents. This is an important issue since it may result in a significant loss of semantics. In this paper, we aim to address the above issue and propose a new model which successfully integrates a word embedding model, word2vec, into an NMF framework so as to leverage the semantic relationships between words. Empirical results, on several real-world datasets, demonstrate the benefits of our model in terms of text document clustering as well as document/word embedding.","inCitations":["e020363f6077bee49f90bd3addbab7c5e4eacb8a","f17ac8cc25be3676ade8a08387c58c0795ebc1e6","2792cf5cb3124059defeb07e751c00a27ca5ea82"],"pmid":"","title":"Non-negative Matrix Factorization Meets Word Embedding","journalPages":"1081-1084","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080727"],"entities":["Cluster analysis","Distributional semantics","Experiment","Information retrieval","Matrix regularization","Non-negative matrix factorization","Semantic data model","Text corpus","Wikipedia","Word embedding","Word2vec"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5b72dd4e799c58566dda782689ae3d9574efeea4","3ed9b9e2972e429cbba3d9f8a5edff2f4f8619fe","1e1d1c9a3cc9991bf64b075be899bff7440f895a","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","2e37d6b9a02ec31ea22252c37beae410c6b609a8","241e2b442812d843dbd30e924c2f2f6ad8e12179","12e46e8bebeb36875d19bc6d61cde3531bb39ca5","96544d4857777682129280b9d934d6ff2f221f40","82d5b206c77cd5f870d7def395f64bb15974fb3c","b9d8d7a395fc6b364113c20c979bcfcc48642e37","774dd71f42cca20aa0eaf93fc337ab48fb123fd1","0826c98d1b1513aa2f45e6654bb5075a58b64649","dd43dc772b81f14e1c0acd2e734500940376d6c4"],"id":"e6a02689604ff8606bc7ee82689b4e6fac16b999","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e6a02689604ff8606bc7ee82689b4e6fac16b999","authors":[{"name":"Melissa Ailem","ids":["3097148"]},{"name":"Aghiles Salah","ids":["2911888"]},{"name":"Mohamed Nadif","ids":["1744699"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080727"}

{"doiUrl":"","venue":"LDOW@WWW","journalName":"CoRR","sources":["DBLP"],"year":2018,"paperAbstract":"Relational data sources are still one of the most popular ways to store enterprise or Web data, however, the issue with relational schema is the lack of a well-defined semantic description. A common ontology provides a way to represent the meaning of a relational schema and can facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data sources within a domain. Semantic labeling is achieved by mapping attributes from the data sources to the classes and properties in the ontology. We formulate this problem as a multi-class classification problem where previously labeled data sources are used to learn rules for labeling new data sources. The majority of existing approaches for semantic labeling have focused on data integration challenges such as naming conflicts and semantic heterogeneity. In addition, machine learning approaches typically have issues around class imbalance, lack of labeled instances and relative importance of attributes. To address these issues, we develop a new machine learning model with engineered features as well as two deep learning models which do not require extensive feature engineering. We evaluate our new approaches with the state-of-the-art.","inCitations":["36b5caf0cd57bd38b710ee0d1753c8953aa526ec"],"pmid":"","title":"Evaluating Approaches for Supervised Semantic Labeling","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/303e/dd8c613cf4bbaa8853473ea9ee84142abb22.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09788v1.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2073/article-04.pdf","http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2018/papers/LDOW2018_paper_6.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09788"],"entities":["Database schema","Deep learning","Feature engineering","Machine learning","Multiclass classification","Semantic heterogeneity"],"journalVolume":"abs/1801.09788","outCitations":["1caf40f7e85a6f0e0a6d13939aa3e76ce71419b5","32163f8f5114beea5576c93b2ce21ec1e48988ce","aee598bc03a158ecbefc22e391e058220004fe20","5982babd2c39cd0013c98801a76e3b8cbbf6fec2","6196e723d435066c32d0f1e6afcfa0bf380cddc8","d1ee87290fa827f1217b8fa2bccb3485da1a300e","4954fa180728932959997a4768411ff9136aac81","58dfe569db2fc2e632869ef58e5d4c4ee66d7fad","011ffa226a58b6711ce509609b8336911325b0e0","13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986","b28295a35d4fb075557dc3c41375fb7416c1eebb","c44cef69334cb62e6f6c7d0d245e1934f599815f","0c856b6d26208313b83d2757712fb73005381286","030f6132f6b6b3336ce9b0b29c5ac4c1e368b7dc","f8e4aa31665bded0e297c0442855787e243a7f95","5029918d406db6c4e008d5194891e3561c5734a7","2e61fc82bcbdeaa0f8778d51c166e904c04ed34e","45b830bac3764a3c941f7b2bec905663ac9f24f0","abc48c7515cb8fa7b69a79daa4d5837943396c88","15cf63f8d44179423b4100531db4bb84245aa6f1"],"id":"184cf9d09836ee801e043360d072124cae54fff9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/184cf9d09836ee801e043360d072124cae54fff9","authors":[{"name":"Nataliia Rümmele","ids":["1754340"]},{"name":"Yuriy Tyshetskiy","ids":["35352351"]},{"name":"Alex Collins","ids":["33640981"]}],"doi":""}

However, most of the k-means variants tend to compute distance of each data point to each cluster centroid for every iteration. We propose a fast heuristic to overcome this bottleneck with only marginal increase in MSE. We observe that across all iterations of K-means, a data point changes its membership only among a small subset of clusters. Our heuristic predicts such clusters for each data point by looking at nearby clusters after the first iteration of k-means. We augment well known variants of k-means with our heuristic to demonstrate effectiveness of our heuristic. For various synthetic and real-world datasets, our heuristic achieves speed-up of up-to 3 times when compared to efficient variants of k-means.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Faster K-Means Cluster Estimation","journalPages":"520-526","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/eb9e/381a91277de9187238137360105e3955fed4.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.04600v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04600","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_43","http://www2.cse.iitk.ac.in/~iwml/2016/papers/iWML_2016_paper_18.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Cluster analysis","Computation","Computer cluster","Converge","Data point","Experiment","Heuristic","Iteration","K-means clustering","Marginal model","Mean squared error","Six degrees of separation","Synthetic intelligence"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2ad064e72abb2cdd97178817aa21a0ff2909f014","343271490746e3dbcc4f951195365aace5298022","385dcc1480e341435b1aa7b7a523b4c7d9563b95","82004e099c336411354a5b4cbfe7a225dac4fe58","28992e3ae9d81939125e87d7197f7d15abdae2ce","a114adf98d48bbaf5c26b496803f448d85e87ff0","9241ea3d8cb85633d314ecb74b31567b8e73f6af"],"id":"eb9e381a91277de9187238137360105e3955fed4","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eb9e381a91277de9187238137360105e3955fed4","authors":[{"name":"Siddhesh Khandelwal","ids":["8804979"]},{"name":"Amit Awekar","ids":["1702207"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_43"}

We introduce the study of finding an incentive-compatible (strategy-proof) mechanism for selecting an influential vertex in a directed graph (e.g. Twitter\u2019s network). The goal is to devise a mechanism with a bounded ratio between the maximal influence and the influence of the selected user, and in which no user can improve its probability of being selected by following or unfollowing other users. We introduce the Two Path mechanism which is based on the idea of selecting the vertex that is the first intersection of two independent random walks in the network. The Two Path mechanism is incentive compatible on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and has a finite approximation ratio on natural subfamilies of DAGs. Simulations indicate that this mechanism is suitable for practical uses.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Incentive-Compatible Diffusion","journalPages":"1379-1388","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f092/40d5a2116797ae933932f4a20272d1269db9.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08013","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08013","https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186043","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08013v1.pdf"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ec659aca3aabeeaf404a30982ef55489bad8aa5e","353e424b6b6fdb489538dd5b31757945b9bd09a8","16e2a69ec94d08ceee3edbee304d16ac748979e2","27d4d898d95dfb84a9d420a7f5dd2cba8763b2e1","49b0c4b77bc8dfa19bb5a6ab7cd5cae941c0b2ec","1562d6e590aac6e754ce750190ef17060c4a1e93","1c4311c11f4d1cc735227f879101172f6a7adcbf","dcf64e0559a06231a75b30129b3f0fdfe3bf1cf8","07c89057c9bbe668083cf37a35a7852578025a30","b790f9ae49cdee5354eacfc7897ab9752acd5e2a","2cf3c50d49a646042dc299fc48982274139aeb20","2628a4ab8be64bdc71d6cf9d537586d28053db86","16a7e7ea236951a1034dd961a60f037800bde145","0a5b4ca64948fc1ecf34353f35f5cdc4146a1592","f9e70c7bb6913934e882aab01eca773ee05ce524","17356d327c5040417ce9ac8e993ca026961c17f2","9ac34c7040d08a27e7dc75cfa46eb0144de3a284","0f24a61e95b83d4a56f9b5f71a5cf13d0f6b5c55","92bf3eba68990f09bf20e6198a7716eb70e5bcff","23d49c3b7b5da9b40bd607f49f037c7491b4e04d"],"id":"f09240d5a2116797ae933932f4a20272d1269db9","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f09240d5a2116797ae933932f4a20272d1269db9","authors":[{"name":"Yakov Babichenko","ids":["2830102"]},{"name":"Oren Dean","ids":["36744812"]},{"name":"Moshe Tennenholtz","ids":["1708847"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186043"}

Quantification can in principle be solved by classifying all the unlabelled items and counting how many of them have been attributed to each class. However, this \"classify and count\" approach has been shown to yield suboptimal quantification accuracy; this has established quantification as a task of its own, and given rise to a number of methods specifically devised for it. We propose a recurrent neural network architecture for quantification (that we call QuaNet) that observes the classification predictions to learn higher-order \"quantification embeddings\", which are then refined by incorporating quantification predictions of simple classify-and-count-like methods.

Especially in the (bio)medical domain several sources like SNOMED, NCI, FMA, and more are distributed in the form of OWL ontologies. These can be matched and integrated in order to create one large medical Knowledge Base. However, an important issue is that the structure of these ontologies may be profoundly different hence using the mappings as initially computed can lead to incoherences or changes in their original structure which may affect applications. In this paper we present a framework and novel approach for integrating independently developed ontologies. Starting from an initial seed ontology which may already be in use by an application, new sources are used to iteratively enrich and extend the seed one. To deal with structural incompatibilities we present a novel fine-grained approach which is based on mapping repair and alignment conservativity, formalise it and provide an exact as well as approximate but practical algorithms. Our framework has already been used to integrate a number of medical ontologies and support real-world healthcare services provided by Babylon Health. Finally, we also perform an experimental evaluation and compare with state-of-the-art ontology integration systems that take into account the structure and coherency of the integrated ontologies obtaining encouraging results.","inCitations":["aeca48ca523129c38f16ac3336e8fccbd1cd011b","7cedd43e5a1b6eba695f804d472e88b5f9d01724","118c386da06a9ce552b3893aeb69d23f8ae27584"],"pmid":"","title":"A Novel Approach and Practical Algorithms for Ontology Integration","journalPages":"458-476","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f81/aa310f688ac066fcff035beca21f1a917d55.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://www.dit.unitn.it/~pavel/OM/articles/Stoilos_iswc18.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_27"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Babylon","FMA instruction set","Knowledge base","NC (complexity)","Ontology (information science)","Semantic Web","Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine","Web Ontology Language","Web standards"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["203cd77a53d2ca88d191bce24fa1c22c1ba80e1a","b1b2a1db535e90b9b192c92b55a5e9e0375f2f0f","439f4ef90197d7b74147d3ae754a0053ecd9da0b","fe6c11b5f5a0d1a4296bf180f1d906237b7669c3","6a6eecd03beb9e6abfcbb99b1f1d0101477fc996","0a01736fafa562ccbecea935409be4a5b098951f","95466f00a92beb717388a713d445757135038e21","a6457a1c93e24ed38b9c7190943e65fad78a1b6b","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","937c576f7b39a53908d8c646983ddd2bda94a321","3a13ce71acdd1f28c9ffc17bd2db981aab0fada6","dca5bd58b2e50c4fba6c48d0a81b1a1c3f9eedad","0b723c10befd943044f1af4f9fd1c0947e858b7f","2c12373fa6412e48b328fd97e440c0a27b98fb18","5afe9bfb9db7d041ef9631f76c1aec213a548987","2644e55aaccf6705f1fb79391cba92714421ae6d","00ee57a4f393e672ad793caff0917330a722afd3","bf9f77900d80a4e8aa8bc6f2c9b2ea604db2b4b6","8752adda33df445a11579c418c5da701606c499f","39f4757209ae338af430648d1a178068c22097db","f98ea07685cf2312db3c5321de1cc885af4748d9","f9fa997ec37c1feb77c499561630f573a66c3f63"],"id":"7f81aa310f688ac066fcff035beca21f1a917d55","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7f81aa310f688ac066fcff035beca21f1a917d55","authors":[{"name":"Giorgos Stoilos","ids":["2174835"]},{"name":"David Geleta","ids":["3203800"]},{"name":"Jetendr Shamdasani","ids":["1746962"]},{"name":"Mohammad Khodadadi","ids":["2895080"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_27"}

Crowdedness on trains leads to a deterioration in the quality of service and has a negative impact on the well-being of the passenger. In order to stimulate travelers to consider less crowded trains, the iRail project wants to show an occupancy indicator in their route planning applications by the means of predictive modeling. As there is no official occupancy data available, training data is obtained by crowd-sourcing using the iRail web app and the mobile Railer application for iPhone. Users can indicate their departure & arrival station, at what time they took a train and classify the occupancy of that train into the classes: low, medium or high. While preliminary results on a limited dataset conclude that the models do not yet perform sufficiently well, we are convinced that with further research and a larger amount of data, our predictive model will be able to achieve higher predictive performances. All datasets used in the current research are, for that purpose, made publicly available under an open license on the iRail website and in the form of a Kaggle competition. Moreover, an infrastructure is set up that automatically processes new logs submitted by users in order for our model to continuously learn. Occupancy predictions for future trains are made available through an api. ∗(Produces the permission block, and copyright information). For use with SIG-ALTERNATE.CLS.

The literature presents several approaches to identifying the emergence of new research topics, which rely on the assumption that the topic is already exhibiting a certain degree of popularity and consistently referred to by a community of researchers. However, detecting the emergence of a new research area at an embryonic stage, i.e., before the topic has been consistently labelled by a community of researchers and associated with a number of publications, is still an open challenge. We address this issue by introducing Augur, a novel approach to the early detection of research topics. Augur analyses the diachronic relationships between research areas and is able to detect clusters of topics that exhibit dynamics correlated with the emergence of new research topics. Here we also present the Advanced Clique Percolation Method (ACPM), a new community detection algorithm developed specifically for supporting this task. Augur was evaluated on a gold standard of 1,408 debutant topics in the 2000-2011 interval and outperformed four alternative approaches in terms of both precision and recall.","inCitations":["032952bfa602e438adf925eae23c69a75868e60c"],"pmid":"","title":"AUGUR: Forecasting the Emergence of New Research Topics","journalPages":"303-312","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://oro.open.ac.uk/54345/1/JCDL2018_v49ANG.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3197026.3197052"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["4a7f578b03c11d94870bc2a16d83801772d139cd","76619c492cbc1337d2bf3379fae4888294aff0ec","cc6cd759ff0931d6ff31f0abddca26bbcc414d12","5d13213e9e0d855b6d8de4f151afaa059994841e","10609eeb5350a6cba45c69f3aa42a1ea10291ff7","07d862f8a69e09850b0c3ddc8404d3f89db26cd0","262932e4ea0afcc69b6cd356f3c1599329768abd","029a2aa5fcfbd9199f386c6d982514f5064b669d","190855040441ca0e506dc5e22171f034cf4e492f","0cc59976f427699f11eeeaa447edec5972348975","b3e3bb0d1fb41910d24f00fe620b3f38d77e17a4","d13eb74d54385c1e1ea70a6ff536c086fa6e7422","0a6df35624d83ee6094c433ef65772a4966880e7","c2fa4a40628bba36899bc105ff41e809b6755b3c","5e86ea7cfcc3a443f07ddabe8a70b2815f87552e","19b5131561363dd78774af75a3110c4f619cea58","02a8b5c2679fe441e25c9048674a438f8c5a7f39","3b1c7a7d01b2340ff96dbb9ba8c41a78c3e6c693","be99af09c1f967d9fd8c65af7d89d94e503b9b30","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","0d56ec5747eed5671471ddedfd10933c9b6b78a5","165185db8800bc47e7dcb40392b209982850785f","6bb98a3e41c3532af4e9fd0740baa86cfb72921a","97521dde2726de6d295ced52f3bb6eee5586f980","a1ca82f5a5aa902e3f25d486292e439765711f19","9ef91904e8e94460b196e3857b69380c749c3b1d","13c372b17594404b718af464db2cecdd9c59e465","09dd324b86176ec19dcdb1a4b14e16ecc84e1566"],"id":"893c016b051ac2bc6c400d1d6f782b0a423962c1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/893c016b051ac2bc6c400d1d6f782b0a423962c1","authors":[{"name":"Angelo Antonio Salatino","ids":["40520756"]},{"name":"Francesco Osborne","ids":["2052329"]},{"name":"Enrico Motta","ids":["1721851"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3197026.3197052"}

They may be trying to accomplish specific, short-term goals, or less well-defined, longer-term goals. While understanding user intent is fundamental to the design and personalization of online platforms, little is known about how intent varies across individuals, or how it relates to their behavior. Here, we develop a framework for understanding intent in terms of goal specificity and temporal range. Our methodology combines survey-based methodology with an observational analysis of user activity. Applying this framework to Pinterest, we surveyed nearly 6000 users to quantify their intent, and then studied their subsequent behavior on the web site. We find that goal specificity is bimodal \u2013 users tend to be either strongly goal-specific or goalnonspecific. Goal-specific users search more and consume less content in greater detail than goal-nonspecific users: they spend more time using Pinterest, but are less likely to return in the near future. Users with short-term goals are also more focused and more likely to refer to past saved content than users with long-term goals, but less likely to save content for the future. Further, intent can vary by demographic, and with the topic of interest. Last, we show that user\u2019s intent and activity are intimately related by building a model that can predict a user\u2019s intent for using Pinterest after observing their activity for only two minutes. Altogether, this work shows how intent can be predicted from user behavior.","inCitations":["4dcbfe41682fce6aa275f20d93cc268fa8d4e49c","f8692217167aa680e826389c46ab71ff3687eecb","dc69f55ab2d2f2ce57ff84f2006baf442089d95c","6c911f5726f4b642477f7d0404308b48517daf46"],"pmid":"","title":"Predicting Intent Using Activity Logs: How Goal Specificity and Temporal Range Affect User Behavior","journalPages":"593-601","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b2d6/9b3ec2ccd24c96d7e5ffd44bf962da0940e0.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/pinning-www17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054198","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p593.pdf"],"entities":["Personalization","Sensitivity and specificity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6232a369a867d57c9a4c139908c1be2785e5c278","cfe480d33e3657c9418f7662aa947f7774294ae6","ca7cb36d27d6b1491e813f59bea489a9e3716728","3ffa56ab34b55f719f461c41818ac542f96eec7d","45eb3f36b58aab6b77006e952cda1bcb6505140c","2d7f7c9dd68e86ef977a0294a35abb63d9c7bceb","b40567c71269c01c57330cce321d9147bc62a2e8","481fdffc1e0838ceedf45cffa0099bb40d6de2c5","b1068bea8618151920c1fef6cf456f7f58fb3756","505253630ab7e8f35e26e27904bd3c8faea3c5ce","be59652a90db393242dc95bcde049fc14cf8faad","f29e6fa8449f04702afd408d5c1b183401803c3a","7826ec6d0d72a6564930cd8c86774d01ad56b0d7","49919323144fc333b339ff9045a42c81b82e5598","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7","c8d62d81f28f61c30d8350400117c0346f18449c","8287444dbd740162d31f8433a3f35b47f78442ac","cb8b38c0f78a6998b683caf2086b3d13f9222454","4a22184b387362ff69e02110c924a7e646870517","dee170f457449131b769cb1cc5b8b522250f746a","19c9071f3c35c0d29587dbd05f74f96b97f587ac"],"id":"6fde46fac1b310b932f212c36d2f09a85fbc8cb7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6fde46fac1b310b932f212c36d2f09a85fbc8cb7","authors":[{"name":"Justin Cheng","ids":["1754378"]},{"name":"Caroline Lo","ids":["40144526"]},{"name":"Jure Leskovec","ids":["1702139"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3054198"}

Our work analyzes the quality of crowdsourced cellular signal measurements in the context of basestation localization, using large international public datasets (419M signal measurements and ∼1M cells) and corresponding ground truth values. Performing localization using raw received signal strength (RSS) data produces poor results and very high variance. Applying supervised learning improves results moderately, but variance remains high. Instead, we propose feature clustering, a novel application of unsupervised learning to detect hidden correlation between measurement instances, their features, and localization accuracy. Our results identify RSS standard deviation and RSSweighted dispersion mean as key features that correlate with highly predictive measurement samples for both sparse and dense measurements respectively. Finally, we show how optimizing crowdsourcing measurements for these two features dramatically improves localization accuracy and reduces variance.","inCitations":["af513246a2074936dea72209d6490f6326d48b85","5c1560bb754fa36b58fdca847d3c95f48752769e","9474319e459c8443fe420c2b1d154e81ad0037e7","c924137ca87e8b4e1557465405744f8b639b16fc","fc6ebde6d32e1320fdc1ccedcead9a9c7ab12c71"],"pmid":"","title":"Identifying Value in Crowdsourced Wireless Signal Measurements","journalPages":"607-616","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7e01/64ae48a47409f25a43e16e11f13d69575f2b.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p607.pdf","http://cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/crowdrss-www17.pdf","http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/crowdrss-www17.pdf","http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ysyao/papers/crowdsource-www17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052563"],"entities":["Cluster analysis","Crowdsourcing","Ground truth","RSS","Sparse matrix","Supervised learning","Unsupervised learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3915607cc304e983d9879d562ba18cef6d22e1a8","1e8b7fe00558c95f141d548fa460a4df47ef0769","016e8292b2eba4d592b75530681cf3652d1f94d3","22c74d8be071084ce8812af19548e7bf2bf0c8b6","0011deb6bd4598d486fbd7c5b5ae95c4e3c98eb1","93ca76b4241321f0b23ca62aa1432e95ca22e039","6bc43977fb11cceed0b9aa55b23c6dd29dd9a132","163f96887821402dcf39f24349853b99e8bb065e","2de8f887c0296fcf6c1be08dbbe94cdcd2176810","8cf434eb55e8ba77a90323880270ad7f1f194c53","922f18f7a4d9435d088eb9bf933ecd9dccc63a3a","09efdaca05ef061ed8f8d71cf9b3fe5d39e44844","47439480b8a13ea60aeef644f2f4aac0b3329a6f","686a83bc3f66cbde6d13e0dc3e045a2666ad72d2","54ed22e75c0ac8c2d245b343fbb6938b3cb4229d","10b6ac18bcd925e66bec6679de4ebfc6ec7e49a3","55061610b66adc3406b0b6592222ed74d55e0b74","159918ac1af869216f91ce8e73d8338ed8587d86","c3543736a6f6372dac4cd54b5b5e4acfe5b0f152","9e60973d109a138031d914e684f3dd784f266acc","18c4419c3137aff6c6def63c5fa3e67ab0326c80","acd117c9bdde1ac1a6f5d6db7a8051e42795387a","7a5fb834c9867f4f6b5222338300be206bd96dbb","5468f23ac5319f3808484fc62fd9dadeee39d755","db61ce862405ca89968f43fad8aff2e8136ccb41","b1d47b4a4599bdde2ca1e6d193bd14555ebb1358","6d8c9fcce8177d6f8d122d653c7d32d7624d6714","3ca2aabe703139caf2643b4de8102f2af633d928","34eda9d54ec01fed99068c2b66aa198008b99105","a0b8d8a04d09dbdbc4e8e32fb5fcb6616292649b","363608cb2cf0cbcce140bc5a08e3a1f31d7e1b8f","0f95daa6fc4339b7659ca602cb84083c1545330f","18b94ae2f53920d884f77e9aa8a32c80f3005759"],"id":"02df5e428a759091ffb9b3eb3f6542e0efab79b0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/02df5e428a759091ffb9b3eb3f6542e0efab79b0","authors":[{"name":"Zhijing Li","ids":["3318323"]},{"name":"Ana Nika","ids":["2240538"]},{"name":"Xinyi Zhang","ids":["49469835"]},{"name":"Yanzi Zhu","ids":["3104076"]},{"name":"Yuanshun Yao","ids":["3460027"]},{"name":"Ben Y.

The user-generated comments together with the commented documents form a unique correspondence structure. Properly modeling the dependency in such data is thus vital for one to obtain accurate insight of people's opinions and attention.\n In this work, we develop a Commented Correspondence Topic Model to model correspondence in commented text data. We focus on two levels of correspondence. First, to capture topic-level correspondence, we treat the topic assignments in commented documents as the prior to their comments' topic proportions. This captures the thematic dependency between commented documents and their comments. Second, to capture word-level correspondence, we utilize the Dirichlet compound multinomial distribution to model topics. This captures the word repetition patterns within the commented data. By integrating these two aspects, our model demonstrated encouraging performance in capturing the correspondence sturcture, which provides improved results in modeling user-generated content, spam comment detection, and sentence-based comment retrieval compared with state-of-the-art topic model solutions for correspondence modeling.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Accounting for the Correspondence in Commented Data","journalPages":"365-374","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/paper/p365-cai.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080781","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SIGIR17CCTM.pdf"],"entities":["Comment (computer programming)","Dependency grammar","Multinomial logistic regression","Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3","Social media","Spamming","Speech repetition","Text corpus","Topic model","User-generated content"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["71aaf59727081880d2833fb76d8f862048ce75dc","263f103fd2bfbbd6aeb392c6519d3f590e647c0a","5c6de157e19b49ff007f24c04c1f24d91addb6ba","ff02973613c2339f2dfcc95fe3c41cc72f0ca377","ef738810711edea9e2aa0aedb9c2eb1470661bf5","952c44bc56e54f64d0fe8247a3a2bd11c2188c61","12082a08377b7051360ef8be5a788adb2c024e98","682c434becc69b9dc70a4c18305f9d733d03f581","0ef311acf523d4d0e2cc5f747a6508af2c89c5f7","0c9d26f6cd9b7f8d98ea8cb30528d8f8497c9afb","4ae54170d96423730f12f2f3d30a8820e7250d5c","d15c57cb30c38da115e7ca31f2c6e3e5f1815ce0","dc6b0e6949f806d69f63445985ee8a7a1c551fff","40b7f6cdfbafb9586f77f3796c5343346bd4cac9","339817cf189cae4e91b39fb0c3284a72d5e81198","3cdda51886cf5b150adc66876392047ba05d22d4","3d74d241af53d85cbc74f73a785fddd675f0e644","9bf021126f96dbbf2c3968765003aaba0c826144","479effb344518acdc0fc301af393a75cd8bec40b","f0041b836d507b8d22367a6ef7faab583769de82","7314be5cd836c8f06bd1ecab565b00b65259eac6","a0628fc3e3324ec8906b09154cfff8b6b664fa7d","ad90445eb2b6615174981e3c36c9aa25754276b8","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1"],"id":"39395b0306fa9d7140ec0b4f46871a352b53dd18","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/39395b0306fa9d7140ec0b4f46871a352b53dd18","authors":[{"name":"Renqin Cai","ids":["39483735"]},{"name":"Chi Wang","ids":["48586386"]},{"name":"Hongning Wang","ids":["31825390"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080781"}

Generally, a QA system is designed to provide an answer to a specific question once (so-called single turn) and state-of-the-art systems reach nowadays robust performance in such a scenario. However, most of the interactions with QA systems are based on multiple handshakes of question/answer pairs, where the human being refines the questions further, while the system can collect the necessary information and generate a compelling final answer throughmultiple turns. In this paper, we investigate and experiment a multi-turn QA system that is suited to work given a particular domain of knowledge and configurable goals. Our approach models the entire dialogue as a sequence of turns, i.e. questions and answers, using a Recurrent Neural Network which is firstly trained to understand natural language, classifying entities and intents using prior knowledge of domain-specific interactions, and provide answers according to the domain used as background knowledge. We have compared our approach with state-of-the-art sequencebased intent classification using a well-known and standardized gold standard observing an increase of 17.16% of F1. Results show the robustness of the approach and the competitive results motivate the adoption in multi-turn QA scenarios.","inCitations":["919378ff1930c9b9519304588f72ed89867b8828"],"pmid":"","title":"Multi-turn QA: A RNN Contextual Approach to Intent Classification for Goal-oriented Systems","journalPages":"1075-1080","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1294/f64f05ed9616a74a69a76f3eabeff3d463a8.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://giusepperizzo.github.io/publications/Mensio_Rizzo-HQA2018.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3191539"],"entities":["Benchmark (computing)","Entity","Google Questions and Answers","Interaction","Knowledge base","Natural language","Question answering","Random neural network","Recurrent neural network","Software propagation","Software quality assurance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","7869fc49e9650b164a18f618f02b318ae41709f5","fb6fdc8874812f691ed7f1dca168e72304aeb1e5","1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002","2006f8d01395dab714bdcdcfd1cebbe6d6276e35","042db0977555fcd7d5eac67b26695cd918ecb44c","bfb00ba8118d6702ac440734df509fbfbf677bd1","290f6b98d15800753329b156560c32ffae9ba166","989aaca363a201fac4961965d1ea805ad96bc3f4","8e95526a02d6ddbadd11612baed19c78f504915b","e89ec98f2bd587b8a5301475372118eb9b544b20","197625aa6b0a12859beab16e182ef34b238c715b","42ab3412e8a85c32929c2dbdc970c35df89bf5b3","2230816965e900ba76f3fe75a9575a927b3466d5","46f13e76f2b673aaad013b92c9289d93e09221c5","b5eaa77d57b14669ed4b0143efe605f7c7392b9a","5b1fc2f3fa2cad5cb123748e7a970e553ae25b1d","20690b7465e6fef5337f0c9be0a302d33b3c9b3a","525867ebf15c535305f18eeb12b41b5d71168abf","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","4eb943bf999ce49e5ebb629d7d0ffee44becff94","4b459775f86584c35d3bc2eb8b2cf7d8569052e2","332c5ec3224813422a17be242ee2efa110c5b387","ae05ee0eae49941d520feb9904c59917074e6ef2","df0745ce821007cb3122f00509cc18f2885fa8bd","5b35981142209ad7d003ec4341b64f9a04005e10","763542e63ab6720759d0b9e78fb17416d25efa06","0c78b9f30fe762a7137b209174714bdc82cbedaa","33411bfd9c6c396739a101a7ec672cafd0dc7346","141378662f78978496e7be9005c8b73e418f869e","828c773ec37c9f3e5e245780ba37dae7466acdd4","1d19708290ef3cc3f43c2c95b07acdd4f52f5cda","a9eeb17b9cdb9f83f2e55ee5783a317fccc40e2f","00f31994c123fbceba5d5a0e06bb78aff651aae7","0c7f52c753a65ceaf3755e20b906ffd0c05c994a","0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e"],"id":"1294f64f05ed9616a74a69a76f3eabeff3d463a8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1294f64f05ed9616a74a69a76f3eabeff3d463a8","authors":[{"name":"Martino Mensio","ids":["40977598"]},{"name":"Guiseppe Rizzo","ids":["50310732"]},{"name":"Maurizio Morisio","ids":["1730588"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3191539"}

Artist labels are less subjective and less noisy, while certain artists may relate more strongly to certain genres. At the same time, at prediction time, it is not guaranteed that artist labels are available for a given audio segment. Therefore, in this work, we propose to apply the transfer learning framework, learning artist-related information which will be used at inference time for genre classification. We consider different types of artist-related information, expressed through artist group factors, which will allow for more efficient learning and stronger robustness to potential label noise. Furthermore, we investigate how to achieve the highest validation accuracy on the given FMA dataset, by experimenting with various kinds of transfer methods, including single-task transfer, multi-task transfer and finally multi-task learning.","inCitations":["ca5f3ba45c891a2fd62109a1ba0a628cdada5bb0"],"pmid":"","title":"Transfer Learning of Artist Group Factors to Musical Genre Classification","journalPages":"1929-1934","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e809/6f4f625441ddb4914b17d1b9da3f80bae92e.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3191823","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02043v2.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02043","https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/34581/Kim_WWW2018_tran.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02043"],"entities":["Computer multitasking","Experiment","FMA instruction set","Multi-task learning"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f9ea5bc230c597628ae56c334e1f0b57d132755c","6370d0c95cb2b7df6eaed66b4dfe284383e29a0d","6f568d757d2c1ab42f2006faa25690b74c3d2d44","01226d7b042bb91d10f5c9d0317e2531c1533e5a","013cd20c0eaffb9cab80875a43086e0c3224fe20","967836dca4808657e5af8000198df6b98b255ec4","0b8759d61e93b809df16d9fe9010d2a2d7241c74","1b02204b210f822dabf8d68b7e3ea7ac14ee1268","9241ea3d8cb85633d314ecb74b31567b8e73f6af","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","8f4ca94d4f96e1fcf81d6a8928a9ad9b744441ac","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1827de6fa9c9c1b3d647a9d707042e89cf94abf0","cd4b969a34d29d29c038d48f5a3a606feb37b5cc","2e43d80cade88c6a3596d083c3b4d7aebb03ca9a","f8f5ea1fb23510a86d5faba414a5e0c2ffed0809","562fbe1f8b8a77fbeb2adea42476752246b610e7","206d63c57430071a5b6efa261ff55122d0eed829","2259fe25b38783db2769e3e2f0000689e52d70ac","8a3c5507237957d013a0fe0f082cab7f757af6ee","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","ed90a00a7732935a4ca9c3816a9d6b3df9cf0cac"],"id":"a49253cfb4f602e26b260733b22cbf0dd5f79010","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a49253cfb4f602e26b260733b22cbf0dd5f79010","authors":[{"name":"Jaehun Kim","ids":["2744489"]},{"name":"Minz Won","ids":["28924703"]},{"name":"Xavier Serra","ids":["1786179"]},{"name":"Cynthia C.

Several recent works induce rules or calculate statistics on these KBs. Most of these methods are based on the assumption that the data is a representative sample of the studied universe. Unfortunately, KBs are biased because they are built from crowdsourcing and opportunistic agglomeration of available databases. This paper aims at approximating the representativeness of a relation within a knowledge base. For this, we use the generalized Benford\u2019s law, which indicates the distribution expected by the facts of a relation. We then compute the minimum number of facts that have to be added in order to make the KB representative of the real world. Experiments show that our unsupervised method applies to a large number of relations. For numerical relations where ground truths exist, the estimated representativeness proves to be a reliable indicator.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Representativeness of Knowledge Bases with the Generalized Benford's Law","journalPages":"374-390","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e0a5/5027d0c09a0cb00aa71a804cd517b5180592.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://suchanek.name/work/publications/iswc-2018-rep.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_22"],"entities":["Correctness (computer science)","Crowdsourcing","DBpedia","Data quality","Database","Enigma machine","Entity","Experiment","Knowledge base","Machine learning","Numerical analysis","Unsupervised learning","Wikidata","YAGO"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["b6ca4e88fd43e9eacfc4cb1b325bc5bd84be38cc","40c7099b31227f334607b488c880bfc578742e83","9855e41557c69771c1853b5d29448b7955146f84","65d7710326c059af852e6abeb6887fb184323ae3","4bc77cceed177d45d12e5e7e1c4f87f0d4f42ee0","c3732db6ce92ad9f1d6979bc7da6969c2b73dfef","4d49e6253cce19e312533dc1a58a8a7190523bb6","7a9fcb328ee638d36f83c28e0c3d8331aeab4dad","1f861fb55eca90f4ae1744ea7f36fbc5d0ef94af","5b35981142209ad7d003ec4341b64f9a04005e10","f140438f7ae801433d39f36c994743c9a9131337","05e10638aab94ca0d46ddde8083ff69859a0401e","cc88d3ea90449023874e7d5c257a3f3644ace023","28be19275227aca5ea6ebd54186f336ccc0e6fee","43dd3663744fed023f033df681221620d4736818","bf5468697828616906c96e162cdc919cb0831201","c8cf602073c3b71daef3d5cfc86bb8bd7113b59c","735c9805ba01706006379b8bc86fcd08de898c25","00a3f6924f90fcd77e6e7e6534b957a75d0ced07","8a4f515239eb71f92602d5e3ffea789f1d329072","2f230a46b4939fa75f266b8419f907dc0d4fb5db","2b2c30dfd3968c5d9418bb2c14b2382d3ccc64b2","edcfe5b2d498ad5b1eb6c9e637796cacb1da413a","6cbf0f7aac5486d139b3ecbf452b3702e381a857","7e15c4e193b965d31ac1d6d416e337526a2a0553","fe6fb365a77c1cd9113be046f4dd73ce49932e3f","d3dc36fdbd9999bd36f3d802096bbd9a57322632","4224bf43a3fcf4e2b6cce2e5a46a5a81e89510a2"],"id":"e0a55027d0c09a0cb00aa71a804cd517b5180592","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e0a55027d0c09a0cb00aa71a804cd517b5180592","authors":[{"name":"Arnaud Soulet","ids":["2955369"]},{"name":"Arnaud Giacometti","ids":["31498998"]},{"name":"Béatrice Bouchou-Markhoff","ids":["2050425"]},{"name":"Fabian M.

A common strategy for improving the understanding of natural language queries is to annotate them with semantic information mined from a knowledge base. Nevertheless, queries with different intents may arguably benefit from specialized annotation strategies. For instance, some queries could be effectively annotated with a single entity or an entity attribute, others could be better represented by a list of entities of a single type or by entities of multiple distinct types, and others may be simply ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning semantic query annotations suitable to the target intent of each individual query. Thorough experiments on a publicly available benchmark show that our proposed approach can significantly improve state-of-the-art intent-agnostic approaches based on Markov random fields and learning to rank. Our results further demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of our approach for queries of various target intents, lengths, and difficulty levels, as well as its robustness to noise in intent detection.","inCitations":["57c0925b87defad5fa62fa944ddf2204d0f371a3","dcd88d6ebd6f144caa3bd727a2253fb4744614b8","835a55d9fd0cd7f0c076fd60f030b07b7bc42c30","152b6f72a36deb8a9acf2d3737f6f557f78a44b9","6cb312f57d099b6135c3317a5b04e6ecd69061aa"],"pmid":"","title":"Intent-Aware Semantic Query Annotation","journalPages":"485-494","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080825"],"entities":["Baseline (configuration management)","Benchmark (computing)","Entity","Experiment","IT baseline protection","Image noise","Knowledge base","Learning to rank","Markov chain","Markov random field","MinEd","Natural language","Performance tuning","Semantic query"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8816995476050662c38a945d5fae3d67a7fc3bae","3eae360c6ee52950f27f577aedd5f9934a04e137","2d10744b3f6e1a8afd10abaca41c12f99cfffc6f","1454f8dce41bc7fd8148716e86e7755573404e93","3a197ce85e35890c15de0bca2f1b405037129829","607a834558b16c318be9c735bea048ae6638841d","b633205924265fa81d7d3ccabb37eee416a473a4","0b6aab9ce7910938e0d60c0764dc1c09d3219b05","04b35f36c2778b67f893177155c8e423419a464e","b78f9987638719b714a19202a33114bb46335a4d","4b2db5a1a6f5289c19ab2d10a6bc787658ff893d","1fe3833a07b81cf262f093b65ce05e95e870ab35","695deca3e6d1bbc290a81294280e4517ef2bb4a0","e1412f4fc47fcca1d84b513d3afcbc25568fe76b","1081a81d93c74d83c3fa0f7a78d3f987c117739f","7878cf925311291f53e45a2e0bdffe478b236682","021c1a63a103d320e42f7017a6f2b33abe28f4f4","dea266419175e64b5b543bd3b9ef11b52243f4c8","288959d9f0aed8138541c9a66d9a41c5fc0949ad","628d0fbc738d4707961426b9794f63966ddb71e0","69a613849e41c928ea4c6de046c46b413c371a7e","3c8c375f111366a7db47df0a9faa314f98734044","0f66ae3575cd750ec24fd89d5b5f6c17fcf40e22","9092bf4d0716ebd8c3ec931814aba2b84da9029d","6bee4f579e8bc07c00e854a04cf46e7ed7d73745","1d81f37488a6c492d5dd2733d485c9b014e9eeb4","0c795bc9673a7ab9aac7717abaa4f9e58e6754ae","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7","48a12a320ec4751096e9bb298bf16b4dfb29a8bf","00d37abb9ab0235c626d5eb1fd8bfc41092e8349","ed4c400e1a2a53bcbfb75ab2d07df131e67e7fdb","6a640438a4e50fa31943462eeca716413891a773","e6d408f935668672c64a9584fa614c24e72335a5","4752c1ee6ef02a122af7ecb60aa2f044f840e004","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","4ceb34fe6d20d271048306128896eaa8256149ae","021aac664fc1a2f5d3c4d833dec96289d77e2b5f","a22885072f39ad9900cbdaef6c59d15d75c3353b"],"id":"bdb94b816836f891495fe152de79ace1e3d14d9b","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bdb94b816836f891495fe152de79ace1e3d14d9b","authors":[{"name":"Rafael Glater","ids":["16935406"]},{"name":"Rodrygo L.

Examples include the National Digital Library of India (NDLI) and ACM Digital Library. Full text view generally requires subscription to libraries that host the contents. The problem is particularly severe for researchers, given high journal subscription charges. However, authors often keep a free copy in preprint servers. Sometimes a conference paper behind a paywall has a closely resembling journal version freely available on the Web. These open access surrogates are immensely valuable to researchers who cannot afford to access the original publications. We present a lightweight tool called Surrogator to automatically identify open access surrogates of access-restricted scholarly papers present in a digital library. Its focus on approximate matches makes it different from many existing applications. In this poster, we describe the design and interface of the tool and our initial experiences of using it on articles indexed in NDLI.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Surrogator: A Tool to Enrich a Digital Library with Open Access Surrogate Resources","journalPages":"379-380","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3197026.3203877"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Digital library","Library (computing)","Paywall","Surrogates","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2871f115e7a11c903258491c75d4171fac679344","023cc7f9f3544436553df9548a7d0575bb309c2e","daa957c767c501f0ba4af3cea699674f5fde389e"],"id":"40c0b7cb78762ff81587106c7cf4106c01c202d3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/40c0b7cb78762ff81587106c7cf4106c01c202d3","authors":[{"name":"T.

The data set presented regular patterns on how messages were spread over the network by users, depending on its content, so we could build classifiers to predict the topic of a message using as input only the information of which users shared such message.

This scheme strikes for tradeoffs between privacy and efficiency by proposing single-round client-server collaboration with server-side partial ranking based on blinded feature weights with random masks. Client-side preprocessing includes query decomposition with chunked postings to facilitate earlier range intersection and fast access of server-side key-value stores. Serverside query processing deals with feature vector sparsity through optional feature matching and enables result filtering with querydependent chunk-wide random masks for queries that yield too many matched documents. This paper provides details on indexing and run-time conjunctive query processing and presents an evaluation that assesses the accuracy, efficiency, and privacy tradeoffs of this scheme through five datasets with various sizes.

Presently, the mutual kNN graph is the most preferred as it reduces hub nodes which can be a cause of failure during the process of label propagation. However, the mutual kNN graph, which is usually very sparse, suffers from over sparsification problem. That is, although the number of edges connecting nodes that have different labels decreases in the mutual kNN graph, the number of edges connecting nodes that have the same labels also reduces. In addition, over sparsification can produce a disconnected graph, which is not desirable for label propagation. So we present a new graph construction method, the centered kNN graph, which not only reduces hub nodes but also avoids the over sparsification problem.","inCitations":["5785345695e6eddcfbd167a2a039d81d76c9a8a8"],"pmid":"","title":"Centered kNN Graph for Semi-Supervised Learning","journalPages":"857-860","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080662"],"entities":["Connectivity (graph theory)","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Software propagation","Sparse matrix","Supervised learning","USB hub"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["239b7176469d82330052403049b721b620d7faa0","888f9e5df2d0e26d335360e96b6866e5c1e3248e","15b2c44b3868a1055850846161aaca59083e0529","d01157e62da23c3bddd29ca71cc2af1cb39c9f37","775d0e6091be272171ebf40d2f431f1744bdc2ec","ac2262101f469154b133dbeece52318692fec205"],"id":"c724c83ea25c3896ee96f29f1a2f6a232796d060","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c724c83ea25c3896ee96f29f1a2f6a232796d060","authors":[{"name":"Ikumi Suzuki","ids":["2516592"]},{"name":"Kazuo Hara","ids":["34175367"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080662"}

However, their effectiveness is limited by the difficulty in interpreting the resultant prediction mechanisms or how the results are obtained. In contrast, the results of many simple or shallow models, such as rule-based or tree-based methods, are explainable but not sufficiently accurate. Model interpretability enables the systems to be clearly understood, properly trusted, effectively managed and widely adopted by end users. Interpretations are necessary in applications such as medical diagnosis, fraud detection and object recognition where valid reasons would be significantly helpful, if not necessary, before taking actions based on predictions. This workshop is about interpreting the prediction mechanisms or results of the complex computational models for data mining by taking advantage of simple models which are easier to understand.

However, there must be sufficient labeled comments available for training neural networks, which usually requires labor-intensive and time-consuming manual labeling. One of the most effective solutions is to apply transfer learning, which uses abundant labeled comments from a source news domain to help the classification for another target domain with limited amount of labeled data. Still, the comments from different domains can have very different word distributions, which makes it difficult to transfer knowledge from one domain to another. In this paper, we accomplish cross-domain emotion tagging based on an advanced neural network BLSTM (bidirectional long short-term memory) with \"domain translation'', which can overcome the difference between domains. A weighted linear transformation is utilized to \"translate'' knowledge from source to target domain. An extensive set of experimental results on four datasets from popular online news services demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed models.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Weighted Domain Translation for Online News Comments Emotion Tagging","journalPages":"821-824","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080653"],"entities":["Internationalized domain name","Long short-term memory","Neural Networks","Statistical classification"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["12cd48792e7960cdf39e4506f407b26cf07cec29","377889687e1dcac5abf54d94e341ef199560a283","0157dcd6122c20b5afc359a799b2043453471f7f","94db635f54d25bdb95edb42185aca93ba53b051b","2c5135a0531bc5ad7dd890f018e67a40529f5bcb","4b8089bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba"],"id":"1d142221b889bc909bf3500a9116ae130b50e503","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1d142221b889bc909bf3500a9116ae130b50e503","authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhang","ids":["46867447"]},{"name":"Li Yu","ids":["46274888"]},{"name":"Xue Zhao","ids":["50061963"]},{"name":"Xiaojie Yuan","ids":["1721029"]},{"name":"Lei Xu","ids":["40448210"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080653"}

This motivates the question if it is possible to generate a summary of events from this rich set of tweets only. Key challenges in post summarization from microblog posts include circumnavigating spam and conversational posts. In this study, we present a novel technique called lexi-temporal clustering (LTC), which identifies key events. LTC uses k-means clustering and we explore the use of various distance measures for clustering using Euclidean, cosine similarity and Manhattan distance. We collected three original data sets consisting of Twitter microblog posts covering sporting events, consisting of a cricket and two football matches. The match summaries generated by LTC were compared against standard summaries taken from sports sections of various news outlets, which yielded up to 81% precision, 58% recall and 62% F-measure on different data sets. In addition, we also report results of all three variants of the recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE) software, a tool which compares and scores automatically generated summaries against standard summaries.","inCitations":["8d7607b5bc6b1627f30d61976ef543a990a15cac"],"pmid":"","title":"Post Summarization of Microblogs of Sporting Events","journalPages":"59-68","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b441/e591db6eff3801783134c5a1d49a940cb3bd.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3054146","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p59.pdf"],"entities":["Cluster analysis","Cosine similarity","F1 score","K-means clustering","Litecoin","Match moving","Spamming","Taxicab geometry"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["22272f8b59ebbac76fb53a71d76b5f1dc113d1fe","d86ffc45cac718cce3974f23d8b006f0cc38bd6f","0dd5e618579061d70b93ef6dbb407663a8ab165c","6b204e084cfb74d9ef4bb504aa4133807a198613","c0f293d40fbf71bf4627de91918bc2cce3ad2ea3","71439278086b7fc84eedc8aeba377747e00b8403","039b08ab33e94c18e4976bad3bc363a9f8d24213","3e8f99514a816cfc0a6149c0c6c69b65aa4c7761","189d2ee0d8ad9224da7240dcf085b2b79af6d1c9","0c15871fa4c94d91acafa6bf29d67ac2ce972913","34410651619eacffb05da28985b550a79a8d11d4","255e97d82f528b613dbe8883727abfd14f3f9f39","0fefaf2fe831d318380fe3a6eb81254277d7d780","598ae927883728b4c5df6d9a833d7dcd19832b57","44fca068eecce2203d111213e3691647914a3945","e3bdf77e53aa191be64b431a2e040a7762a86728","7a65f23d990231d461418067c808b09d84c19b2c"],"id":"b441e591db6eff3801783134c5a1d49a940cb3bd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b441e591db6eff3801783134c5a1d49a940cb3bd","authors":[{"name":"Mehreen Gillani","ids":["9132681"]},{"name":"Muhammad U.

Different from other systems, CoNEREL processes articles and comments in batch mode, to make the best use of the shared contexts of multiple news stories and their comments. Particularly, a news article provides context for all its comments. To improve named entity recognition, CoNEREL utilizes co-reference of mentions to refine their class labels ( e.g. , person, location). To link the recognized entities to Wikipedia, our system implements Pair-Linking, a state-of-the-art entity linking algorithm. Furthermore, CoNEREL provides an interactive visualization of the Pair-Linking process. From the visualization, one can understand how Pair-Linking achieves decent linking performance through iterative evidence building, while being extremely fast and efficient. The graph formed by the Pair-Linking process naturally becomes a good summary of entity relations, making CoNEREL a useful tool to study the relationships between the entities mentioned in an article, as well as the ones that are discussed in its comments.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"CoNEREL: Collective Information Extraction in News Articles","journalPages":"1273-1276","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210165"],"entities":["Algorithm","Batch processing","Entity linking","Information extraction","Interactive visualization","Iterative method","Named-entity recognition","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["f0ca32430b12470178eb1cd7e4f8093502d1a33e","128d2482c0968cbd7639ecbe7dca97c11cf51570","beb126da785608cd531c4d178c1b56f7b68fa0b1","743f3041effeabfbae3e8e179bf993386f2876a9","5b2eccea3438a28d48496e73f818a7bfa9e3bf45","d535d71a7266ae90c5153b5c64feb63912ccef04","723bcd04f88d72338ee0ed5efd0294e799aa1c6d","4f410ab5c8b12b34b38421241366ee456bbebab9","1c909ac1c331c0c246a88da047cbdcca9ec9b7e7","ababa2333fc22d3e3d2e5ec75c816506471c4a03","837b071d4c83e0f90d3e6b6edc1a2d4ca35711fb","3a7210732592a60ee1ec9ab259c77b5bb4197142","261b447f58db876247bcdd5343a5c79fbcf01268","196d7e0a43587b0216c47a1ddb8cb1875aa1c1d0"],"id":"3d050e1f70fbe67ccb7a34146200e85d9a456387","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d050e1f70fbe67ccb7a34146200e85d9a456387","authors":[{"name":"Minh C.

In this paper, we propose techniques for cross-linking news streams based on the reported events with the purpose of analyzing the temporal dependencies among streams.\n Our research tackles two main issues: (1) how news streams are connected as reporting an event or the evolution of the same event and (2) how timely the newswires report related events using different publishing platforms. Our approach is based on dynamic topic modeling for detecting and tracking events over the timeline and on clustering news according to the events. We leverage the event-based clustering to link news across different streams and present two scoring functions for ranking the streams based on their timeliness in publishing news about a specific event.","inCitations":["03f6304cd3a914ea33bcb24acb9e40030a1ab821"],"pmid":"","title":"Linking News across Multiple Streams for Timeliness Analysis","journalPages":"767-776","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3132988"],"entities":["Cluster analysis","Reblogging","Scoring functions for docking","Sensor","Timeline","Topic model","Trust (emotion)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["113a0a371f8572bc8f8adab9ba8d126be8eebaa1","383f1f2ceb32557690b6a0abf6aab48cb98552ff","69fc8c03d21e22e30d6642824c37158b314f36c3","215aa495b4c860a1e6d87f2c36f34da464376cc4","277c68718ebdf79be1d79cb957ac468fa4519277","22da4cbfa4e29da9a43996324c318dd33b947b48","de20b12ebf9fe5c4c74a7bb75239e0b45c587b1f","2b0750d16db1ecf66a3c753264f207c2cb480bde","49b2a1b9606c0ccb95a36895760fc91b8b830266","920871663e6016e59cac6396311355e723dd499f","1e009f0b145193d127fd715598f385825dbae09d","6873a4db9703c9bf38ddabf9abed17ac5b673b59","2a917c6c42b49b54328ef99d9f31566125fdbda4","7e7343a5608fff1c68c5259db0c77b9193f1546d","5681bdb617589eca3aa09d3aa703fe6e449ac15e","979384ad39ad8808b7b038ff9451e30255d55b3e","1b255cda9c92a5fbaba319aeb4b4ec532693c2a4","48aadadafa7122356815d43599ac098903076d00","9a7c156fe8f728b480c23ad5d82a457e781d6bb2","132f7b35625b21b043d0226c4a7135c4ef78e38a","9e4291de6cdce8e6f247effa308d72e2ec3f6122","30ecac29a22125bcc713a928a94aa0ade247ec31","0542b5458de3efad67d77af573c60a73b7da0fbd","3d378bdbf3564e341bec66c1974899b01e82507f","01ff2b834772dfc2b8b7ba00620b65abb9444a75","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","3a3507e1280589281fca32117709cadbc30bea0d","8b6219d4bd81952b2feff780354c68f1e5c90963","c3a5ee3eb7e35cf960cab3c17ea8ea5abfcab9a4"],"id":"27ffb5b00737113ab8810955afa3aad72af9dfd2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/27ffb5b00737113ab8810955afa3aad72af9dfd2","authors":[{"name":"Ida Mele","ids":["2577635"]},{"name":"Seyed Ali Bahrainian","ids":["3091795"]},{"name":"Fabio Crestani","ids":["1714210"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132988"}

Such systems are increasingly deployed by Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare and Yelp to enhance their usefulness to users. Recently, various RNN architectures have been proposed to incorporate contextual information associated with the users' sequence of checkins (e.g. time of the day, location of venues) to effectively capture the users' dynamic preferences. However, these architectures assume that different types of contexts have an identical impact on the users' preferences, which may not hold in practice. For example, an ordinary context such as the time of the day reflects the user's current contextual preferences, whereas a transition context - such as a time interval from their last visited venue - indicates a transition effect from past behaviour to future behaviour. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Contextual Attention Recurrent Architecture (CARA) that leverages both sequences of feedback and contextual information associated with the sequences to capture the users' dynamic preferences. Our proposed recurrent architecture consists of two types of gating mechanisms, namely 1) a contextual attention gate that controls the influence of the ordinary context on the users' contextual preferences and 2) a time- and geo-based gate that controls the influence of the hidden state from the previous checkin based on the transition context. Thorough experiments on three large checkin and rating datasets from commercial LBSNs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CARA architecture by significantly outperforming many state-of-the-art RNN architectures and factorisation approaches.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"A Contextual Attention Recurrent Architecture for Context-Aware Venue Recommendation","journalPages":"555-564","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/160908/7/160908.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210042"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["043ae0ffa13c3b6b356a1d2a9859dcf2876388b3","73e3fda9287eda0c8d4e17b365a18d68f1a65bd0","596e0fe7550663727e304c5de32fc041fc5957a4","e1b93001202afd674cc3542cdb5599bff0d10157","0c60805cd71725cad770db897801d149a97788ce","665a99a77b3d07859d56dd78ceda17c2ce226195","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","0dfd1181f8b866a7f0b3e5f63574d7998c778be8","34e9cfe143f8eb2e3c451c165ac53eec0a9a0449","0d5489d236c2616b7438a29bba1cd438536ba3c1","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","ab443bd7e732374caabb5785b8d37bbfc724c845","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","e50f4d3316d13841c287dcdf5479d7820d593571","7028c325f161611f6bce252083c4815b61be9927","b93a14feca57295a13dfc0a8da0a1a9c87b5b520","12dbc3a120cf724a421af387a2b47e8fa15bf814","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","657fbf29ea0b4904a3e98d1556f9acf38dddae5f","1b4fb68c5241b87d9fb0479029e10e64ecca2695","0c87a70a9b9575c178e2399e6101cf11dc248d1e","3d1f9a530e710fdd4e2313bda4c8a1f574e60ab6","629781b0d1cb7d7589b45dc4937ae59ad591ce72","6c62cc81e5d8267749a5f67c2a544553c5c4459b","5bdf0970034d0bb8a218c06ba3f2ddf97d29103d","9f21521e2e89bd257b8f3fbcb1625180bb498da5","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d","50054b2cafde87fb71cfbfed966a7ddc0feada50","870785ccda65e577bfe5bb3c3db03379e19fa950","18fb605aff0296c2bc7515fdc258a634e53a3024","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","763caad351b26a0c18cc2a363e67c738ad4071fc","e6df5b3a9202d534b94d8ba40e8db1b6ae259fe5","2e635989e232816546ef352edc38881580b04c1e","357487e338c13e5593841e5d42f4829d7fd30a4f"],"id":"f0b8476b2fec3aa4b64dc752c53f1e70b1e18cd1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f0b8476b2fec3aa4b64dc752c53f1e70b1e18cd1","authors":[{"name":"Jarana Manotumruksa","ids":["2072304"]},{"name":"Craig MacDonald","ids":["2691614"]},{"name":"Iadh Ounis","ids":["1698205"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3209978.3210042"}

Hence, this article argues that the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 must be understood as a caesura not only for conceptualising development, but, in turn, for conceptualising ICT4D, as well. On the basis of literature review, this paper analyses the SDG framework and applies it to theories of ICT4D, outlining the implications of transitioning to the post-2015 concept of sustainable development, beyond the cosmetic reflex of adding an \u2018S\u2019 to the acronym. In doing so, this article aims to sensitise the reader towards the challenges and potential dilemmas emerging from this transition, which go far beyond the Agenda\u2019s new topical areas, and to spark debate on how to conceptualise ICT4D in response.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"ICT for Development in a Post-2015 World: How to Conceptualise ICT4D in the Context of the Sustainable Development Goals","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b18d/e114ed0cd2d6251cac8df946593c5f3eda43.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://perspectivesonict4d.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ict4d18_paper_11.pdf","http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2120/paper2.pdf","https://websci18.webscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WebSci18_Events_PreProceedings-11-Web_and_Digital_Divide-lres.pdf"],"entities":[],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7359eff7806178f0b88e57cd397a941677ae0732","aac28cee68fea77c1d4845899893f3d83dd6d9b7","9538bac1a6244b2a1c759fa05cf083c2254a6ef7","087f567843cc6d963ce23938253c596c9d45faa9","70d714cce0a973c7bda4b65d65cdb916a54fc3f5","4338c0f578bbc0d92a64fecb09a33b68ba8f9129","23f124127950bdcb221c82b2cbf425d108deec21","0b065a1be74b7537b125da518cc545b621390cfb"],"id":"effb149ca147804600d3dbb81e905fd2c13781a0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/effb149ca147804600d3dbb81e905fd2c13781a0","authors":[{"name":"Franz-Ferdinand Rothe","ids":["51285874"]}],"doi":""}

In this paper we examine the retrieval consistency of a set of five systems responding to syntactic query variations over one hundred topics, working with the UQV100 test collection, and using Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) relative to a centroid ranking over the query variations per topic as a measure of consistency. We also introduce a new data fusion algorithm, Rank-Biased Centroid (RBC), for constructing a centroid ranking over a set of rankings from query variations for a topic. RBC is compared with alternative data fusion algorithms.\n Our results indicate that consistency is positively correlated to a moderate degree with \"deep'' relevance measures. However, it is only weakly correlated with \"shallow'' relevance measures, as well as measures of topic complexity and variety in query expression. These findings support the notion that consistency is an independent property of a search engine's retrieval effectiveness.","inCitations":["e3511072e3cd03592b1209fde804a194c1640cf1","3bd105221c102d83d7f66affe8382b3c321efc4b","f39d0d1d1be98232977f797aec4469d10444c2e1","61a9d991413e112ee95ccdac177ec684738103bd","26bcfffe1740d3fd8c88e60760e139d1f489af99","f7db53b60694ed860bd5a269606c72aa44e7e0ea","36d9abbbc4735a9dbd75f57f8f5602bd80d6b0b1"],"pmid":"","title":"Retrieval Consistency in the Presence of Query Variations","journalPages":"395-404","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3077136.3080839"],"entities":["Algorithm","High- and low-level","Information needs","Information retrieval","Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences","Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3","Overlap\u2013add method","Persistence (computer science)","Relevance","Role-based collaboration","Strand (programming language)","Usability testing","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["3a5066bcd59f81228876b6bf7d5410c63a82f173","9533cce453af80638bb2914a929fc5c866b2d2b5","b9d26526def969c055c51d6280bbd7e6aba99342","076077a5771747ad7355120f1ba64cfd603141c6","74feeb26daa4d1fe4b7ac85b17efda55d277b41b","978dfe8ac0c1be5160e4c508f921381905e146dc","88ab65123f2a842ac8f8843dbd76b62e226b91cb","63fc4a2735a9b3425f55aef15714ff3d706dc511","93a28b52f0273be80db1c2c9e7fdb2f03bf45797","16d37154f46cd07db579fd9c147ec4c6419e5bc4","9bae51fce09dd0ce3d5202e340002b79871c78e8","2d2c6555c538636531c2c1bdfe30f08693c17b72","3bb44af2251b89c83a922778be5ba50cc205cc8c","0b271ce0ca450df10c5c71328b913f2ac81b7e48","6b3853f08c482fe1bfbe39d656d50a8c73976f3c","f7d6d33d98cfb20aee2b2215716fc602f851c447","5b8d41c7bb3747c4eab6c243210e11a72b5c829a","52aa034a1c1413e03e7895dab0a0b67549cf92e1","28bcb617022a93e2f00cf4f96138bcdf048f5309","46a3afe1ef550dd29973ac0ce1289162a71642fb","ccf72f8c0262a9ccc981be62b126105786a391b0","5651e259f329d3461ddf519ae19273cc1622cb0a","f4ee0e688036509aa5e9d10a8abba4acef25e305","2f53b548e05776c24c048351e35df15b00642a76","313921607a8c32cf87a50a005f7f655034e5d015","0a2d9ec95a7e5b212be1369f2daa110d09f22821","03d648e07baba55bc7376f8174894b606bda7c59","07603546b52cfe07b13f64c79af1fda45e47b6f5","3a8a544153d9761024844d6a05619f535b14dca8","5b82f2c8e2f3de485b81d9527952746a17f020d6","2fa2afbadc78bd53ec0493a9f4c9d1de2757f3c0","14b69114783f65bb9f5245dbfd08323da0cc550e","471cb4c2e5039bdaacb0274fee70c7fe2e93493e"],"id":"5f05544e68687b1bea8a15d08c7aff91bd9401c1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5f05544e68687b1bea8a15d08c7aff91bd9401c1","authors":[{"name":"Peter Bailey","ids":["1848040"]},{"name":"Alistair Moffat","ids":["1751760"]},{"name":"Falk Scholer","ids":["1732541"]},{"name":"Paul Thomas","ids":["47023002"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080839"}

Significant progresses have been made in domains where plenty of labeled training data (i.e. image-text pairs) are readily available or collected. However, obtaining rich annotated data is a time-consuming and expensive process, creating a substantial barrier for applying image captioning methods to a new domain. In this paper, we propose a cross-domain image captioning approach that uses a novel dual learning mechanism to overcome this barrier. First, we model the alignment between the neural representations of images and that of natural languages in the source domain where one can access sufficient labeled data. Second, we adjust the pre-trained model based on examining limited data (or unpaired data) in the target domain. In particular, we introduce a dual learning mechanism with a policy gradient method that generates highly rewarded captions. The mechanism simultaneously optimizes two coupled objectives: generating image descriptions in text and generating plausible images from text descriptions, with the hope that by explicitly exploiting their coupled relation, one can safeguard the performance of image captioning in the target domain. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we use MSCOCO dataset as the source domain and two other datasets (Oxford-102 and Flickr30k) as the target domains. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms previous methods for cross-domain image captioning.","inCitations":["619a5c54981238fd9c31300c5a45857338742d32","e78e6cb26f4e15101a7f97522b8b20ce9e4f31d5","19fe2802dc88b6b1eb89b4adb6e676c1c9b86480","63800207c40cad535c880ef9845f49f2cdefa50c","d353b30b9ca3124fad08e3bdc8167dfe994efb34"],"pmid":"","title":"Dual Learning for Cross-domain Image Captioning","journalPages":"29-38","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132920"],"entities":["Academy","Gradient method","Natural language","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["59927ded86ab4f7253fc32efb351e5a13e746ead","052373d7fd12145c41377f9a05513596d32e409c","255e97d82f528b613dbe8883727abfd14f3f9f39","dd9a9175fa952a3888da3aafba13e777588dc574","108961c7366e36825ffed94ac9eab603e05b6bc6","02b28f3b71138a06e40dbd614abf8568420ae183","828a7b3122ebd5b8b0c617902bc04ac5a6c60240","160315c07d18fe785aff07f50c9e44319a0af0cb","2dd8a75ea1baca4a390a6f5bb24afd95d7bb0e1c","167096707eb580cbd14cdcf8324709afdd473171","8ff93cfd37dced279134c9d642337a2085b31f59","8e4ab54564fb492dcae9a1e862aedd3e52fb258b","b9ed0bb4aae5d89c48ce2ce372f2891c228fe0f8","35c1668dc64d24a28c6041978e5fcca754eb2f4b","5287d8fef49b80b8d500583c07e935c7f9798933","c221cc946425d85f93c86e3be2c31d4feb00faa1","7533d30329cfdbf04ee8ee82bfef792d08015ee5","12441a74e709ddab53f9039cf507491df7b3840a","5060e2e7d94e002a5376f4edfd2e48ac01d6221f","6b40f545d3d3f18b62112ba8d0e51feaad12d16a","dd90dee12840f4e700d8146fb111dbc863a938ad","355de7460120ddc1150d9ce3756f9848983f7ff4","c6222824b95750be2ed98b2a9f3f9d361a529115","24115d209e0733e319e39badc5411bbfd82c5133","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","ef3c1f6c177e37f1d0d2a61702b60c766971700b","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f","3d275a4e4f44d452f21e0e0ff6145a5e18e6cf87","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","07e1762fc9b1ca346529ac9f5357823b3f2673bc","04483e2c56695b19f6912b061769eb8c175a5a7a","665a311c538fc021c27acd3953f171924cc5905c","5e0f8c355a37a5a89351c02f174e7a5ddcb98683","3f6a4556769e819242d669d073b895f1e45a706f","11da2d589485685f792a8ac79d4c2e589e5f77bd"],"id":"3844a6cef7960729125722e2d07024058dd9204a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3844a6cef7960729125722e2d07024058dd9204a","authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhao","ids":["38695118"]},{"name":"Wei Xu","ids":["47210488"]},{"name":"Min Yang","ids":["31991405"]},{"name":"Jianbo Ye","ids":["34452876"]},{"name":"Zhou Zhao","ids":["2322317"]},{"name":"Yabing Feng","ids":["28106616"]},{"name":"Yu Qiao","ids":["40612284"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132920"}

A main challenge is to leverage collected knowledge about the daily online behavior of millions of users to understand what engage them short-term and more importantly long-term. The most common way that engagement is measured is through various online metrics, acting as proxy measures of user engagement. This tutorial will review these metrics, their advantages and drawbacks, and their appropriateness to various types of online services. As case studies, we will focus on three types of services, news, search and e-commerce. We will also briefly discuss how to develop better machine learning models to optimize online metrics, and design experiments to test these models.","inCitations":["eb0139023edc22ac63994c0493d91f3413f7db44","dc3f342803766ed68bf80da6ec0f380d0b59cb76"],"pmid":"","title":"Tutorial on Metrics of User Engagement: Applications to News, Search and E-Commerce","journalPages":"781-782","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3159652.3162010"],"entities":["E-commerce payment system","E-services","Experiment","Machine learning","Norm (social)","Portals","Social network","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9b1823898a89e2be3a60f5d4b26bd771496ae5c9","21697f9e4ced5f10ade4d785a8be936ca6e888d2","c4806efffa95a727006d2d6284240f2c181f75ab","ea238b71c3fa1240e9526fc33d1d8269f09fd9a4","59e8a0371a8cdaf24cdc3e3c0f5e7e6f2d6a1251","7fd68e8d2b2680cb3a94b2f3d774de80cccba3f6","2be1a80ad40c8d54d69e089b9a2db59fb1b2d599","44c990cdec924eedbea7d21e39452cb6b0e4f3bd","7a1a88cf191bfe305c98d867945156591affa9af","a5203a54528b4ff60c6d1078087e82829b39e365","0a7f190fc133f75b1add56f62d1102a69565c75b","c0c0990b84a350d5efde8d3b2cb2636b6b57c21c"],"id":"62e9f62fc3674a0eae52a4b9112ce6758c17abfa","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/62e9f62fc3674a0eae52a4b9112ce6758c17abfa","authors":[{"name":"Mounia Lalmas","ids":["1684032"]},{"name":"Liangjie Hong","ids":["33888728"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3162010"}

To reduce the impact of the curse of high dimensionality, we incorporate a dimensionality reduction method, Locality Preserving Projection (LPP), into the recommendation model. A joint learning model is proposed to achieve the task of dimensionality reduction and recommendation simultaneously and iteratively. Specifically, item similarities generated by the recommendation model are used as the weights of the adjacency graph for LPP while the projections are used to bias the learning of item similarity. Employing LPP for recommendation not only preserves locality but also improves item similarity. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed method is superior over state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":["defd9cbada8c8c6eafaf47148ea3e9445e30729a"],"pmid":"","title":"Top-N Recommendation with High-Dimensional Side Information via Locality Preserving Projection","journalPages":"985-988","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080697","https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/chen-top-n-2017.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Dimensionality reduction","Experiment","Format-preserving encryption","Locality of reference","Relevance"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["caecd3cd42ac98ff5bba0438e16fe1d6afbbf23e","124a37515c7da761916311789d95aaed303f3eec","b0c6a5f8bf43653339aef121c5638568c93e22a5","29770c627c0e3ff68dd6cf6d9d1e342daf074289","3b0c39b323a8cc1a90b3fdee83dad2fd417bd0ce","33883e161fabf893c6e2d505f3a2834448b3250e","1535d5db7078c85f0e2d565860a0fb4053a6090c","8728d9d59f4cff64b8706422ec0f2b5bdf75df0a"],"id":"39d5b6228efe7c9d38337193856fa21419e9d3f7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/39d5b6228efe7c9d38337193856fa21419e9d3f7","authors":[{"name":"Yifan Chen","ids":["1774449"]},{"name":"Xiang Zhao","ids":["48551377"]},{"name":"Maarten de Rijke","ids":["1696030"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080697"}

The former refers to forums or E-commerce sites that emphasize user-item interactions, like Trip.com and Amazon; whereas the latter refers to social networking services (SNSs) that have rich user-user connections, such as Facebook and Twitter. Despite their heterogeneity, these two domains can be bridged by a few overlapping users, dubbed as bridge users. In this work, we address the problem of cross-domain social recommendation, i.e., recommending relevant items of information domains to potential users of social networks. To our knowledge, this is a new problem that has rarely been studied before.\n Existing cross-domain recommender systems are unsuitable for this task since they have either focused on homogeneous information domains or assumed that users are fully overlapped. Towards this end, we present a novel Neural Social Collaborative Ranking (NSCR) approach, which seamlessly sews up the user-item interactions in information domains and user-user connections in SNSs. In the information domain part, the attributes of users and items are leveraged to strengthen the embedding learning of users and items. In the SNS part, the embeddings of bridge users are propagated to learn the embeddings of other non-bridge users. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our NSCR method.","inCitations":["97cefa2f54d30bf40b2bf71a9297949ed5a327ee","e7d11d43489e29f500f34126013ef44b26cacab2","c872b5e0ba1e9a397641e5861d106f20f10f76f9","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","40238df63d52dd553fb330984273c4447da9e832","1b2084f46e1133624438f87d3c3edba0bfd053fc","434fd8ef8dbb88a33e0d70a90d0ddec2417757a3","67d0fb46b20c1b6de37c8497c21a0b38a83e7cfc","11e5a445219640a0378ac74fdc9f76e3174a9663","95eed16871a747d3ee5e372da404b30fcc5f7298","3613f86d0e0424e02d4eabc250735ad73a273a20","295f0d02324b4c45faa006e4a074c94f1ed421c6","519da94369c1d87e09c592f239b55cc9486b5b7c","12b161b4256292a338fac99317465c295092d710","fd35d68737cf8fee9b5fa979fc02d9932fbfe608","b5c3c7893cf503bff7ef4f962056d7055f19c0f5","6ba4e10d06d9842765a4350bf5abbd3dd095045c","7c720ab3a223306097de769d63f4f6d87ca7f402","3c21d2985d4d1b3c140b991c59e936682719b197","39b4d14b4e8c05afd0e13b7962cf9bf36a7be95e","2b971928e1bf079050a9cdabeb9a7d940f5ca3f6","05b1fba34674cd7b7ed3fd1baffc4166961a95b9","081ad92ce0e71541646218f11061c86414a960c2","d5de6f3fb6de20344c145229c3c8d618cc7ea353","d5dc71aa641a2bb50d20edae277c7fe3ce366718","3d1f9a530e710fdd4e2313bda4c8a1f574e60ab6","89a4ad6cbfe4088794e859b3b7f0bc42b5f19ba7","40e59046535c2b5d1a606dbdb33d64a6618b9aba","1346cef688f2c3431cf35ccfff558c08e04d5bd5","24f4b7b1e770db25e2d388fcfe22f6ad99a6b386","f91fbb865a0c7f0c2e7e515755cd48611b03437b","057b80e235b10799d03876ad25465208a4c64caf","61781520b20986f2defc7f31eee004d957490e98","ee21dc39d96204720756e2618e8cdb20058890e8","9cbf32e778128e1e07e309ec644e1654de9fa98b","6264736e6a92379a3aa4bca92c5bcf5dc1b5575e"],"pmid":"","title":"Item Silk Road: Recommending Items from Information Domains to Social Users","journalPages":"185-194","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/sigir17-SilkRoad.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03205v1.pdf","http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/sigir17-SilkRoad-slides.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080771","http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03205"],"entities":["E-commerce payment system","Experiment","Interaction","Rationality","Recommender system","Silk Road","Social network"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["878a34fd9e1af1f1371ffbd897dbe8c3c54fc85d","1e7d7f76b3a7b494122f40c22487e60a51a2d1be","794f63b0ddbd78156913272a7f4275366bbd24e4","71423bb17133402965a5cbaf31fa28b0366149fd","2eb32b1a4c5bf741632a9fd5f852253fd0d53def","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","50d53cc562225549457cbc782546bfbe1ac6f0cf","b2180e693766bb31e88110ad8a316ca9886a44e5","26b99024682a897888428f727805967b032d0a54","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","907b51d5201214cb2e8eec810260050dda19be89","40e59046535c2b5d1a606dbdb33d64a6618b9aba","2ef7d506b25731d0f3ec0c8f90b718b6e5bbd069","0988e0c825d376c32c7f1fd2393102251e514ba4","1d9b302a5a004e279b984f35d01190cb59658c50","43c0ff1070def3d98f548b7cbf523fdd4a83827a","fc8d2643020c6208cf99778744e07fe01626316c","52c0876b25a5721c4c6930d94d5308f0779734ec","dbe9d04bffb5c1df8eb721dab4f744ea81d9a4c1","760948698540118031e590fbc884fcea209f9104","7894683e9f0108245d43c3de91a3426e52e0d27f","eccf0fd40c9a70165eace5c2ba53db1085548339","d5a55a548fc7cd703c1dd8d867ca1eb6b0c0764c","4f86dbd3591106a5645b5d5be4c8c9a16aa5d9fc","2607f0093fecd4fee5244d56fcf3f53ff22e949e","85ffdd0aa82aca2c2c942ce3e84cae64065dd7a7","9285f3c70c6cab770d2f7d4ccb32ecae0397b134","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","e50f4d3316d13841c287dcdf5479d7820d593571","61181e71ca1b899b5fdaaac24daac2463b3e6c96","5720a5015ca67400fadd0ff6863519f4b030e731","787d56ec5569f1054f490dcf9a9fb4b87b7990e8","3d1f9a530e710fdd4e2313bda4c8a1f574e60ab6","84ad75dd2bb8aef4b70c5f7db6ff947767c30264","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d"],"id":"d2941a495900c7b8cc46fcb357c0d2c5d7d086e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d2941a495900c7b8cc46fcb357c0d2c5d7d086e1","authors":[{"name":"Xiuli Wang","ids":["10966012"]},{"name":"Xiangnan He","ids":["7792071"]},{"name":"Liqiang Nie","ids":["1743245"]},{"name":"Tat-Seng Chua","ids":["1684968"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080771"}

If this party identifies the story as misinformation, it is marked as disputed. However, given the uncertain number of exposures, the high cost of fact checking, and the trade-off between flags and exposures, the above mentioned procedure requires careful reasoning and smart algorithms which, to the best of our knowledge, do not exist to date. In this paper, we first introduce a flexible representation of the above procedure using the framework of marked temporal point processes. Then, we develop a scalable online algorithm, CURB, to select which stories to send for fact checking and when to do so to efficiently reduce the spread of misinformation with provable guarantees. In doing so, we need to solve a novel stochastic optimal control problem for stochastic differential equations with jumps, which is of independent interest. Experiments on two real-world datasets gathered from Twitter and Weibo show that our algorithm may be able to effectively reduce the spread of fake news and misinformation.","inCitations":["d544e5d8c252319f288f08969cc3d3c0d02797d9","eff57ffb739564a8c2b8996908a481c921d90f29","a4f5fd6f54e3a6222fbc5d8e0b7f85ce89d0237e","1856d07f955cad7498f01673c89fd9f088eaba12","483e366e729773ee493571950f0a7f5d8e82940e","16b22d9e92b1ce80906f831c9f6222d9794d7089","da0f719d41ac6acc5630652628d917b1a24e6022","069ac0e642e48ff08b3e261d110294cbcadc8df7","0997315ed8a23c230f84d70221786d1ca3bd9cf5","56e12020e7e9d6ba7152ba8b1b789876da365de3","0a94492593d8124e218f100877e80e3d68c06c1d","de1f192f34f4521ed5cabc8db1ff608c5ee11bcc","7280a725a276fdf7505132f2be4d74599a6ed127","d1234bc63fae2840b7e4b3d6956665d5f96beaf9"],"pmid":"","title":"Leveraging the Crowd to Detect and Reduce the Spread of Fake News and Misinformation","journalPages":"324-332","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.k4all.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WPOC2017_paper_4-1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09918","https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/pubs/reviewers-misinformation.pdf","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3159652.3159734","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09918v1.pdf"],"entities":["Bilinear filtering","Experiment","Fitts's law","NP (complexity)","New Foundations","Online algorithm","Optimal control","Provable security","Regular Language description for XML","Scalability","Sketch","Trust (emotion)","Trusted third party"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0695867087a5c1c0ddecba9634835952f18b46f4","2ffe1157df90ce94cb91f28074b43b58135cedac","1354ba1b6567f869065e9515a488bc031a00e25a","0d7c4a408b1bfedd0c19db92812fbee0515d564d","ce04e3232aea12b6d0d37ee2e7c1e4072f6365a4","2141a4655f65c09dce412bc9125d960b453ed64d","0a146116a5869877829c4cf362df373b30b64d8e","1b763ec4c21c799eef00ca26f6afc6c01b45a82c","0318f19753bd9d42128150d9a7d27dda0a8da96e","0fe9218d06078df0fdd9462c161c8256ad859bc5","a12a068054488415264eacda4786bfe0b5fec7b5","af2a807c5e32a35765850c6b6891f471d7bc7aea","743dda41540066d377e9f17c7f31c02fb012e5e5","2d59aad86b841c6d1404b28c8d6ebefa53222784","433c20c54f2268d7e3ea416b9c9c528f673f9801","66bb61b78999bd7a02b552318736ec3f6d64b4a7","2cc0807e33e83b04df005b55003b934414ccf2b6","ca66ee90a262281922bd2eb0a55ab5f340385dfa","5f39e48ea21412da169b847a8a24b6ca61763ae3","d746cd387522d826b2ab402cb37c96059fa04261","dc79d0de2f38ca0380650cf7e7c66a87837c59ae","2e268b70c7dcae58de2c8ff7bed1e58a5e58109a","1a3c39eb219a6e2e5e252db8a5663c886aa32417","139f4aad228c43e095808b7b24eeb634c9da58f0","6d5b35b3d29552d5ddf06340fec82495b3d05cd2","c9cc4712777d2e8d1f385f965b444190a5e4dca1","0bee052af002eb197277cd222d62154c7de4ac8a","8b60a0321f31eda486883600eaa9d7226fda8e63","af026e6a9be1e1ef5b9e264de15d30c45a0155f2","453c5a0ff2b97746de65153a2ea39799458585e7","1e3d1055fc65966bc2c64505785207d7e8d71022","0d0da3e46ad8a8fd79ec4b689e4601e84dad9595","bfc07bc8cc2e39bd2e408528711ed6a34a76bd0b","9dc68e2efb04627239ed4c8338e301e372083da1","41f1ebd4c8486614f5830794220df217281d507c","4607f09a348c87f95aedd7711b24d8bf614fe58c","04a5042b55db8f8af4cce4982a191ae9eace1cb2","9a80c4089e2ef8066b4b3b63578543b5b706603e"],"id":"24e56a1b8e1d4f32efc64a220da19f948a2942e6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24e56a1b8e1d4f32efc64a220da19f948a2942e6","authors":[{"name":"Jooyeon Kim","ids":["3119731"]},{"name":"Behzad Tabibian","ids":["2153776"]},{"name":"Alice Oh","ids":["36003137"]},{"name":"Bernhard Schölkopf","ids":["1707625"]},{"name":"Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez","ids":["1719959"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3159652.3159734"}

Such an unbalanced presentation might just as likely occur on Wikipedia, one of the most popular knowledge resources on the Web, since the encyclopedia has already been found to exhibit such tendencies in past studies. Under this premise, our work assesses gender bias with respect to the content of German Wikipedia articles about professions and occupations along three dimensions: used male vs. female titles (and redirects), included images of persons, and names of professionals mentioned in the articles. We further use German labor market data to assess the potential misrepresentation of a gender for each specific profession. Our findings in fact provide evidence for systematic over-representation of men on all three dimensions. For instance, for professional fields dominated by females, the respective articles on average still feature almost two times more images of men; and in the mean, 83% of the mentioned names of professionals were male and only 17% female.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"\"(Weitergeleitet von Journalistin)\": The Gendered Presentation of Professions on Wikipedia","journalPages":"83-92","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q36317574","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03848v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03848"],"entities":["Computation","Crowdsourcing","Programming tool","Unbalanced circuit","Web search engine","Wikipedia","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1459717829506dd1f8c9b7c1c7a6e81e9e92fcd9","54f11d6dff520022d00b2ea4c307d24d05b92e64","2b3d70e3c9ccb360029ecda27319b7ccd1f76600","d4acefdb9b5b6bbc76a75a6a70c48a4dd9efcfe5","531bc31aa70981cc989180f6e3f7d3c6442e7d14","7f6029bc6536d568771feac4b2e19b851e61fb2e","165111af64a34d5769f3ee8cbeada5c6618cf8c7","70b017433b32868e56682e97b1fbe271c939fae0","31ac020736515476e3e165c4ec59d1f7a21a692c","a140556b31bf5e566cf25301e2bc8422934257e5","58edd95b593fe5237e0f0bda2f4d09f94b3f3353","c65190983cc01dc23bdfde5b7aaaf6a388dcab75","3d505c5eff8752ac1805ef546d683bfa40aec4b1","154cd03bc6a6fa673ce41faca461ca8dfb001815","05e10638aab94ca0d46ddde8083ff69859a0401e"],"id":"b6be5d00f324ec91cf5e83d4978aeee92861b3be","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6be5d00f324ec91cf5e83d4978aeee92861b3be","authors":[{"name":"Olga Zagovora","ids":["9542883"]},{"name":"Fabian Flöck","ids":["1724463"]},{"name":"Claudia Wagner","ids":["3120824"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091488"}

Retrieving the top k most relevant documents for a given query can be extremely expensive, as it involves scoring large amounts of documents. Several dynamic pruning techniques have been introduced in the literature to tackle this problem, such as BlockMaxWAND, which splits the inverted index into constant- sized blocks and stores the maximum document-term scores per block; this information can be used during query execution to safely skip low-score documents, producing many-fold speedups over exhaustive methods.\n We introduce a refinement for BlockMaxWAND that uses variable- sized blocks, rather than constant-sized. We set up the problem of deciding the block partitioning as an optimization problem which maximizes how accurately the block upper bounds represent the underlying scores, and describe an efficient algorithm to find an approximate solution, with provable approximation guarantees. rough an extensive experimental analysis we show that our method significantly outperforms the state of the art roughly by a factor 2×. We also introduce a compressed data structure to represent the additional block information, providing a compression ratio of roughly 50%, while incurring only a small speed degradation, no more than 10% with respect to its uncompressed counterpart.","inCitations":["15e9923ce3509a63e8108e851d291008aa4fb353","e3511072e3cd03592b1209fde804a194c1640cf1","6e2ecfde192df2d3e9f25f858776a7336965b03d","f39d0d1d1be98232977f797aec4469d10444c2e1","6dcab868c9fbc8d34ffceab1912aa359906930c7"],"pmid":"","title":"Faster BlockMax WAND with Variable-sized Blocks","journalPages":"625-634","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080780"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Compressed data structure","Data compression","Database","Elegant degradation","Information retrieval","Inverted index","Mathematical optimization","Optimization problem","Provable prime","Provable security","Quantization (signal processing)","Refinement (computing)","Space\u2013time tradeoff","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["21c6caa930b2e76fe70e427c77a3e0a1b86c2514","738f8c4daa3090ed0c08e8b012014f757be8f168","c463f666033883327eb43c6df504173dd6d950b3","09d75defdd4c9632e3f8a569d8193c51ea66ca8e","a50970770c8804febb8755f65787a3a0411174f9","237f8ae5cd9dd51cb7f09d1ea09c5cbd2fbfb084","7e39821fc23fcb78108995839994e4ab0442142e","48fe4acbe59e450e3a86cf709c217493b743a87a","16a66728e5550a9c1b1127da3b429c66a25540d1","0a717685158723040c56b42d67fc8988fab9fc73","1719d5d60933883ce21c822a6f94bf33ef6066fa","0221b18d99c15f8e045f8d42653a3a3fee9f44f2","67ed21d665a1ad5ca668c4282122f6128bbb2f53","d4ace73d54ffca372d79136c9811728704a5e74d","c458b2718b1cbcb94794432632df8aa03becda3d","b648925030b450502ca5fa956561c243a7d01ba9","66713fbcb8d5e48a9eb6425bd7fdbb53751e60b1","20548990990c447ab54a3ecba82af2b5443a01d6","89d27fc4c5bf15762d001a39f0a74f84c89d3681","030f6132f6b6b3336ce9b0b29c5ac4c1e368b7dc","04e2d423b03334d0a91b551016ed8e84c228fd5a","aef1f8de55aa3db14bffc119e6529c4ed6886167","393d1f3b81410536944dff9514a2b787094e846d","7321b709e5489f59f1124ca2f41ba17cdbcc1ad9","91a353974741cdcac274f8dfeabde87430fbc05b","dc75b2811d2cd01b30fa850351aae2e0fa092cfe"],"id":"a1a68124a923bf681415998ff69e9e73e3295ad8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a1a68124a923bf681415998ff69e9e73e3295ad8","authors":[{"name":"Antonio Mallia","ids":["39662889"]},{"name":"Giuseppe Ottaviano","ids":["3230478"]},{"name":"Elia Porciani","ids":["22269520"]},{"name":"Nicola Tonellotto","ids":["2783910"]},{"name":"Rossano Venturini","ids":["1797933"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080780"}

Existing methods rely on a clear separation between an offline training phase, where a model is learned, and an online phase where this model is deployed. Two major shortcomings of such methods are that (i) they require access to a large annotated training set that is not always readily available and (ii) they fail on questions from before-unseen domains. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents NEQA, a continuous learning paradigm for KB-QA. Offline, NEQA automatically learns templates mapping syntactic structures to semantic ones from a small number of training question-answer pairs. Once deployed, continuous learning is triggered on cases where templates are insufficient. Using a semantic similarity function between questions and by judicious invocation of non-expert user feedback, NEQA learns new templates that capture previously-unseen syntactic structures. This way, NEQA gradually extends its template repository. NEQA periodically re-trains its underlying models, allowing it to adapt to the language used after deployment. Our experiments demonstrate NEQA\u2019s viability, with steady improvement in answering quality over time, and the ability to answer questions from new domains.","inCitations":["b3a9aa01ccc504fd9ffab3bbf5377662e7438a93","a3ee76b20df36976aceb16e9df93817255e26fd4","16e0488c75bdd9c36450bb9e1c76b6d482500fe4","9516b08a55ff710271104d70b9f12ce9c2eb9d4e"],"pmid":"","title":"Never-Ending Learning for Open-Domain Question Answering over Knowledge Bases","journalPages":"1053-1062","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a80a/0ed4597d0dcb9f8d09009afbfa76e4ef621c.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~abujabal/publications/neqa/neqa-paper.pdf","http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~abujabal/publications/neqa/neqa.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q52160109"],"entities":["Experiment","Natural language","Online and offline","Programming paradigm","Question answering","SPARQL","Semantic similarity","Similarity measure","Software deployment","Test set"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1103fcf21250b5ac67a3bf3477a036162297b113","b21b4837d20749e674405ae4953cad57c893e768","1e4cfe280c97d4dc6cb69138cc370e9d81c13d17","0eee094383b4ef1ccccae9d50aa9edd60116de1a","12fa4a3ee546ba8eeb0b88b06bcb571d65d91cc4","40eb9fb2dc89e2de7762ef5d5d77741fba571459","c5ae092897581c41ed6b172841c4699f770db5f9","2fc760267d7e052e584cf55b641539e913df55ef","f24eefd8d53208b2eca0bf9bbe34d01004e10133","8e95526a02d6ddbadd11612baed19c78f504915b","9d2bfb28ea197ec1a0f4266aefde2f9129638193","53073cf42228f7e1d23c513eb474c7e599f82c02","8488adaa261f9a3be7e03acc2693ae4397b0eecd","2a48c649fad6a5545380a02607147d97947d4acb","042db0977555fcd7d5eac67b26695cd918ecb44c","2230816965e900ba76f3fe75a9575a927b3466d5","cb4d277a51da6894fe5143013978567ef5f805c8","3c0d94608ce09f481cb9532f0784e76bec3e2993","1976c9eeccc7115d18a04f1e7fb5145db6b96002","84f134f0472b43f998cba05162ff6b41c12659c3","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","42414b70fc61def8adcf5c159604c72e4508e9c1","36ea668bb7617b9c1e6e98aebe96a0aaf90b569e","3978fdea81d2198ef64d18183623719db6f106d1","2d03baec8ac1568e6813aa43d625d552524f977e","2994608bd3ed7ef582403135f21041e5ca25d9d8","00a0639b59ac2d44ff9eed3992023265a2d69864","0fe96806c009e8d095205e8f954d41b2b9fd5dcf","e3d308b4e9b6cc90f24de1a97ceecaebe051667c","af752f78c71a523e760febad54d855397c00f165","593d514bf119316842185c32639e3478edcdb849","4ae093d626e17670ede21200f9cf1790e8c23dc8","ba2a2884dc831c79d4d26b675872b8633ad3a81d","94dc02825b80910ffbb1a029e85f8231f3845e21","91af39b4e7423da9bde6350b6e0ab4351ad2e142","2b2c30dfd3968c5d9418bb2c14b2382d3ccc64b2","6e565308c8081e807709cb4a917443b737e6cdb4","8f8139b63a2fc0b3ae8413acaef47acd35a356e0","33261d252218007147a71e40f8367ed152fa2fe0","46cb32eec63d625e32c0ce99744c4c256a9a13fa","79cd660c697d1f628b0083c09051d9ec39f40148","8aef832372c6e3e83f10532f94f18bd26324d4fd","4db2330c32989a7f4e392980fc61a4773e1b0e32","0e04c49e6ced2be382b7abd27f7e3e53471bb0d9","25369f56a933e3bfb1d8e1588cdc6c50df93ecae","445c8907f09c649da1c0e70f26d15d44667b5152","097665e66a05d316ad0e649fec374db44a485bda","b52c1b64ba302460aad5dbb2e0ba239be55f5e38","3adf41984ca96649adedc1fa4d3c69cc8404d00f","f0ec25cb2e7a17fed5eae185a5b779c1c0704719","20ad0ba7e187e6f335a08c59a4e53da4e4b027ec","1081a81d93c74d83c3fa0f7a78d3f987c117739f","014782be8ccd40118e88520b97e492105a547254","1ece7cf6ed61faca8481a7da4ca7159506672c85","0f32cd9cf29ec55b9a54dd5a4adf80b03e0ac08d","3689102f44116a46304ec512594478a1c615ae02","32ce5467ff884d2f90a233f4d9606c6e18b1a9d6","1fe2575798c98a66f9a674ab40f1fdc7331f8ad7","13eba30632154428725983fcd8343f3f1b3f0695","1d7d7362c1e4b1544fd4ce2af7c65f9f47ffeb82","80c2d8c691b09f8b4e53f512b9d2641b49fda935","fa9890e7fca761f164ab8112e1699154d67bc635","d237072bae2bb7ab3c0e3ea10959c05df5384311"],"id":"a80a0ed4597d0dcb9f8d09009afbfa76e4ef621c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a80a0ed4597d0dcb9f8d09009afbfa76e4ef621c","authors":[{"name":"Abdalghani Abujabal","ids":["1977813"]},{"name":"Rishiraj Saha Roy","ids":["40075164"]},{"name":"Mohamed Yahya","ids":["1795788"]},{"name":"Gerhard Weikum","ids":["1751591"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186004"}

In this work, we explore users' dual identities, including both personal identities and social identities to build a more comprehensive opinion influence model for a better understanding of opinion behaviors. A novel joint learning framework is proposed to simultaneously model opinion dynamics and detect social identity in a unified model.

To do so we collect a new dataset from the Steam video game distribution platform, which is unique in that it contains both 'traditional' recommendation data (rating and purchase histories between users and items), as well as bundle purchase information. We assess issues such as bundle size and item compatibility, and show that these features, when combined with traditional matrix factorization techniques, can lead to highly effective bundle recommendation and generation.","inCitations":["74c89a8388f8a48f843a7707e4c9b98e83f32510","fb698241a9a6dec0ddd3e0bf85485ee0e31cbb6a","e291788bc51d7e8c51c6f4701dcd954a80dafe61"],"pmid":"","title":"Generating and Personalizing Bundle Recommendations on Steam","journalPages":"1073-1076","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/sigir17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080724"],"entities":["Greedy algorithm","Personalization","Population","Recommender system","Steam"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["e8f6fe44e76a540626ef485837aeea12cec8b02d","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","80632dda887a909fbdaedd0bef24439c5147bafc","7fe73dd079d14520224af718c12ab3e224d40cbb","5261d414ab222a53c0cedd37d61999cd72c044b3","33b668614fde65d2ed44a60a4bb8c8b6bc9793bf","37d3ddb0723edb194d9de489ca6615cbe792ebc8","1a932850aa9b155bffef3c52e6b51633cf2f1956","92bc4403e1c763a03a3ddb7acc06f71feafa97a1","177130eec6082dab7694d9e0a1a1ce2a219f682a","2f41ca10c5f695091a399dcc551e99e6fe8a75e2","80f1e5db87fdd3b29a9837592938e1ce7440e980","029fc5ba929316c5209903b5afd38df3d635e2fc"],"id":"118a0278dc3e0a653c3cf19b132c44632d7a1e13","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/118a0278dc3e0a653c3cf19b132c44632d7a1e13","authors":[{"name":"Apurva Pathak","ids":["41094779"]},{"name":"Kshitiz Gupta","ids":["47211339"]},{"name":"Julian McAuley","ids":["1814008"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080724"}

Presumably, an Euclidean semantic space hypothesis holds true for word embeddings whose training is done by observing word co-occurrences. We argue that clustering with word embeddings in the metric space should yield feature representations in a higher semantic space appropriate for text regression. Also, by representing features in terms of histograms, our approach can naturally address documents of varying lengths. An empirical evaluation using the Common Core Standards corpus reveals that the features formed on our clustering-based language model significantly improve the previously known results for the same corpus in readability prediction. We also evaluate the task of sentence matching based on semantic relatedness using the Wiki-SimpleWiki corpus and find that our features lead to superior matching performance.","inCitations":["2211cbe7670c43c2c4d39b43241901f395e07b34","f91f6eb09fff4a0717a20f7ca10c2d25df9e070e","2c138f927708ea50aebcfbc07430e1f734693655"],"pmid":"","title":"Language Modeling by Clustering with Word Embeddings for Text Readability Assessment","journalPages":"2003-2006","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01888v1.pdf","http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~htk/publication/2017-cikm-cha-gwon-kung.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133104","http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01888"],"entities":["Bag-of-words model","Cluster analysis","Experiment","Language model","PA-RISC","Semantic similarity","Vocabulary","Wiki","Word embedding"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["42ddc23cbc2c479ef5ef907d8945a648137384c0","288f5d916d90d986b23d06660d89c71adfb1bf92","783480acff435bfbc15ffcdb4f15eccddaa0c810","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","ba88d1bb1ac9a6bf01ff55bc53ac8d73b7e87687","4c15b129a8da55127e4e2fe47f54799d0a313367","637a2c0efa953bc5d8f00e797e6cb4606d640a11","b635ca5bfe2c566f0cacd1b710827b3904c6417e","10ab45df501d7900fe560d8ae57f0287af695998","50e983fd06143cad9d4ac75bffc2ef67024584f2","0a6383b13794452fb7339a7f8a5384885186ccf6","e9b6cc38a45fc80dfbbac65e4f249770d90e8611","f6c035de37e797f7e5167d655b246a2f9426a9eb","5a4f7c894f4560c3205978d9277d744a910560f6","8811bf77f0dbbd2802413a3229208b0bf69970ca","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","02df3d50dbd1d15c38db62ff58a5601ebf815d59"],"id":"4b97d661e24d670c6c4fc9a901d282152a48e320","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4b97d661e24d670c6c4fc9a901d282152a48e320","authors":[{"name":"Miriam Cha","ids":["3041555"]},{"name":"Youngjune Gwon","ids":["2163133"]},{"name":"H.

Singular-value decomposition is used to decompose a large term by document matrix into 50 to 150 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination; both documents and terms are represented as vectors in a 50to 150dimensioal space. Queries are represented as pseudo-documents vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents are ordered by their similarity to the query.

Existing works in the literature that operate based on a known interest space cannot be directly applied to solve this problem. Such methods require at least a minimum user interaction with the topic to perform prediction. To tackle this problem, we integrate the semantic information derived from the Wikipedia category structure and the temporal evolution of user\u2019s interests into our prediction model. More specifically, to capture the temporal behaviour of the topics and user\u2019s interests, we consider discrete intervals and build user\u2019s topic profile in each time interval separately. Then, we generalize users\u2019 interests that have been observed over several time intervals by transferring them over the Wikipedia category structure. Our approach not only allows us to generalize users\u2019 interests but also enables us to transfer users\u2019 interests across different time intervals that do not necessarily have the same set of topics. Our experiments illustrate the superiority of our model compared to the state of the art.","inCitations":["433fefd5334cc42d31784c264bcc89645e1b1aff","d5da718bdbe7373be152f9e5a4f571ae154d6945","cb9196b46370f942f4bf50c5583ed452704d1f3f"],"pmid":"","title":"Predicting Users' Future Interests on Twitter","journalPages":"464-476","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3105/f25c032e4c5e96f7484d60974de4c7b9a40d.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_36","http://ls3.rnet.ryerson.ca/papers/Predicting_Users'_Future_Interests_on_Twitter-ecir2017.pdf"],"entities":["Category utility","Experiment","Wikipedia"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["c9b41a66017ca13333e8477a58ffdca2e3599b7e","34b49026d61b3c308bce9ba5cf4ae8305f09d0e2","d556f50b4cd41a140f52008860e3ab18552b4d6c","1f310dfe9d43ed1c7ea61df02a9f092c1bc7f389","17cfdd2f69e16bbcf5ce1f706dd789587d717331","bf75d4e8b9a2b21653dcfbfb8183d10a77474091","e97ec3738ef0819b51d9b6c74bdd1f9771367d52","4efb678051e7c00017c8e743bc45d72a2a2a7f42","38e752758a51bea833b25c7f7ebd067c34c6fc9f","512ceea7c302ec9eaf824e780dc1d4469478ca9b","1b43764e763f7e6fc1583392cbbe6a2bb05def43","79d2e523a19d6dc0ae361366672c332efadc5b7c","b23e6b8df31d74fa8e0be2177f1727b06daed549","687e2981d007ec267430fa4346841f0d443d0fb2","6ce18f996c5d8fb6855fdcf256ec0915ec7523aa","e6e765a230007880f6f4c4514c8055c6b49de7f9","3531e0eb9ec8a6ac786146c71ead7f8d624fd2ca","3ed422c393b9ce37fb7d3a3b76bb5e2419ecffd6","01a7bd7e0b3f36772697b7036b2fc66805fc2313","46e1e1f4b106f570292b359e456fe998217ae489","41b4473c17690464422ac58493c4178751512b21","2661ffabe6aecb2c67cfb0e3bbac7e8c9e3ad32c"],"id":"3105f25c032e4c5e96f7484d60974de4c7b9a40d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3105f25c032e4c5e96f7484d60974de4c7b9a40d","authors":[{"name":"Fattane Zarrinkalam","ids":["3086812"]},{"name":"Hossein Fani","ids":["1973214"]},{"name":"Ebrahim Bagheri","ids":["1684650"]},{"name":"Mohsen Kahani","ids":["2841105"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-56608-5_36"}

The structure and development of authority networks are reconstructable owning to the well documented archive materials, reports and recorded interviews. The research focuses on the informal relations latent in authority networks. The corpus of the analysis is built by great amount of textual data mainly originated from reports recorded on party committee meetings. The quality of digitalization of these documents takes place on the wide scale of perfect readability and perfect unusability; therefore, it is a huge challenge to process these documents.

The whole model is learned end-to-end using entity salience labels. The salience model also improves ad hoc search accuracy, providing effective ranking features by modeling the salience of query entities in candidate documents.

However, existing algorithms for PCA have limited scalability since they explicitly materialize intermediate data, whose size rapidly grows as the dimension increases. To avoid scalability issues, we propose sSketch, a scalable sketching technique for PCA that employs several optimization ideas, such as mean propagation, efficient sparse matrix operations, and effective job consolidation to minimize intermediate data. Using sSketch, we also provide two other scalable methods for deriving singular value and 2-norm of reconstruction error, both of which are used for data analysis purpose. We provide our implementation on popular Spark framework for distributed platform. We compare our method against state-of-the-art library functions available for distributed settings, namely MLlib-PCA and Mahout-PCA with real big datasets. Our experiments show that our method outperforms both of them by a wide margin.

As a result, the typical information trail that a user must follow while searching to achieve a learning goal may be an inefficient one involving unnecessarily easy or difficult content, or material that is irrelevant to actual learning progress relative to a user's existing knowledge. We address this problem by introducing a novel theoretical framework, algorithms, and empirical analysis of an information retrieval model that is optimized for learning outcomes instead of generic relevance. We do this by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates a cognitive learning model into a retrieval objective, and then give an algorithm for an efficient approximate solution to find the search results that represent the best 'training set' for a human learner. Our model can personalize results for an individual user's learning goals, as well as account for the effort required to achieve those goals for a given set of retrieval results. We investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of our retrieval framework relative to a commercial search engine baseline ('Google') through a crowdsourced user study involving a vocabulary learning task, and demonstrate the effectiveness of personalized results from our model on word learning outcomes.","inCitations":["1807e79d0efdb88f53dd56214f37f618a35eef70","50608a5f47dacfa21a7a1aa9a5df37e2c6977041","0c3faffe2c21147280e23b189cc448e24b7cef01","bfca58d69b80ead742b46298852b1205537c8c04","dea298b4ba2934a30955fc804c000750e0157ec4","77a9bf5331212676ee2c46e66e69608d35c84046","bed38665d8f565b91eafc2edd3b2c484fc7865bd","dfdfcdb7ee0f280a139ad353bffd903161f03a5a","bcb47bbf0a630838b0c27897d2ec49e4c24e3026","b4da4041ea6dbc84aa1ed6593ca51a42a0fb26b4","e781cf698b81fc7417f0ed9671b1c4577b128b4e"],"pmid":"","title":"Retrieval Algorithms Optimized for Human Learning","journalPages":"555-564","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3077136.3080835"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Baseline (configuration management)","Computational model","Crowdsourcing","Data science","Information needs","Information retrieval","Mathematical optimization","Optimization problem","Personalization","Relevance","Test set","Usability testing","Vocabulary","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["8d7c2404fd67574a3b07602aad90e89141eb9622","0a10d64beb0931efdc24a28edaa91d539194b2e2","8e6d963a9c1115de61e7672c6d4c54c781b3e54d","a29851811df8435a8d686a9c43c912f43dc06ccc","40b42731dbb4c8ed6a03fbee44b945b55c00f19a","4d2cee58708c2d1467a683553c9d4f75b00a6b85","5abca53c6c57f5264df6e40bb5ea2f09602bf506","f7d4359b0090a775a1251e6c640701b16e25147a","dea298b4ba2934a30955fc804c000750e0157ec4","3a3679965ab4ef93409097be5898c68a51d81ea8","31c6b7b6b8a4ca6de749d874b29b07fbb2290ff5","7149d9be2c394dc48c678310af4cbf404c4cf64a","8faacb2148f97ab6e417d871ebc0614bf6fc2cc3","012927ab94f0e542ce137e032b0288bbfbc2f9ca","8a1905a3bc9071a0a111ec4029175cf5cff1b305","38cb9bc50282615e0631d47825c5e0c7f691c3f7","dea266419175e64b5b543bd3b9ef11b52243f4c8","0708037f8b6af7ca166a8c53ad362de063fb9809","42771aede47980ae8eeebac246c7a8b941d11414"],"id":"abbb22faa83910e0f087c217a5a7a84ce9bcc1eb","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/abbb22faa83910e0f087c217a5a7a84ce9bcc1eb","authors":[{"name":"Rohail Syed","ids":["3388401"]},{"name":"Kevyn Collins-Thompson","ids":["2582990"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3080835"}

As a preliminary study, we focus on the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) models that have been theoretically studied using the axiomatic analysis approach. In this paper, we introduce two novel interdependent PRF constraints which emphasize on the effect of existing constraints on each other. We further modify two state-of-the-art PRF models, log-logistic and relevance models, in order to satisfy the proposed constraints.

In XML keyword search, query semantics is based on the concept of Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), e.g., SLCA and ELCA. However, LCA-based search methods depend heavily on hierarchical structures of XML data, which may result in meaningless answers. To obtain desired answers, a successful system should be able to (i) match a semantic entity for each keyword, (ii) discover the relationships of the matched entities, (iii) support efficient query processing, (iv) release users from having the knowledge of the XML content, and (v) visualize the search results. None of the existing XML keyword search systems completely meet the above requirements. In this paper, we design a system called SpiderXto completely solves the above challenges. We propose a query semantics Entity-Relationship Graph (ERG), which adopts the RDF subject-predicate-object semantics to capture the information of search entities along with associated attributes and the relationships between entities. SpiderX proposes a novel index structure, which has small space cost by combining the optimizations of column databases and the data compression schemes. In addition, SpiderX processes queries in a bottom-up way to achieve high performance, which is about 100× faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms. To demonstrate the high performance of SpiderX, we implement an online demo for SpiderX, which operating on three real-life datasets. The demo also provides (1) query autocompletion to guide users to formulate queries; and (2) visualization panel to display the query answers, which interacts with users by providing zoom-in and zoom-out exploration features.

However, in recent online services, the user identification may be usually unknown and only limited online user behaviors can be used. It is of great importance to model the temporal online user behaviors and conduct recommendation for the anonymous users. In this paper, we propose a list-wise deep neural network based architecture to model the limited user behaviors within each session. To train the model efficiently, we first design a session embedding method to pre-train a session representation, which incorporates different kinds of user search behaviors such as clicks and views. Based on the learnt session representation, we further propose a list-wise ranking model to generate the recommendation result for each anonymous user session. We conduct quantitative experiments on a recently published dataset from an e-commerce company. The evaluation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can outperform the state-of-the-art.","inCitations":["b78566b11ee1bcfe5c437b5b0d4541abb27d5289","e291788bc51d7e8c51c6f4701dcd954a80dafe61","0c7e1338a9c7914a3b9a5bdc42b457b3f272160e","937206d21ac421e00ea7867bfe96fff7fa082d30"],"pmid":"","title":"Session-aware Information Embedding for E-commerce Product Recommendation","journalPages":"2379-2382","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05955","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05955v2.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133163"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Association rule learning","Boolean algebra","Deep learning","E-commerce payment system","E-services","Experiment","Long short-term memory","Recommender system"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["6a94f16627379a7163f39a5b909c41b5167d3889","091aded505b84cf87c197875ccfde24d98a300c9","0739fad62026ca36f101a36f29d53630207a5748","657fbf29ea0b4904a3e98d1556f9acf38dddae5f","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","2e635989e232816546ef352edc38881580b04c1e","043ae0ffa13c3b6b356a1d2a9859dcf2876388b3"],"id":"5d45c3d9bbc71586e161a76e2cca2687b7dc3d44","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5d45c3d9bbc71586e161a76e2cca2687b7dc3d44","authors":[{"name":"Chen Wu","ids":["49762500"]},{"name":"Ming Yan","ids":["47901868"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133163"}

Albeit effective, binary joins can drastically impact on the performance of query processing whenever source answers need to be passed through multiple operators in a query plan. Multi-way joins have been proposed to overcome this problem; they are able to propagate and generate results in a single step during query execution. We demonstrate the benefits of query plans with multi-way operators with BatWAn, a binary and multi-way query plan analyzer. Attendees will observe the behavior of multi-way joins on queries of different selectivity, as well as the impact on total execution time, time for the first answer, and continuous results yield over time.

Tracking dialogue states is an important ingredient in dialogue generation for estimating users' intention. However, the expensive nature of state labeling and the weak interpretability make the dialogue state tracking a challenging problem for both task-oriented and non-task-oriented dialogue generation: For generating responses in task-oriented dialogues, state tracking is usually learned from manually annotated corpora, where the human annotation is expensive for training; for generating responses in non-task-oriented dialogues, most of existing work neglects the explicit state tracking due to the unlimited number of dialogue states.\n In this paper, we propose the semi-supervised explicit dialogue state tracker (SEDST) for neural dialogue generation. To this end, our approach has two core ingredients: CopyFlowNet and posterior regularization. Specifically, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture, named CopyFlowNet, to represent an explicit dialogue state with a probabilistic distribution over the vocabulary space. To optimize the training procedure, we apply a posterior regularization strategy to integrate indirect supervision. Extensive experiments conducted on both task-oriented and non-task-oriented dialogue corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Moreover, we find that our proposed semi-supervised dialogue state tracker achieves a comparable performance as state-of-the-art supervised learning baselines in state tracking procedure.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Explicit State Tracking with Semi-Supervisionfor Neural Dialogue Generation","journalPages":"1403-1412","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.10596v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271683","http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10596"],"entities":["Encoder","Experiment","Matrix regularization","Reinforcement learning","Semi-supervised learning","Semiconductor industry","Supervised learning","Text corpus","Vocabulary"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ea414818831d2098e2876f465814564f9a5acabb","685752c0563023d40f96d34a1c6f9d042587a5d6","4685abbbefccf769cc09964c6956638a7bfcf132","1b9d8e45250717b9b5a62ae92ef18e3b77d59327","1c6a52aa3d0f0539e07fa82bbb04e5a431548202","519378b6ad4fb157b9af6251272b04e2cb50ece4","8a9ffa66aeae0f7596cce9db8f42919d863cff26","3e2529cf0a2b7bd744b3a820e0626b448f1e7836","2de0401b5f019fb8646a27a3cc50429b38693dd6","6ac1962fd1f2b90da02c63c16af39a3c7a3e6df6","36818eaf6376aeeaffed2523d28bebae7c9db8d7","f5c1a53daef462ce1120d64c13aa11ed88702547","34e46b00dcba29a9630ee47176750852007952c7","20690b7465e6fef5337f0c9be0a302d33b3c9b3a","bec3ded6a1a09353ccdded78ebb34fb8e43b149a","461a1fe84b2fb1698c9f4b416f09ec181cceafe2","8ff93cfd37dced279134c9d642337a2085b31f59","eb5f6ea7bbb7e06a4cd107544921979722bbd5ae","0fbc76d570d68e6bd3c9701c6fcb2efa91659eb3","aea427bcea46c83021e62f4fb10178557510ca5d","65b8fbe4ef37b30348dd592076ccd35b46dac29d","d2c99d525f5b227dbbbd65d499ace9011826e6e8","275fdaf79b8facffaeac26787b7d1d6a7c1fb53d","1c697a722f779176b5cd45b2415b2a378042a46b","84b520a8d6de79f62bb095b565d077e95bfb6f5b","17f5c7411eeeeedf25b0db99a9130aa353aee4ba","02463e0d580803dca65a48e7fb3d6f407d3d1512","8d8284bfba7ebcb4e2575d864ec7c16ea6a168f0","60744af2f89291897839852d66582b1b2a0be0bc","7effa438f586d1d97f9833f3ee8a44284fc614c2","02534853626c18c9a097c2712f1ddf3613257d35","9528fa09fbd918618dbd1bac72fe8c24f5574400","2020d23b1155398f77beb3169275f39646d17158","42ab3412e8a85c32929c2dbdc970c35df89bf5b3","255e97d82f528b613dbe8883727abfd14f3f9f39","986de5585b048d517a4a302d51e5771a4a05908b","268a7cd1bf65351bba4eb97aac373d624af2c08f","e722dd04fede7f024c0d0931fc353bfed39489ed","2d9e3f53fcdb548b0b3c4d4efb197f164fe0c381","0a22389bd99b7efe3627ec6fc77ddaf3ff5e2faa","17bef48a6075a9a57cc6e41378ad91396a85dfdb","9af9b29ae7e66d99507da23f805dd9306cea24e8","c69df48e17e1add15deebad44e727e7fcf91fc09","52e011e52d1a9e2c9ea12f31f5a2d3c1b459017e","0a6383b13794452fb7339a7f8a5384885186ccf6","5be0af9a01546e8534a3f674362eaf0c5c8c271a","388c8e6ba7646f46e499dffc00557cfe769a5dda","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","03bf8de9ee5a0e00942655e7a51f1142483fd82e","33411bfd9c6c396739a101a7ec672cafd0dc7346","5247a6e3a60ff0381355e66bfc313bf27512ae0c","85315b64a4c73cb86f156ef5b0a085d6ebc8a65d","01cdd092f7127c044eef4fa61cd387b34e92791b","d3476084d1a2efa31274d1e9d96946936f561ab0","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","00f31994c123fbceba5d5a0e06bb78aff651aae7"],"id":"0526880a24d7b087e487e4829ae568aff9b5a0f5","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0526880a24d7b087e487e4829ae568aff9b5a0f5","authors":[{"name":"Xisen Jin","ids":["51134926"]},{"name":"Wenqiang Lei","ids":["39165620"]},{"name":"Zhaochun Ren","ids":["2780667"]},{"name":"Hongshen Chen","ids":["2957953"]},{"name":"Shangsong Liang","ids":["3279808"]},{"name":"Yihong Zhao","ids":["8890429"]},{"name":"Dawei Yin","ids":["2115608"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271683"}

Specifically, we aim to build a model to infer distinct sets of (ontological) concepts describing complementary clinically salient aspects of the underlying trials: the populations enrolled, the interventions administered and the outcomes measured, i.e., the PICO elements. This important practical problem poses a few key challenges. One issue is that the output space is vast, because the vocabulary comprises many unique concepts. Compounding this problem, annotated data in this domain is expensive to collect and hence sparse. Furthermore, the outputs (sets of concepts for each PICO element) are correlated: specific populations (e.g., diabetics) will render certain intervention concepts likely (insulin therapy) while effectively precluding others (radiation therapy). Such correlations should be exploited. We propose a novel neural model that addresses these challenges. We introduce a Candidate-Selector architecture in which the model considers setes of candidate concepts for PICO elements, and assesses their plausibility conditioned on the input text to be annotated. This relies on a 'candidate set' generator, which may be learned or relies on heuristics. A conditional discriminative neural model then jointly selects candidate concepts, given the input text. We compare the predictive performance of our approach to strong baselines, and show that it outperforms them. Finally, we perform a qualitative evaluation of the generated annotations by asking domain experts to assess their quality.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"29308293v1","title":"A Neural Candidate-Selector Architecture for Automatic Structured Clinical Text Annotation","journalPages":"\n          1519-1528\n        ","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47199928"],"entities":["Addresses (publication format)","Annotation","Baseline (configuration management)","Cochrane Library","Condition number","Convolutional neural network","Heuristic (computer science)","Inference","JT (visualization format)","National Library of Medicine (U.S.)","Natural language processing","NetWare Loadable Module","Pico","Plausibility structure","Population","Roland GS","Sparse matrix","Triplet state","Unified Medical Language System","United States National Institutes of Health","Vocabulary"],"journalVolume":"2017","outCitations":["2538e3eb24d26f31482c479d95d2e26c0e79b990","af95a95febc76243b521b4559edf87670d513a7a","719754d472d8a506e58bbc61c16f7d79a0ba9ea4","591804251e15cfb571bc90c2fab2344f462e1617","1a1e6b61834e5ab0ec60a0be89b7e5a4b7160081","157099d6ffd3ffca8cfca7955aff7c5f1a979ac9","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","3efa84d6f4caf5ada3c9729061f266127f791b2f","523f045f102b9e7a91c18cfd11e8f1ab15c3b243","1fcaf7ddcadda724d67684d66856c107375f448b","0f2bba48586b8aaf25f4e8005cf27a2c740d85c3","aa6ee637e9f86148dadbc849983159ea24d2d204","28407386a4a9d5b6de2c906d4bb6245962cba300","e3e569a2868fedc4320a669e4838110994590ab9","1646ffbe4086944ef495004a5c07af1409641c52","4b7c8063892ca57131bd71b9c839d970ee8b0226","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","5a47681f16ab72882ca97b0c079974dbc9a54c98","01226d7b042bb91d10f5c9d0317e2531c1533e5a","589f8e0deb55179f5765945fe8d17e0d4ed565b9","58d005b486475fdd944ff622f0cc95dd8a8248e4","680c08076bddbd499e2e7ff8b1fd197723466532","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","39b6fc834b85cf181339474486873b4866959455","a87bc818f7409ac97c8719aa8fae2c40d214ebbc","3a982594d902ef89257cebedc7098a87afdc161d","35331328e0fe2987b5a9e90a86199c64a4e3dd4f","a4fba68413d64f48b4223c116cf57c4197bafb79","a8b5866e2a717bfc4186b7a93bddcf460957e6bd","6c8b30f63f265c32e26d999aa1fef5286b8308ad","23c6c94534378c204c0ee21fdaebd23fd4691bcf","0873f3a01be34df85ef0a8a214171c51c676a2a1","06b919f865d0a0c3adbc10b3c34cbfc35fb98d43"],"id":"f7e8c369f8869c23336ce3b39b2241e3b51f1ed1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f7e8c369f8869c23336ce3b39b2241e3b51f1ed1","authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Singh","ids":["4843370"]},{"name":"Iain James Marshall","ids":["1808775"]},{"name":"James Thomas","ids":["50512053"]},{"name":"John Shawe-Taylor","ids":["1792322"]},{"name":"Byron C.

There are two key processes in dynamic networks: network structural evolution and network temporal evolution, where the former represents interdependency between entities and their neighbors in the network at each timestamp, while the latter captures the evolving behavior of the entire network from the current timestamp to the next. Structural evolution generally assumes that a node is more likely to co-evolve with its neighbors in the near future. Temporal evolution focuses on the trend of network evolution as a whole, based on the accumulation of historical data. It is thus essential to use characteristics of both structural and temporal evolutions to emulate complex behaviors of dynamic networks. However, very few existing work considered both processes. In addition, real-life networks are often very sparse with limited observed links. A missing link between two nodes does not always imply that the two nodes do not have a relation in reality, especially when they share many common neighbors. Most existing methods only focus on the first-order proximity of networks, which is usually insufficient to capture the relationships among nodes. \n In this work, we propose a novel framework named STEP, to simultaneously integrate both structural and temporal information in link prediction in dynamic networks. STEP first constructs a sequence of higher-order proximity matrices to better capture the implicit relationships among nodes. A regularized optimization problem is then formulated to model those higher-order proximity matrices along with additional structural and temporal constraints. Given the large scale of modern networks, we also develop an efficient block coordinate gradient descent approach to solve the optimization problem efficiently. STEP can be used to solve the link prediction problem in directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted dynamic networks. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets demonstrate that STEP can effectively model link propagation over entire time-varying networks and its superiority over some state-of-the-art algorithms.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Exploiting Structural and Temporal Evolution in Dynamic Link Prediction","journalPages":"427-436","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271740"],"entities":["Algorithm","Bioinformatics","Cyber-physical system","Dynamic-link library","Entity","Evolution","Experiment","First-order predicate","Gradient descent","Graph (discrete mathematics)","IBM Notes","ISO 10303","Interdependence","List of Code Lyoko episodes","Mathematical optimization","Optimization problem","Protein structure prediction","Real life","Scalability","Social network","Software propagation","Sparse matrix","Time-varying network","Tree accumulation"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["ee742cdcec6fb80fda256c7202ffc3e7e2b34f4f","ce2fd2b302989be27095d4f988686fceab93c6a0","2e37d6b9a02ec31ea22252c37beae410c6b609a8","bcf48b5e76c7e22335c6820f0de0abe8c5f708b5","3f1f762b2b6750f2feb1ca2e021b2a3e798774a1","10ac4bc35c4fcdc09bebbd3b46e3a1223993b894","c90dd7731b01b3b486b5a28e1ce9bec547c9cfab","96544d4857777682129280b9d934d6ff2f221f40","5c58ad9a6c09782814a7d048bebd6ef1609c0fb4","4bc6ba5052654772c92c6007968964f64e4de1cc","f8a26c822984681075491ee6601a66e6675d0e63","1edd8d421dbd661281b823c3c873d8b445c82b5f","5ea4c598a154f6f0498d01a420bcca54285eb92f","5d3a0eba8e82853c28e315003e131811ebd18143","047699afd803d695f482277cbd6a10fef4b6c6c8","8a634a82681897822b14de28849c6548346206a0","c22bdeb25d1e217ee2927f689b0f3205181f1430","1f648792e09b175d97ff9348e5ecd1f806650038","39348c10c90be968357e2a6b65d5e0e479307735","04080a4fc2cb3316d63e9f6e8161873be21f6637","2d59ab3e29f99c25be24cdb5190d58fe2be7f855","34b116980f233735c345fc57dfe35fe97a7a2ca7","0d986240f345223dc542233074775d7f869a4013","c924797dad40d6a567fc3c8f12d403ce984a6193","c2fd72cb2a77941e655b5d949d0d59b01e173c3b","0d56addb8ed4888d976c34d8e0c287d8e5838545","315d843eef331a40ba422dc1f7aea4a7e14531a7","68151343db72713c87f646546d12c84306109643","0c8a049baf1e4d1f82a1b434fa70283733ac1688","0f8f6c2e8c41b835407ba4b07d48944252a41400","0710099aee18aabc0605c52628c29ac5ad94ec60","98e3766f786dfb3982733a95aa7b1e142e7612b0","1a67622ca58aa851afe36ad6c6e78f9fb9d691d2","37b269a8c86b75d3b19c8390548c678d9f102d15","2d896f30d9412161e330dcbe013ea1faa059fa02"],"id":"33841403bb8676b462a30707754fac09b312165f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/33841403bb8676b462a30707754fac09b312165f","authors":[{"name":"Huiyuan Chen","ids":["4760974"]},{"name":"Jing Li","ids":["1723081"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271740"}

Specific instances make use of signals ranging from user feedback, item relationships, geographic locality, social influence (etc.). Typically, research proceeds by showing that making use of a specific signal (within a carefully designed model) allows for higher-fidelity recommendations on a particular dataset. Of course, the real situation is more nuanced, in which a combination of many signals may be at play, or favored in different proportion by individual users. Here we seek to develop a framework that is capable of combining such heterogeneous item relationships by simultaneously modeling (a) what modality of recommendation is a user likely to be susceptible to at a particular point in time; and (b) what is the best recommendation from each modality. Our method borrows ideas from mixtures-of-experts approaches as well as knowledge graph embeddings. We find that our approach naturally yields more accurate recommendations than alternatives, while also providing intuitive 'explanations' behind the recommendations it provides.","inCitations":["3e45ff12f098291d0fec1184eac4f24b32172126"],"pmid":"","title":"Recommendation Through Mixtures of Heterogeneous Item Relationships","journalPages":"1143-1152","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.10031v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271792","http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/cikm18b.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10031"],"entities":["Emoticon","General-purpose modeling","Interaction","Knowledge Graph","Locality of reference","Modality (human\u2013computer interaction)","Multi-task learning","Personalization","Recommender system"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a483c62f661f57a883c06daa6ac25b7f80cad661","118a0278dc3e0a653c3cf19b132c44632d7a1e13","081ad92ce0e71541646218f11061c86414a960c2","a52d6f43e43e0b83335202748171304ef2fc8118","00cbb42367566a70e3c541d93b5873565b9b1288","10e1fb949e10d5fe99d5f1b32bb48d625149bce8","0afdd579811abb161468da0ede6e622dd4222311","6a08a92f1d990f89e87aec2af243227984b98980","d0caf22825647365a86ae4bf8749cfbe48789a8c","0c0ff60e9d39c203929457d1ac3f840f8c8e9619","2bb2ba7c96d40e269fc6a2d5384c739ff9fa16eb","1c2cae04e0e00dcec3fe6840b2daa00ae9e8a0a3","2cbe0ba73d02aabbeefedf841203219796a551b7","b93a14feca57295a13dfc0a8da0a1a9c87b5b520","d5a823053663a77869d4b38a8026c51ebc2e975e","e25221b4c472c4337383341f6b2c9375e86709af","6a94f16627379a7163f39a5b909c41b5167d3889","75a927501749c2cbc0e19a58f798f04de59df64a","9e91c370a8fae365c731947ad9178fb3788f6593","3605b9befd5f1b53019b8edb3b3d227901e76c89","a5203a54528b4ff60c6d1078087e82829b39e365","3e45ff12f098291d0fec1184eac4f24b32172126","3e996ae4e9575300dbaffe44ea51c90d5b691f72","1ae4ca92fd869195725ebbeb1e8b2ee94b88e593","cce60519321884c2722f590c459f92551915563e","629781b0d1cb7d7589b45dc4937ae59ad591ce72","c20fce1384e8569cb15ab40dd09e36b1088a14d0","2275762a28582716db92df6d525ed2481c7d7f14","68f0901176ab82b29eb79276b74cb4bf601e196e","236c4613771834d3cfb43c450305ade107813198","6c02053805434162e0fed26e1d5e035eb1071249","55905e637d4c06cd16e331ac9417d93d896472fd","36cb4ed29f9f0b6ea37343b3d98154293a374ec2","8451c2812a1476d3e13f2a509139322cc0adb1a2","18fb605aff0296c2bc7515fdc258a634e53a3024","184b7281a87ee16228b24716ca02b29519d52eb5","01226d7b042bb91d10f5c9d0317e2531c1533e5a","23b0a959d07a744a80734119e94262f14f2d83e1","272216c1f097706721096669d85b2843c23fa77d","994afdf0db0cb0456f4f76468380822c2f532726","4672f24bf1828452dc367669ab8a29f79834ad58","04b52c8230c3f9f4f4032b06458069d81c8f07b2","ef79912287a8d40dc56e9f72150dced664c8e9df","d7205a5ecd9a3555a5eee5e31079451d965cc999","777173c65bdb36bb1768074df56917a06022f59f","49d0d09cfaed3a4ffd460c224aecb5e78ff32638"],"id":"fb698241a9a6dec0ddd3e0bf85485ee0e31cbb6a","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fb698241a9a6dec0ddd3e0bf85485ee0e31cbb6a","authors":[{"name":"Wang-Cheng Kang","ids":["2741053"]},{"name":"Mengting Wan","ids":["2127553"]},{"name":"Julian McAuley","ids":["1814008"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271792"}

However, as many stories break on social channels first before being picked up by mainstream media, developing methods to better handle social content is of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose a robust and effective approach to automatically identify microposts related to a specific topic defined by a small sample of reference documents. Our framework extracts clusters of semantically similar microposts that overlap with the reference documents, by extracting combinations of key features that define those clusters through frequent pattern mining. This allows us to construct compact and interpretable representations of the topic, dramatically decreasing the computational burden compared to classical clustering and k-NN-based machine learning techniques and producing highly-competitive results even with small training sets (less than 1'000 training objects). Our method is efficient and scales gracefully with large sets of incoming microposts. We experimentally validate our approach on a large corpus of over 60M microposts, showing that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.","inCitations":["7c2b0395f0b2cdc67ec3fb5693176da2b5b5a12b","9af9b29ae7e66d99507da23f805dd9306cea24e8"],"pmid":"","title":"Efficient Document Filtering Using Vector Space Topic Expansion and Pattern-Mining: The Case of Event Detection in Microposts","journalPages":"457-466","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133016"],"entities":["Analysis of algorithms","Baseline (configuration management)","Cluster analysis","Computation","Data mining","Emergence","Experiment","Grams","K-nearest neighbors algorithm","Machine learning","N-gram","PA-RISC","Parsing","Real-time clock","Social media","Synonym ring","Text corpus","Velocity (software development)","Wikipedia","Word embedding","WordNet"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1be73f2bbd9abf77b52d7c0c7d954bcc237eeffa","c757be6651bebee423a82554418bef55d9a54c7f","ecdecb0a4408d7c332f11f54a79b524e78b55232","755b5fe168b1f3ed51c01841d1542a980461856c","0c67c80eaf6d36c0ef2048dad3c63d1e94c4d553","b3625e35fe7de551d628dd4b3875d2ba847f1097","0112e8af2499667230b0c961594f8fe2af0a4203","7806d4087e7a7da6eb00cdbd3b55763718446a28","0f7f1b3b7b8660ca2cb04a8890ae921326fd0edb","8bd9c3c6b34b62bde7619d0a1e3e98f9eb1a33ee","4c995f7708d82bac4018628faec9305e6f7c13dc","c5c132623ddd90ec4efdefe946133cc2c8169002","2ed164a624809c4dc339f973a7e12c8dc847da47","1048e55e9686710d77b6b3a3a7fd5be7d3525994","f593775413880d4e57725857408ba8e03070be19","0a6383b13794452fb7339a7f8a5384885186ccf6","aed38235ba619304a8c4fb8ee56633901247be46","7687a755350038675f0a663e7ff5e7a8f6274bdb","21e09fd735e5e45567a1c1b1b1a4a557e1e38870","56d53a048c17d044308368376320b15f69d09f42","6ba401b333ed4ed97c78863929533acdecd1133c","48e37374ebff3f99434ba373be6e923b9b948dd3","99388a0d3beb526a13421ed088743b30a75e2b29","0094d3d199e7b5234e7115b218ac076441df1359","551de9b970f9a78bb0c486936a9766e0e55a77ae","a57baa6177ddd6055f6f9c5fe9105be61535feef","852425cc7886997e59e41936619937b203ff781c","2871f115e7a11c903258491c75d4171fac679344","505bf56dcd0b8884b6127a2c5c43206f4bc87f3d","bc96a775dd7a9ad795265ab942e8cac1340fc3c4","2ef615cf8e9fbd22fba584a8e18432fe209cf4ec","4995fbc1375cd608ebecf982eabe7aeb3ec913c5","4828bd76b969360e96fd52e55959b9157500943c","01e0b215b190f2df531d78e0ee67e9182cc90261","49b2a1b9606c0ccb95a36895760fc91b8b830266","214655b618d7d9cb381be592deafc6e426fcef47"],"id":"478e12a431ae47145013065e1ba624883511260e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/478e12a431ae47145013065e1ba624883511260e","authors":[{"name":"Julia Proskurnia","ids":["3461305"]},{"name":"Ruslan Mavlyutov","ids":["2056584"]},{"name":"Carlos Castillo","ids":["1785067"]},{"name":"Karl Aberer","ids":["1751802"]},{"name":"Philippe Cudré-Mauroux","ids":["1680925"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133016"}

To help people quickly digest the explosive information, we define a new problem - schema-based news event profiling - profiling events reported in open-domain news corpora, with a set of slots and slot-value pairs for each event, where the set of slots forms the schema of an event type. Such profiling not only provides readers with concise views of events, but also facilitates various applications such as information retrieval, knowledge graph construction and question answering. It is however a quite challenging task. The first challenge is to find out events and event types because they are both initially unknown. The second difficulty is the lack of pre-defined event-type schemas. Lastly, even with the schemas extracted, to generate event profiles from them is still essential yet demanding.\n To address these challenges, we propose a fully automatic, unsupervised, three-step framework to obtain event profiles. First, we develop a Bayesian non-parametric model to detect events and event types by exploiting the slot expressions of the entities mentioned in news articles. Second, we propose an unsupervised embedding model for schema induction that encodes the insight: an entity may serve as the values of multiple slots in an event, but if it appears in more sentences along with the same set of more entities in the event, its slots in these sentences tend to be similar. Finally, we build event profiles by extracting slot values for each event based on the slots' expression patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on schema-based profiling for news events. Experimental results on a large news corpus demonstrate the superior performance of our method against the state-of-the-art baselines on event detection, schema induction and event profiling.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Open-Schema Event Profiling for Massive News Corpora","journalPages":"587-596","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271674","http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/cikm18_qyuan.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Backward induction","Baseline (configuration management)","Big data","Cryptographic hash function","Data redundancy","Database schema","Entity","Entity\u2013attribute\u2013value model","Expression (computer science)","Information retrieval","Internet Information Services","Knowledge Graph","Parametric model","Question answering","S-expression","Source-to-source compiler","Text corpus","Unsupervised learning","XML schema"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["882b5750af428257c4fd7d79e3034ee51d92b381","2c1f12b287338f6ef206c46e134c427c16427192","338d005c9264a0feca773d0881a7731e781f0f59","0f238588114dea88a3eeefe9186427436fe377e9","3d378bdbf3564e341bec66c1974899b01e82507f","6bbe54276e5c38fbe6941da73baed0941cb1b429","1407b3363d9bd817b00e95190a95372d3cb3694a","e17a4ce03444b4cf8b11122ff980b6f2e3ec9b8e","1efd95ba1fd856546fbe886412a2d6921eea7261","b9e0d839a2b04be6f32d8fb2f3a02822e48aaaad","608eb7045f77868a1e219ef5fdf6d13d67d6ed3f","2154e7af8cbfbe2e91e79800807c10391e8e378d","e85a71c8cae795a1b2052a697d5e8182cc8c0655","0522fe54873bfccc71a2ed83caf0cbaacc63603f","a477778d8ae4cb70b67d02d094d030c44d0c6ffd","91e4ba886ce779a6e80a3292ed70c5386c5e86d6","19c1291578753bcce570dd107d106e468605b311","56e0ec93d19c4e2796533ce1050c8639d45c40eb","3a9b136ca1ab91592df36f148ef16095f74d009e","0ce17d4d41b1291e942ec3bf6c102f3ae3034b3d","6316041aa75e8e5b481ec43814946f4fe1a580a7","01a7995cf0b1c89ec6322cc2b734f70e6b18e222","acec622ca4fb7e01a56116522d35ded149969d0a","498bb0efad6ec15dd09d941fb309aa18d6df9f5f","a7e95b5aeeeba3d5455b98b6f7ae84f4e9a72842","4b3f3a688352b4551208ace3c573584a7b8e5377","49b2a1b9606c0ccb95a36895760fc91b8b830266","34329c7ec1cc159ed5efa84cb38ea9bbec335d19","cd9551270d8fa0ed7752cace5619dc4af5d60ea4","84364e5660d0db7fe4654febb1e8aba0399835b5","facef9d98129c394beb5de4e0a6a144e602b492d","0834e74304b547c9354b6d7da6fa78ef47a48fa8","0f1a4aaf6d35b25b35f3e47c83d6e363f8ce1e09","30d42515df2900edce9b386ea17e4a4e2584fd4c","047d078f6cfed4cc067643b5e15f4e8f65a97c0b","458a20aaad8c76355d26737789beb23e8004edd2","44550820f0ad5bcd26569444e0e3420696fa1320","014ff1eac046518a57ba2f1a75b1aa50579cc594","4c38534dcd8ff4ab0c054bba8408078284162d69","405c51da20ff107771b3fef00d71c8af28a88d7b","4b0983f8864f0599c93b1168aefd443877ea1bca","0542b5458de3efad67d77af573c60a73b7da0fbd","80676b9c23d161fd1d6da43936d8393502eca6af","6723dda58e5e09089ec78ba42827b65859f030e2","4d76072a133a39144b5fe4b16611b603b641d487","bd2f9c2aaca9772c44e05f8eb86914edea72cdc6","07fe26f10ab2eb7ba7ad7df5096813c949dcabc9","29d9ec7e0763c8f2fd5f88c40223fe4838b7e802","0a29034dfb45914bf0642012d7b860b071425bed","1dd3fbb3c6c5e7dfe8f52f3f34d238b9434511b5","72a3efcd92ecbba28ed68e537a86605f57535b3f","8756cbfe7069b89826843a13f9867d5f81189e5f","706c3cda33c9f36a9f1e7542c32c044d02fbaf6a","544a0fa1107df1423db05070182f213053003040","45c56dc268a04c5fc7ca04d7edb985caf2a25093","0796f6cd7f0403a854d67d525e9b32af3b277331","86d401b968e8590626d96919cd69887df850f86a","1dc841887e26e868bb367a4b67f83f36938a80f9","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","823262c42414bfaba9a0cea736e1c77c7cea7837","e876c9b27f6083b1a1fa38255e815be79ba1e1dd","f98ebc10ce8c48020d21cca041de2a3346ce31d9","0a9a7912ff46b944a6a4156754271933b828f01b","14e8581100bb3a6e4d71caa906e7bbcec569db3f","2b4dd276f4a8c1b0ba2670331364f7b4885322b9"],"id":"550722916b99c662ddd063706a053d6e5be34fd3","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/550722916b99c662ddd063706a053d6e5be34fd3","authors":[{"name":"Quan Yuan","ids":["34284012"]},{"name":"Xiang Ren","ids":["3095428"]},{"name":"Wenqi He","ids":["50101880"]},{"name":"Chao Zhang","ids":["1720735"]},{"name":"Xinhe Geng","ids":["8816887"]},{"name":"Lifu Huang","ids":["34170717"]},{"name":"Heng Ji","ids":["1739737"]},{"name":"Chin-Yew Lin","ids":["1781574"]},{"name":"Jiawei Han","ids":["1722175"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271674"}

Typically, there are two main challenges to face when tackling this problem: first, the class of relevant objects has often low prevalence and, secondly, this class can be multifaceted or multi-modal: objects could be relevant for completely different reasons. To solve this problem and its associated issues, we propose an approach based on a non-stationary (aka restless) extension of Thompson Sampling, a well-known strategy for Multi-Armed Bandits problems. The collection is first soft-clustered into a finite set of components and a posterior distribution of getting a relevant object inside each cluster is updated after receiving the user feedback about the proposed instances. The\u201cnext instance\u201d selection strategy is a mixed, two-level decision process, where both the soft clusters and their instances are considered. This method can be considered as an insurance, where the cost of the insurance is an extra exploration effort in the short run, for achieving a nearly \u201ctotal\u201d recall with less efforts in the long run.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Active Search for High Recall: a Non-Stationary Extension of Thompson Sampling","journalPages":"722-728","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3ecb/50b1e270634c7b5a181b77511f2bd44cd6b5.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_68","http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09550","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09550v2.pdf"],"entities":["Cluster analysis","Faceted classification","Feature vector","Mechatronics","Modal logic","Sampling (signal processing)","Search problem","Stationary process","Thompson sampling"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["cae62c08d334366d7ef3fedd400ed8e1cf0515be","d857f3c10634e1aaf2c59d7e506527f33d519f07","c3060708bc9d64279a643af6f5bccceeed7158a1","9f39d53abb641060e617e0964b0d2766a578e887","9dc68675f5bc23e51df8390ba6ceef8facd97b2d","afd04c544271aa07f97b003455ccc8a3133f004a","554c8784475ce293fc9cdbee1d8e465d8c4d5a15","577542a0017657546c9d6f5e7c983306c54f7662","155a2f07fceafcc8ab95c0d680a078ba6510a22a"],"id":"2245c4c3a805194bd692795e6f9a983c0bb9954f","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2245c4c3a805194bd692795e6f9a983c0bb9954f","authors":[{"name":"Jean-Michel Renders","ids":["2822140"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_68"}

Because it provides the spatio-temporal changes of the power grid in a particular location, ENF is used in many application domains including the prediction of grid instability and blackouts, detection of system breakup, and even digital forensics. In order to build high performing applications and systems, it is necessary to capture a large-scale nationwide or worldwide ENF map. Consequently, many studies have been conducted on the distribution of specialized physical devices that capture the ENF signals. However, this approach is not practical because it requires significant effort from design to setup, moreover, it has a limitation in its efficiency to monitor and stably retain the collection equipment distributed throughout the world. Furthermore, this approach requires a significant budget.\n In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to constructing the worldwide ENF map by analyzing streaming data obtained by online multimedia services, such as \"Youtube\", \"Earthcam\", and \"Ustream\" instead of expensive specialized hardware. However, extracting accurate ENF from the streaming data is not a straightforward process because multimedia has its own noise and uncertainty. By applying several signal processing techniques, we can reduce noise and uncertainty, and improve the quality of the restored ENF.\n For the evaluation of this process, we compared the performance between the ENF signals restored by our proposed approach and collected by the frequency disturbance recorder (FDR) from FNET/GridEye. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms in stable acquisition and management of the ENF signals compared to the conventional approach.","inCitations":["3c64af9de041e4da43d25e925cb262dd83e98fd2"],"pmid":"","title":"Construction of a National Scale ENF Map using Online Multimedia Data","journalPages":"19-28","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132982"],"entities":["Algorithm","EarthCam","Image noise","Instability","Sensor","Signal processing","Streaming media","Warez"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0e53919eb04c4f6c9d56b965e17464c90b74fa18","4845d36059a300fde501dbb0ae925cda0ee9f2d5","4fbbc7f905b16408c80b19bd64c0707eba379dcd","fc5025f3dcb3d21cae35150fe12c1a8c8f75c6df","922987537c5236521413a45471d8fcea9da91e49","8448355a48b5de0f6f8e89df86603ae1e919a28b","226c22de32151b7e7bbd9e7d7386305624cceb00","173426361cfa58d4eaca96fb1f8c90b49c74ec21","bbfc134a76f60447f2f777a094b247599121fa23","567710992d6e186c9bf0f3c4720ce43106436f12","d5769a46e57fd3164846fc9eed4f6d67eff8ccd1","63ccb05e42ab9a3561c8c1bf2b0609ba53b10e9e","b41a53dffb41e4a0a6eaefa646ba267842edd457","c2bbdc14a77e43d10b5d2cb6492129b448ff81b0"],"id":"53424fcd3fa1cfea66cea14dfd411393f0acfecd","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/53424fcd3fa1cfea66cea14dfd411393f0acfecd","authors":[{"name":"Hyunsoo Kim","ids":["39280603"]},{"name":"Young Bae Jeon","ids":["5968531"]},{"name":"Ji Won Yoon","ids":["3185613"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132982"}

Our theoretical analysis provides the best asymptotic upper bound on the running time of our algorithm for the case when the input graph is sparse. Our experimental evaluation on large real-world graphs shows that our parallel algorithm is faster than state-of-the-art algorithms, while boasting an excellent degree of parallelism. In particular, we are able to list all k-cliques (for any k) in graphs containing up to tens of millions of edges as well as all 10-cliques in graphs containing billions of edges, within a few minutes and a few hours respectively. Finally, we show how our algorithm can be employed as an effective subroutine for finding the k-clique core decomposition and an approximate k-clique densest subgraphs in very large real-world graphs.","inCitations":["8d54e1707374f0c20ad2c573a585661ae60dd7cf","7293653683628fcf3771b83b82815634258af80a","c50d92c5954b6bf01c31c527279aeaeef449f93e"],"pmid":"","title":"Listing k-cliques in Sparse Real-World Graphs","journalPages":"589-598","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/feee/ce1276e3ff6abedd286747a2ebe5de7619c8.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186125","http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~obalalau/pdf/kcliques.pdf"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Automatic parallelization","Clique (graph theory)","Computer data storage","Data mining","Degree of parallelism","Experiment","Parallel algorithm","Parallel computing","Sparse matrix","Subroutine","Time complexity"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["948c7653f1bada9ce67eb76300cfb4f79604df12","04fe2b1ba2cf79caef3ad683bc8b05d46be8bd71","3f00b1360b7be9605022137d16c98458225c92c1","404ae4a2b31d5c2184861cf702f953e47db40cab","ff8c2bfe566808be9029c719c7b4cd37d6249d39","110b55a017f52abfedca220036ea129d84b7cadc","2949753957a4a5fb717dd86486da7e8eb1c7e79d","a2f399ff1e3eb74cd813c8beb87816fced0af759","cbce38ea34c90b8a53f35f10b2235e65fc5fe167","7c1a0f7054d496e71cc697202b84d8a5c652328a","215e99b4f85c57d649eb6a3f8b9ccc7cb1014489","00673496dd1efdacce581d64238feca0c2a410d7","55dd000972f212827f755ba69930b9a0c2c3d494","7a03e14cb1beecccbc030391703224d7beb62e94","41cc7331334c8ffa7a7b5e3d3b8a338a897f7af8","2b5c8b0848dc6ec0593a8ee1a293c80848253519","883b535b81b7a7dd17725e1820da3c17d8b4019d","00d89b389f112e6f4375b83b3c26acdd201717bf","16e360c88b3b158171331abeb055d51898e9481c","89f28f52b14fed8dd811341a808bad4b570d4558","0e8e7455ce92703e4dd5413f68582a70be49b91b","9f3583769b9226c59ca2469f230d2db0d6499647","4e6f8182de9dd04f1fe4f07425964ccf063a79bd","3dcb00b96d3568ce03a6335540681e19fc446ee0","0eaf38cd3d7c7fb456201d59b6d28b084010d358","579dee286a6cbec4ede3e1fd11dab8c4498ab4aa","231efcdb61b4c070c40049c32ceaea929ac13c14","372d304735a19907a5fbe6540d2c9133e7b6af8c","ef5830173af38a8fa8a369dcf96756ea97e7280e","00273ef0af172a8ae02c59bf49a9b09c22cc68fa","0e1809aea71fcf3c19ab4257aa0150f5a7e51350","384474a40381241d60b3728279e1212b68dc0e39","10609eeb5350a6cba45c69f3aa42a1ea10291ff7","fdfcc9f288dcbc23f5b59f42909c215ea7e0d199","b503111efb0560aaea70e950a6928116df2862a7","7805de482edfbec3a736bb6b3d1bb5163435752d","0abc9eacf942396f4664e83fd84deb0e82983efd","a6837071fc77bcdf591354b5037fa33f8db9756f","ad1ca5e5a7d4ff063e85d5588830709a359505e0","b117e3ab62ce5a405428bd3b9f76afd1293e0c85","7fc0634b2fb092c723210f2fec175ea6c4935f6e","02a217288f7ea7ca3f9db1e6d645dabeee78f673","0cf0c343ae17b0db4b5564b22480aa0415ef61af","0706356c9ab6014d6b04577d38289ea8328291a5","b8d99088d0827f147efda85a54cf36aa02c036e0","56ca4d9202232688942892685e1c7218d05ee020","6e99e31a250bd6147f78b5fb2568c6cdc332b3b6"],"id":"feeece1276e3ff6abedd286747a2ebe5de7619c8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/feeece1276e3ff6abedd286747a2ebe5de7619c8","authors":[{"name":"Maximilien Danisch","ids":["2444492"]},{"name":"Oana Denisa Balalau","ids":["1908403"]},{"name":"Mauro Sozio","ids":["1816033"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3178876.3186125"}

Cognitive performance varies throughout each day and is in part driven by intrinsic, near 24-hour circadian rhythms. Prior research on the impact of sleep and circadian rhythms on cognitive performance has typically been restricted to small-scale laboratory-based studies that do not capture the variability of real-world conditions, such as environmental factors, motivation, and sleep patterns in real-world settings. Given these limitations, leading sleep researchers have called for larger in situ monitoring of sleep and performance [39]. We present the largest study to date on the impact of objectively measured real-world sleep on performance enabled through a reframing of everyday interactions with a web search engine as a series of performance tasks. Our analysis includes 3 million nights of sleep and 75 million interaction tasks. We measure cognitive performance through the speed of keystroke and click interactions on a web search engine and correlate them to wearable device-defined sleep measures over time. We demonstrate that real-world performance varies throughout the day and is influenced by both circadian rhythms, chronotype (morning/evening preference), and prior sleep duration and timing. We develop a statistical model that operationalizes a large body of work on sleep and performance and demonstrates that our estimates of circadian rhythms, homeostatic sleep drive, and sleep inertia align with expectations from laboratory-based sleep studies. Further, we quantify the impact of insufficient sleep on real-world performance and show that two consecutive nights with less than six hours of sleep are associated with decreases in performance which last for a period of six days. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using online interactions for large-scale physiological sensing.","inCitations":["82f48119b76b524b0cbc73cfa264cc09b92725dd","5439f33d3f73ac5b207b1c42e66aa33309022db9","00fc5881bebd77092c72156253ddf04de5ede082","b6f5c62b360de851a32aa613a1f2a18770f4a6ba","64faf598555feed35b7147bff5c51ac6904d129c","30fbc13ab546efd0af01621dcfc28e191a32a7e8","dcc2af6735a52f6360d6abcec836d3bed28968ee","138c330c32ad9055b584c8a256cc1f6213dce1f2","aaab3571a1940a2f593f3a3922e1ec1afdfdb2f0","35adc17fec5f0bc5fdab254b952a504a6246d5e4","e7e49114ba184a3f3c57c0dd7b07b3d1fac66dfd","490fd3e8259e93d15c289e3f806c2bc93456df15","3e933480649b76f77876f0ae985dab7e5e134592","226146b6e35cbd16a653ed00cab4b0fa8c70e564","142b22825fb7592c6806a48e6b9f5fd45d85ec9d","c07b2b4f9352164bbdc268b9c4cdc64257f5f721","f1787126f295b33e156cd1aa46c33584403ff87c"],"pmid":"","title":"Harnessing the Web for Population-Scale Physiological Sensing: A Case Study of Sleep and Performance","journalPages":"113-122","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a6d2/0f32c8b2ba25bff0d7a45548ec11c93495d6.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sleep_and_Performance_Paper_WWW17.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07083v1.pdf","http://erichorvitz.com/Population_scale_physiology.pdf","http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p113.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07083","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052637","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07083v2.pdf","http://ryenwhite.com/papers/AlthoffWWW2017.pdf","http://timalthoff.de/docs/althoff-2017-population_scale_physiological_sensing.pdf"],"entities":["24-hour clock","Align (company)","Event (computing)","Homeostasis","Interaction","Six Days in Fallujah","Spatial variability","Statistical model","Wearable technology","Web search engine","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["5b02d46e0a375bea277003d9bb1e4add6e00f57a","087846516fdf387d6ec07a59f477e43d9f853e56","890e0b021b7445a08b7f60818e4bd3ea4fb9017a","d0875a52e332e716ca84d60d44954c1d9b4f6143","c50f7cbee84165da599226636186acc1f3bd5d1d","6bf16840567340c6ea54359748511acc5b16f32d","6ceea206dc9267145ce23da8f936fa5911c479d1","82f8fbc66004ac438ac742c1ad6016d07d1ae037","129d75bbcfb5da706adbdd90ce87262e99e537a2","8169a5c4f4defab1e3964e46e6c8e90847eba3bc","8bebf482d762da30d15cce9a621bbe4bbda09a3b","1891e011d27b2b05d7e4598838a972108e5a9140","3c7581a3cfe802e797a186b8f532a6c4d7ecd0eb","d00d305002171374e8a1ce865520af1ebe214891","557ccb7258b7c8f1f0d2988ffd04a4742c382d55","255e02a01beec38d26a72bf443603fdb6438582a","35adc17fec5f0bc5fdab254b952a504a6246d5e4","ff5c3b48e4a2c46de00839c86b3322735d42a907","366862ca872ad9ddba0183d922be385b0ed0df1e","9932d1a0aaca0fd1c13718a69478ae1988d132c8","8e924fe4d15c69c40f0918404087987727dc77a5","3d837e39b17d2e23d742bb20dfb909dabf865c3d","30fe4e09486fc06378d82b92afc8641d515c12ce","900b2bb8a2990d7042cfde23c2bcf68760b264e4","706f7294d50bb6ca20c2567bba192e62803696a8","c31977bacba3031b682f3068a86420e8031bad2c","f2cf75b154e6ce9d48c0b801530e731e3690f1c7","cf0a58424e0314470768376e1a7bbffff6855cd9","082b04149c29d90cf34ad9c1e2f1bd531240975a","541ca008258aa8e3b49bb0892cd1054a8e62ee92","2afd645e3ea20fac3062e7529d1df181f69565ef","3c44bbb7e3dc8be94766a6b1c8596a246106f24d","05d63702a8034f2bce76a2db4ddeb94be87f0009","429ea73c6273b017f869fb65c1e4f5d3cea188f3","5f2be8b48e1931ed8f67c0f138d137f5e4bb6aac","c03b02e4f2a22bfc3c4ac48c8c2aa82253528cbc","6b4156cdaeb030bb4e2ed81596684856185643e8","74a10ba42ba07355f4170680f4c9c3f4c0cd8d71","9d1570cd8017a9816df6171c97cfbc8e79815d1a","2a6e90ac72115fe697f954d173a1557a066e4ab1"],"id":"069313181e7cd7c76cc6f0254fb03b7d119bfff2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/069313181e7cd7c76cc6f0254fb03b7d119bfff2","authors":[{"name":"Tim Althoff","ids":["1745524"]},{"name":"Eric Horvitz","ids":["1688884"]},{"name":"Ryen W.

Researchers often need to study a promising paper in depth to keep up with the forefront of technology. Traditional Query-Oriented study method is time-consuming and even tedious. For a given paper, existent academic search engines like Google Scholar tend to recommend relevant papers, failing to reveal the knowledge structure. The state-of-the-art MapOriented study methods such as AMiner and AceMap can structure scholar information, but they\u2019re too coarse-grained to dig into the underlying principles of a specific paper. To address this problem, we propose a Study-Map Oriented method and a novel model called RIDP (Reference Injection based Double-Damping PageRank) to help researchers study a given paper more efficiently and thoroughly. RIDP integrates newly designed Reference Injection based Topic Analysis method and Double-Damping PageRank algorithm to mine a Study Map out of massive academic papers in order to guide researchers to dig into the underlying principles of a specific paper. Experiment results on real datasets and pilot user studies indicate that our method can help researchers acquire knowledge more efficiently, and grasp knowledge structure systematically.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"From Citation Network to Study Map: A Novel Model to Reorganize Academic Literatures","journalPages":"1225-1232","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c43/712eb0b7d0eebe3c830800fc3ac4047a9dc0.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/companion/p1225.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3041021.3053059"],"entities":["Academic Search","Algorithm","Citation network","Failure","Google Scholar","List of academic databases and search engines","Microsoft Forefront","PageRank","Usability testing","Web search engine"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["14275fe27f4a96e449ae2c9e0911d616c38b9276","322293bb0bbd47349c5fd605dce5c63f03efb6a8","1723c2dab448688b55a6e8fdf78d8fadee871160","0a71179f64a3c93e63020b2c5ae5da702e328b02","3aed29136db8f1e5c6a89fc22d3ae4b4926a3555","d5641d684df3a9e7c357923d109421fe4304ffa8","24281c886cd9339fe2fc5881faf5ed72b731a03e","0541d5338adc48276b3b8cd3a141d799e2d40150","eb82d3035849cd23578096462ba419b53198a556","1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","58a63086b209374d5cf625d27617eba1e96288ef","7698edc7311d0171c8c8fff9bc22cec6a65c48ea","31f27864950a6c417cf996927b2d5558f70d2b14","009dbf3187862352aac542bf7d61e27bce6b27f5","92eb167f30ad59f6949667021760eb41078cf85c","dc60ce6eb9ace1dd9ec9daa26a0bb456532ce0b3","13a7c351d1c9d46253ea30c78cb6f3715385023e","e84db67a900903ccfa977e03ca69df6a409e6123","a586e9b8b1834723ad8620318ded7b0d76b1effe"],"id":"7c43712eb0b7d0eebe3c830800fc3ac4047a9dc0","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7c43712eb0b7d0eebe3c830800fc3ac4047a9dc0","authors":[{"name":"Shibo Tao","ids":["2203978"]},{"name":"Xiaorong Wang","ids":["8415343"]},{"name":"Weijing Huang","ids":["1682021"]},{"name":"Wei Chen","ids":["50504074"]},{"name":"Tengjiao Wang","ids":["33455006"]},{"name":"Kai Lei","ids":["1784737"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3041021.3053059"}

However, since the third party may not be honest, privacy poses a major concern. In this paper, we address this concern with a two-stage privacy-preserving scheme called RG-RP: the first stage is designed to mitigate maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation attacks by perturbing each participant's data through a nonlinear function called repeated Gompertz (RG); while the second stage aims to maintain accuracy and reduce transmission energy by projecting high-dimensional data to a lower dimension, using a row-orthogonal random projection (RP) matrix. The proposed RG-RP scheme delivers better recovery resistance to MAP estimation attacks than most state-of-the-art techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets. For collaborative learning, we proposed a novel LSTM-CNN model combining the merits of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our experiments on two representative movement datasets captured by wearable sensors demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-CNN model outperforms standalone LSTM, CNN and Deep Belief Network. Together, RG+RP and LSTM-CNN provide a privacy-preserving collaborative learning framework that is both accurate and privacy-preserving.","inCitations":["0447ada31aaf20300680a91dc9629914b6df8f72","d9df16c024d124a5e3fc2ba4f2c1d564d280c2e6","eb3eee38ba40c711b8b41f4d31eef7ed003fafd9"],"pmid":"","title":"Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Deep Learning with Application to Human Activity Recognition","journalPages":"1219-1228","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3132847.3132990"],"entities":["Activity recognition","Convolutional neural network","Crowdsensing","Deep belief network","Deep learning","Emergence","Experiment","Gompertz function","Independent component analysis","Internet of things","Long short-term memory","Modified Huffman coding","Multi-user","Nonlinear system","Portable Document Format","Privacy","RP (complexity)","Random projection","Residential gateway","Sensor","Server (computing)","Server-side","Smart environment","Synthetic intelligence","Wearable computer","Wearable technology"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["bf5e7b4916bdafbc6ff31f485239faf65a9af233","3e0a271d9d5e2e42ed1212cf9e8a220de11633e1","982d4021a65e5f22a86125a156106d2848ef5d0d","1808b64aec21863489f0fe66f250890a3ac2b843","902ddd904effe50d228ea25ab23c16ae664d3ce5","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","88337c282d5c6592d71af89a85c51025dc8fd425","afadcedb08db54f46a98b21b8afe577f855f9439","4df5564bfacf056f600cc77b17eccfc218d45d16","19a09658e6c05b44136baf54571a884eb1a7b52e","626a9b76df298f977013d6eacf1a60525afb4f91","9facadf9a0faea64a202db1917a47ce92caf27e7","0156091af83cd6ec1e981ff4607b3e0dfe48ee9e","563e821bb5ea825efb56b77484f5287f08cf3753","3310cb2b0f1a473e6f98cdec6eb53ec6a962ac87","03ff3f8f4d5a700fbe8f3a3e63a39523c29bb60f","3cd32e91b60a091b9666e627a8f6c725882fca12","5b26c01c5056cedc3737729378dae407012591ef","990c6e227417e1797eea3edb91b992cc3d198aa7","17fac85921a6538161b30665f55991f7c7e0f940","c2a2ccd7be16e4bd896b9efe6225fbcac3cd8f27","52b28d7e1c39c86ceb2c9dd93216695f3735263e","4abc3b202ee9c1d3e16e508658c7a45b3afc5394","4afc353a68ce5cc9e17febaa3199da43ba549840","b788f1c013c6786cd44d6f35682a388975058488","83de43bc849ad3d9579ccf540e6fe566ef90a58e","0b1b95f2eded34c0ace2928c679c0ca3d85b45d6","61ef28caf5f2f72a2f66d27e5710f94653e13d9c","93a487990aea7ad4b72ffd47b5eb362494c1666f","84f7b9d697ad786a6ca6e4170c072b5882803229"],"id":"ffaef33e06c0f32b6c556d5521a43eebf608f5cc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ffaef33e06c0f32b6c556d5521a43eebf608f5cc","authors":[{"name":"Lingjuan Lyu","ids":["3366777"]},{"name":"Xuanli He","ids":["3422056"]},{"name":"Yee Wei Law","ids":["1728907"]},{"name":"Marimuthu Palaniswami","ids":["1721442"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132990"}

Among different spam types, a less explored area is OSN abuse that leverages the telephony channel to defraud users. Phone numbers are advertized via OSNs, and users are tricked into calling these numbers. To expand the reach of such scam / spam campaigns, phone numbers are advertised across multiple platforms like Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus, Flickr, and YouTube. In this paper, we present the first data-driven characterization of cross-platform campaigns that use multiple OSN platforms to reach their victims and use phone numbers for monetization. We collect -23M posts containing -1.8M unique phone numbers from Twitter, Facebook, GooglePlus, Youtube, and Flickr over a period of six months. Clustering these posts helps us identify 202 campaigns operating across the globe with Indonesia, United States, India, and United Arab Emirates being the most prominent originators. We find that even though Indonesian campaigns generate highest volume (-3.2M posts), only 1.6% of the accounts propagating Indonesian campaigns have been suspended so far. By examining campaigns running across multiple OSNs, we discover that Twitter detects and suspends -93% more accounts than Facebook. Therefore, sharing intelligence about abuse-related user accounts across OSNs can aid in spam detection. According to our dataset, around -35K victims and -$8.8M could have been saved if intelligence was shared across the OSNs. By analyzing phone number based spam campaigns running on OSNs, we highlight the unexplored variety of phone-based attacks surfacing on OSNs.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Under the Shadow of Sunshine: Characterizing Spam Campaigns Abusing Phone Numbers Across Online Social Networks","journalPages":"67-76","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201065","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00451v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00451"],"entities":["Anti-spam techniques","Ecosystem","Flickr","Google+","Interaction","Interactive voice response","Internet","Monetization","Regular expression","Spamming","Technical support","Telephone number","User (computing)","Video post-processing","WhatsApp Messenger"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0088523c4bf74b35c2e7471e740d6758ab36f7b9","8bd49ae102ccc62617d59c4b25531972d7be3b15","8dcd85df8268ee1ef4e59478b971b469c98a85bd","358843af3655391738c8435fc8a74eb49170e8ea","48ae5520e6a49dbb87d9c8f895c625e106474dc4","b154120ad4050668e1cbe337e6a2b32f29bcfd28","7302c34adfe86ebb2868f583e686421c9ddfdee3","028559e1c172fd41a5d656365172664d8269c9a5","214615f9c8d45da7c622e27a9ccac03c76035e4e","cc88ed7fee917555f13be25c6e6e60380a15ecee","6c2133b200e3b2e6d1d0d96d0b6dad22dc2bb779","6470930ff36cde541c837bedcf17c20490fedbbc","a5ce1a22c2c824f5151a08c4c0a5e42fe5eb7fab","424536ddab83337b6fed7ddebb32a3c4db30c8a8","32d16e35ac8801cf39a6a996429780d8c1a695fd","1fa86215010b27242700c6bd2e28853b1109fce2","78fe22f77eb45808bf50b2a1c22f3112aea88438","050f284ac0c00668f9f6a0882e545589b4012f56","383f1f2ceb32557690b6a0abf6aab48cb98552ff","7ce176ed696a5d31f42c8e0c3f593f3232b37119","9b5478a7a9188ccf34a5375efac9991e2cbec4c3","393ed20364b4be9f0ec4e8978e4b5c8e384aa2cf","d2e47b04b4dd88397d5a19db27ba6a0aa5d1317e","572009f92181ee5a7363dd5d42ac591ec523dea6","242ad6bf9d1c98643c7eb2276f969b1f344ca283","4f6487d61ba6c2afa44be0e870599bb292e27638","37092f9c79cb6220fd6f01882e9e3c1b41d0750e","2830246be09bbd376cd7f2ed9ae150110dcb08cf","5d07aedddee14b69efd0803aebdf1d5d19d2b657","1dd5355e62b9fc37a355e135d5909ed28128d653","169ba9e7cdf9d5d58e585890a9683975d7ec26c0","2f6ddce704d2daadb088cc03bec714bdb00b4f2a"],"id":"28526f972d1640e8cad22d42e29f5e70473a368e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/28526f972d1640e8cad22d42e29f5e70473a368e","authors":[{"name":"Srishti Gupta","ids":["46414949"]},{"name":"Dhruv Kuchhal","ids":["40845434"]},{"name":"Payas Gupta","ids":["2017454"]},{"name":"Mustaque Ahamad","ids":["1710123"]},{"name":"Manish Gupta","ids":["29960724"]},{"name":"Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","ids":["1734731"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201065"}

Topic modeling is then applied to detect the user's topical activity context to retrieve information. We demonstrate a system that proactively retrieves information from a user's activity history being observed on the screen when the user is performing unseen activities on a personal computer. We report an evaluation with ten participants that shows high user satisfaction and retrieval effectiveness.

In most of the cases, research funds (either public or private) and donations are supporting the creation and maintenance of WoD services. Applying typical Web financing mechanisms to the WoD is not straightforward, since the machine-processable nature of the WoD introduces new challenges. For example, users may access the data through applications that filter out advertisement. We believe that delayed-answer auctions are a possible way to overcome such a problem: when a user submits a query, the SPARQL endpoint serves the answers in sequence of batches. Behind the scenes, sponsors bid to increase the chances that data they are interested in promoting appears at the beginning of the sequence. In this demo, we show how this delayed-answer auction can be realized. We built a scenario where users can query for restaurants in New York City and restaurant owners act as sponsors.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Make Restaurants Pay Your Server Bills","journalPages":"","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4ae6/03720a08df71954f25a5f59e8452237930bc.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2180/paper-21.pdf"],"entities":["Communication endpoint","SPARQL","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["eb0d684f514e9dd03660f3db046a6e8a8ba94e7e","bc6e774c0f1d16fc8af0351fee504d216dc692af","da684368697118aee0d7bd35bde49dec70fad4e7"],"id":"4ae603720a08df71954f25a5f59e8452237930bc","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4ae603720a08df71954f25a5f59e8452237930bc","authors":[{"name":"Tobias Grubenmann","ids":["3431016"]},{"name":"Daniele Dell'Aglio","ids":["2307349"]},{"name":"Abraham Bernstein","ids":["1780758"]},{"name":"Dmitry Moor","ids":["28467220"]},{"name":"Sven Seuken","ids":["1884044"]}],"doi":""}

Our experiments are based on publicly available data and tasks from the BioASQ biomedical question answering challenge and demonstrate significant performance gains over a wide range of state-of-the-art models.","inCitations":["184bb6c1121890a01115af4140011280ef25ffce","2ae6220d37bea935d4d0b7e7248643d3e98e3ba3"],"pmid":"","title":"Biomedical Question Answering via Weighted Neural Network Passage Retrieval","journalPages":"523-528","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1773/932671cf2bbb8f3a1eab4def895dec915fde.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_39","http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02832","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02832v1.pdf"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Cosine similarity","Experiment","Question answering"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["a14343fe1af3fbc6e577f2269356fea678c7e767","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","6ac1962fd1f2b90da02c63c16af39a3c7a3e6df6","74e03acd5532fbad4c770e9293d2a788b11364f7","e0d2c0627c19da645d6711361b747568488e71ef","7161eb8d3b1cb01769a36528f9c6bddd663545a9","ca66a778d56c1b18d4db65482b3af23d842fa113","52eb8f4aa2ffcdf01f945fc8c3ad466855fd1567","b29bf8f6900b4b0258397f73957eabd1bb977ef4","8abd9da4a3549976d01e5fc6c19ea4cdfb31c3bd"],"id":"1773932671cf2bbb8f3a1eab4def895dec915fde","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1773932671cf2bbb8f3a1eab4def895dec915fde","authors":[{"name":"Ferenc Galkó","ids":["35440148"]},{"name":"Carsten Eickhoff","ids":["1764160"]}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_39"}

QED is particularly challenging because queries are often too short to provide rich contextual information that is required by traditional entity disambiguation methods. In this paper, we propose several methods to tackle the problem of QED. First, we explore the use of deep neural network (DNN) for capturing the character level textual information in queries. Our DNN approach maps queries and their candidate reference entities to feature vectors in a latent semantic space where the distance between a query and its correct reference entity is minimized. Second, we utilize the Web search result information of queries to help generate large amounts of weakly supervised training data for the DNN model. Third, we propose a two-stage training method to combine large-scale weakly supervised data with a small amount of human labeled data, which can significantly boost the performance of a DNN model. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in the experiments using large-scale real-world datasets.","inCitations":["b6ef3817f795d4f5eb45255a2e0f77e164bf6701","80ab42e0352be4604597dc3130ad074d266f29e5","51bf901f64239ede59f6cef4609c21a318f7d479","d9a633d57312f59393fcf98e1f5f25b3b5cbf904","22f2dae897c8df800666e42ff1869d70a5126d60"],"pmid":"","title":"Deep Context Modeling for Web Query Entity Disambiguation","journalPages":"1757-1765","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132856"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Baseline (configuration management)","Deep learning","Entity Bean","Experiment","Knowledge base","Map","Teaching method","Web search engine","Word-sense disambiguation","World Wide Web"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["1e7cf9047604f39e517951d129b2b3eecf9e1cfb","97201a0b80fd0b38fd023019751e34365f62a7cb","07abd02f02774d178f26ca99937e5f94001a9ec9","445c8907f09c649da1c0e70f26d15d44667b5152","0aedae19e94d76520cb92932b6506389799051e2","0b3cfbf79d50dae4a16584533227bb728e3522aa","1d2a4018b4fc6a5f498e65d68260615dbc9e7ec6","209da37048fd9d549df583490929adbe089d0805","67ef895cf40c75108ef913dd41f3c98eb66494d7","15d47f951a888955cad94127da9664d49f72791c","0483f11717096a27648de7ee73780db3233bf306","9ebb12faa38a9c7e2a43da932abe907a92933000","1c9aca60f7ac5edcceb73d612806704a7d662643","1c909ac1c331c0c246a88da047cbdcca9ec9b7e7","379f601a467e2bdb9ac4f51f87734bb60eb1701f","e1b11add582bed8cc77ac667139f56feb87f4a7e","0891ed6ed64fb461bc03557b28c686f87d880c9a","5b9534442f91a87022427b74bca9fd95dd045383","0825788b9b5a18e3dfea5b0af123b5e939a4f564","3f93022a06b0bdab8c9729864552fabab0aa687c","582ea307db25c5764e7d2ed82c4846757f4e95d7","4015bce2713d4e5a6d78b05989d28763e763547d","57166612b98f291b85bbcaaef0c1bdfa234935fc","81f8706abcecfc748f2e27d6f7a92628036d6846","10edc125d8e2685d5650034626d3ad4da8129de0","ab6f4fcb9ef8bcfbdc81d4b2210c07eae19006de","22ae02d81c21cb90b0de071550cfb99e6a623e62","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50"],"id":"d7f84654f414bb25b21ab3901871380ee04e34b2","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d7f84654f414bb25b21ab3901871380ee04e34b2","authors":[{"name":"Zhen Liao","ids":["2345942"]},{"name":"Xinying Song","ids":["2831106"]},{"name":"Yelong Shen","ids":["1752875"]},{"name":"Saekoo Lee","ids":["28279337"]},{"name":"Jianfeng Gao","ids":["1800422"]},{"name":"Ciya Liao","ids":["2922252"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132856"}

Online social media such as Twitter could describe adverse drug events in real-time, prior to official reporting. Deep learning has significantly improved text classification performance in recent years and can potentially enhance ADE classification in tweets. However, these models typically require large corpora with human expert-derived labels, and such resources are very expensive to generate and are hardly available. Semi-supervised deep learning models, which offer a plausible alternative to fully supervised models, involve the use of a small set of labeled data and a relatively larger collection of unlabeled data for training. Traditionally, these models are trained on labeled and unlabeled data from similar topics or domains. In reality, millions of tweets generated daily often focus on disparate topics, and this could present a challenge for building deep learning models for ADE classification with random Twitter stream as unlabeled training data. In this work, we build several semi-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) models for ADE classification in tweets, specifically leveraging different types of unlabeled data in developing the models to address the problem. We demonstrate that, with the selective use of a variety of unlabeled data, our semi-supervised CNN models outperform a strong state-ofthe-art supervised classification model by +9.9% F1-score. We evaluated our models on the Twitter data set used in the PSB 2016 Social Media Shared Task. Our results present the new state-of-the-art for this data set.","inCitations":["41901ec0220c2cbc1f848eb5fab00fd9e4acb3d3","9b4fe5c590412014037d7e9e1e952c1d6fbe2e74","a402112d6138248d9cd1c72be82c4d6aced6eaf1","c6959db5f01de25dca7ee261b4b662b27a29ec57","fe727547a3a67d4a3088fe3882a70d6d1ecdac6e","0334c1dd595d3ca3b257d0395a90d952c9e5dad3","bae7e9fc4c7b2fd9fdabd50575b48cb3058cb7c6","fed42a11a736fcf371bd15ade105769dba81f648","020aab2262a67bb74c5ee7ff2778717accfdbcaf","b979dacbf06af8e9263e701ec99a2a9609ea9140","a356420fecd0df431e724b4640e537c2af7114be","9000711dcaf9cd851722fde9bea0bd9101a692f1","71b5eab53434ec001c0d43101bb25d518205b063","0c4caca964314b27b344a1b75da669118484f341","b96695e4a8a0d2d289cdae1e3d9bad5c8275c738","822b0375d6fefa6561a94e03fd85ddc329b88599","f01d0e78ff949e52aef9857e46da258ed21a1338"],"pmid":"","title":"Adverse Drug Event Detection in Tweets with Semi-Supervised Convolutional Neural Networks","journalPages":"705-714","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c3c7/b458bcde8cf8509e8224d6e6a22878ecdab6.pdf","pdfUrls":["http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p705.pdf","http://www.cs.utah.edu/~asheq/publications/WWW17-ADE.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3038912.3052671"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Convolutional neural network","Deep learning","Document classification","F1 score","Machine learning","Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing","Real-time transcription","Semiconductor industry","Social media","Supervised learning","Text corpus"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["563e821bb5ea825efb56b77484f5287f08cf3753","ce668a88e34dc8df1a95c7292688413274b8ed0b","883bc369e31d7320ca83bb8f53d0b3909d636f72","2e7d4fe6977f15a63eccf7c70ae6e62aee296bdc","7d9089cbe958da21cbd943bdbcb996f4499e701b","de481259aeccffd2dbdcea8c4e9fa0ab8cd32c8b","023cc7f9f3544436553df9548a7d0575bb309c2e","854cdfa80420f1aa9fef20aaf1254cc26a007972","7869aac63457dd7423dba15eab74a4002c3b5208","e9ec8ee0d0f80f7246007684c97a42afbff31ed7","1f1eaf19e38b541eec8a02f099e3090536a4c936","2e10643c3759f97b673ff8c297778c0b6c20032b","0a7c04c252621633992810bf0f184f287610c461","0ef5a90b7e294f0dafddd2b11b5bea455fc97e52","b0aca3e7877c3c20958b0fae5cbf2dd602104859","c829b63a3ae72a47e1953e1295826c7b2f93bf50","9b93adb82c6c4100d17fc56eedd4e67a134ccbd2","f13d7e3400c45049eb96d269d3de9bfd522a4b64","098165fb11bec53aa4c2045c9fd5857523b4c438","6697802b56a229a9ec27b94815f893d42d20eb3d","945457c205c9c50281c480d5b7a17c6dd6211cdb","14347af6ab135fae319dcbff9fe573fbe757d99f","645c9d018d6379a4c2eed5ab2f62aeb5629544ce","96d5e44a55ca61e3c11e9fce4cf71d451698c72b","fc4364a1d6068325f264d306fd9f9bc6c1a94230","3738e35f7b288f8689c41bbe9d5a6a6b0c430831","b13a00277cc791cbc3f85a941041232502a31387","670c26b6740c307b0fc1bf4ea1421af2ba636daa","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","03ff3f8f4d5a700fbe8f3a3e63a39523c29bb60f","9dbd19c14816bcffc9d806b03bdb3aa1a0f6f222","687e45af41bbe81646e052a716b71c3032a75de0","1949be63e6107d7a7beb0c24adfee75a84e25826","3ffefe237ec9e8ac4757580204d64f3288bd753a","7e51514e97df2cb256d264a8901f56a371f55c4a","39cd4639e724523fe517c18df87a3daa20814799","d9b5dfeb32613b9d22b87a51d5ca58f3bbf6412d","1c61f9ef06fe74505775a833ff849185757199e7","228651a77b5434795b3674acfe190ff74236975a"],"id":"c3c7b458bcde8cf8509e8224d6e6a22878ecdab6","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3c7b458bcde8cf8509e8224d6e6a22878ecdab6","authors":[{"name":"Kathy Lee","ids":["1694037"]},{"name":"Ashequl Qadir","ids":["2845895"]},{"name":"Sadid A.

The system we propose offers a rich online interface allowing arbitrary queries and complex analytics over large scale historical textual data, letting users investigate changes in meaning, context and word relationships across time.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Every Word has its History: Interactive Exploration and Visualization of Word Sense Evolution","journalPages":"1899-1902","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.dl.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~adam/cikm18.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3269218"],"entities":["Interactivity","Text corpus","Word sense"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["419794ac69424b3cd66127c909dde325fe88c463","0eef0dcf7daa1df2eddb4b6f1947827f5a289132","452657328b80ca26a85c381e66a3bc92fe130dca","0470c5898908c145cd060a5bff3a7120383df3ad","714958f525fd285856dad01a87c88e529f53e453"],"id":"dce5787dd248f4b2c304f98a91ff6cdbdeb211c7","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dce5787dd248f4b2c304f98a91ff6cdbdeb211c7","authors":[{"name":"Adam Jatowt","ids":["1774986"]},{"name":"Ricardo Campos","ids":["1782474"]},{"name":"Sourav S.

A considerably extensive range of centrality measures exist that serve the purpose of quantifying the importance of a node according to its application and domain. One such measure is the Betweenness Centrality (BC) which computes the importance of a node in terms of total number of shortest paths that pass through that node. However, these computations are very expensive and pose different challenges for large scale networks. With an attempt to deal with these challenges, our paper presents an approximate algorithm for BC maximization problem, which tries to find a set of nodes with largest BC. The core of our algorithm is the estimation technique, which is based on progressive sampling with early stopping conditions. The reduction in sample size results not only in small computations overhead, but also scales well with large networks. We experimentally evaluate our technique using different datasets to confirm the performance of the developed techniques.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Identifying Top-K Influential Nodes in Networks","journalPages":"2219-2222","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133126"],"entities":["Approximation algorithm","Betweenness centrality","Computation","Early stopping","Expectation\u2013maximization algorithm","Experiment","Overhead (computing)","Sampling (signal processing)","Shortest path problem","Social network analysis"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["286e5e773b5c0278239d988900b175d4e9e872f6","cb2a2d5f152b406b681fe30f4e1da256b5b84e71","2f73b0dbfcfe260e6f2c19eea3877c8fcc0c9c3b","2e0d94d072d79ba73c9a153a228b93520b3ce670","7e6b0b7e82fb4d0a6c3206af16f6c9b8a9b22a01","23d85a0008429845870780c6db3640c05165acaf","1562d6e590aac6e754ce750190ef17060c4a1e93","1541dc5a7245125b164f5e99749919de9f358434","31699c35f42e4d9d108b4c595f9cea9655f5022e","1ef8c8c815b7268d7f7d4fe76af78aaa8df3e6da"],"id":"26bb9cf17c0ea72283c8d24c9902390d6a33f167","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/26bb9cf17c0ea72283c8d24c9902390d6a33f167","authors":[{"name":"Sara Mumtaz","ids":["48178330"]},{"name":"Xiaoyang Wang","ids":["47120317"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133126"}

For example, most of the publicly available data from online social networking services (such as Facebook and Twitter) are collected via apps, users who make their accounts public, and/or the resources available to the researcher/practitioner. Such incompleteness can lead to inaccurate findings. We introduce the Adaptive Edge Probing problem. Suppose that one has observed a networked phenomenon via some form of sampling and has a budget to enhance the incomplete network by asking for additional information about specific nodes, with the ultimate goal of obtaining the most valuable information about the network as a whole. Which nodes should be further explored? We present ε-WGX, a network-based explore-exploit algorithm for identifying which nodes in the incomplete network to probe. Aggregated over multiple datasets and a wide range of probing budgets, we find that ε-WGX outperforms other explore-exploit strategies and baseline probing strategies. For example, for the task of adding as many nodes as possible, over incomplete networks observed via four popular sampling methods, ε-WGX outperforms the best comparison strategy by 12%-23% on average.","inCitations":["62ed209d9433c4084bde78e5e447931a3bf97f7e","96f29841042462dd966ae3e4d836ce8c969c4298","cc184262e1a71322612828eddc2ee4cab22451db"],"pmid":"","title":"ε - WGX: Adaptive Edge Probing for Enhancing Incomplete Networks","journalPages":"161-170","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091492","http://eliassi.org/papers/soundarajan-websci17.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Baseline (configuration management)","Sampling (signal processing)"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0409e56956560dba788dfb3adc467f3475606c24","248bbb34e33bc5e5d3a5fa986b6f96b81a54b00b","084bd6a652cbc07ffeae4385a3964da24f62a7e0","6c16ffc774a93285cc5d2eb0b49dc10140df9c74","55a43ac8ee3464756123ae5b4a55e1d947e2abec","2a56a1a776beda725f8d1873eef6dc82396c90d1","43c6fcc29d368521e50008c6b8e86ddff251afd7","ca7ac27531db0aff9403db5bafbcba2e31e93785","a6f400353c138644008c905d7087ac8bd23b0a55","2f230a46b4939fa75f266b8419f907dc0d4fb5db","2f103cf8b2cf7d2e4c877c52bfad2847b6fbfd92","32f233df5853d57c39d4659405c8355d725e9e8e","f4bd6691f59eb95c58b6d104d5122158ab7ddaa4","1b3c86ad6c149941750d97bd72b6b0122c1d8b5e","4596d4b283f9709a2ee0b9ee90a3a2ddd580a7f3","7bf3774e980d836acab5980553c24e40695b7edc","73b7d356289298f479c1ba6459b4e797de4f8f0c"],"id":"f70e4050a73585cf5bcf5d28e27ae46056e840e8","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f70e4050a73585cf5bcf5d28e27ae46056e840e8","authors":[{"name":"Sucheta Soundarajan","ids":["2370207"]},{"name":"Tina Eliassi-Rad","ids":["1684421"]},{"name":"Brian Gallagher","ids":["5651532"]},{"name":"Ali Pinar","ids":["1745160"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3091478.3091492"}

There exists plenty of works which model these processes as a matching problem, which focuses on how to estimate the relevance score between a document and a query. However, little is known about what happened during the reading process, i.e., how users allocate their attention while reading a document during a specific information retrieval task. We believe that a better understanding of this process can help us design better weighting functions inside the document and contributes to the improvement of ranking performance. In this paper, we focus on the reading process during relevance judgement task. We designed a lab-based user study to investigate human reading patterns in assessing a document, where users' eye movements and their labeled relevant text were collected, respectively. Through a systematic analysis into the collected data, we propose a two-stage reading model which consists of a preliminary relevance judgement stage (Stage 1) and a reading with preliminary relevance stage (Stage 2). In addition, we investigate how different behavior biases affect users' reading behaviors in these two stages. Taking these biases into consideration, we further build prediction models for user's reading attention. Experiment results show that query independent features outperform query dependent features, which indicates that users allocate attentions based on many signals other than query terms in this process. Our study sheds light on the understanding of users' attention allocation during relevance judgement and provides implications for improving the design of existing ranking models.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"Understanding Reading Attention Distribution during Relevance Judgement.","journalPages":"733-742","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/publications/CIKM18Li.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3269206.3271764"],"entities":["Information retrieval","Matching (graph theory)","Natural language understanding","Question answering","Relevance","Usability testing"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["0b811838fbd235d10e627c9d3ccca0df0a94c13d","197a7fc2f8d57d93727b348851b59b34ce990afd","32a3eccc2ea6568cb9914a4cc921f37d46da41b6","755e76db387fc5c37d58095af3acab98d5b0b683","17a65f10b38ddb06d035d0aa5e2898c563b24a54","c9a966dd1b284e1456facc574a386832dea1ed72","7bd581bf31f5a0292adc03148a488f973738f1d3","146f6f6ed688c905fb6e346ad02332efd5464616","b6c16cf596b38bc2b2f0fed3058b58155c0d50e4","447137e7e7d254a841cecdd3a5b2de9cad88b227","071b16f25117fb6133480c6259227d54fc2a5ea0","f3016d731c2409818005b5ab7329f4c048eb984d","51ce417db8b01e3ee1bc825a96b484de33ee03f3","2024bc57379c4a34609135fb6fc987550a082149","a15e96c6d3e4c649fca03baf31af030023f8b5c6","063fe83f6870bda172b9a9f14ce6518274c45b75","58bb899449ef5af014df80bd7fcb2b1fcf5eb63a","326be02c089047f5f86d9b6b539ededc0ea51024","6d1eb878e1d2530c197c962dd4a61d2aba015261","0beeb77c16e7866a23991f3718b25312af55d3e9","ecb3446d27fd79f38930a2ff5fb236e96b002401","36ac16a3c62c7166d832a3594a7fd2f0fbed1f5c","5b43e5f8028d6d6d6f2d4f1fca0c594b527e1a49","e19a988d115eaa534b292e2422e8628ca44d48a4","16e9c5f1e4e2357b91d8e282cee9b67178061d26","c771ed2164253ebea25b1ef4c4a2870683090a3b","a9594661794fdaa1859124577722b26e2b3a862f","89774f17d4ae199ea6950b747bf21e390a6e023a","7276644e0bb8c50eb2d8530ea7a8b86590fc3281","13d72ef522b405c18f7d228c5744687609b4c3a4","357b1b911696fc636a1a1d59bc7d847655474825","c207f078e77f1ce0e10b5baa781214633c27f452","8953f8c3e26b05f53246d04aacba951acac74cd9","012927ab94f0e542ce137e032b0288bbfbc2f9ca","6d74c216d8246c2a356b00426af715102af2a172","b00bb8acf3a573d7663222412160b60c0c6db796","7a43cdd0e8e4b628af6619812c73b2f2d524d0bb","7f4576300bcf52345309d3d3af296912b2162045","d2991874e0f6f704202a81d712e782218a34b57d","5248e638bbbb214151bda597cb289d486e5999c1","0c7af3ac61ec8d65c2cadb8317181d192c232be9","4653b04e72be50f032750256a6d5c725b553965e"],"id":"18d0157344457bc4730472c31060869bf4a1a9ee","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/18d0157344457bc4730472c31060869bf4a1a9ee","authors":[{"name":"Xiangsheng Li","ids":["48569337"]},{"name":"Yiqun Liu","ids":["1783406"]},{"name":"Jiaxin Mao","ids":["3340223"]},{"name":"Zexue He","ids":["35896730"]},{"name":"Min Zhang","ids":["1700777"]},{"name":"Shaoping Ma","ids":["8093158"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3269206.3271764"}

In particular, the massive data generated from users\u2019 usage logs provide the possibilities for stakeholders to know better about consumer behaviors with the aid of data mining. In this paper, we examine the consumer behaviors across multiple platforms based on a largescale mobile Internet dataset from a major telecom operator, which covers 9.8 million users from two regions among which 1.4 million users have visited e-commerce platforms within one week of our study. We make several interesting observations and examine users\u2019 cultural differences from different regions. Our analysis shows among the multiple e-commerce platforms available, most mobile users are loyal to their favorable sites; people (60%) tend to make quick decisions to buy something online, which usually takes less than half an hour. Furthermore, we find that people in residential areas are much easier to perform purchases than in business districts and purchases take place during non-work time. Meanwhile, people with medium socioeconomic status like browsing and purchasing on e-commerce platforms, while people with high and low socioeconomic status are much easier to conduct purchases online. We also show the predictability of cross-platform shopping ∗1. H. Huang and H.

Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) is a flexible statistical learning technique for classification and regression at the state of the art for training effective LtR solutions. Indeed, the success of GBRT fostered the development of several open-source LtR libraries targeting efficiency of the learning phase and effectiveness of the resulting models. However, these libraries offer only very limited help for the tuning and evaluation of the trained models. In addition, the implementations provided for even the most traditional IR evaluation metrics differ from library to library, thus making the objective evaluation and comparison between trained models a difficult task. RankEval addresses these issues by providing a common ground for LtR libraries that offers useful and interoperable tools for a comprehensive comparison and in-depth analysis of ranking models.","inCitations":["ac1b31d9b8aa359371572d90d092cdc4e05da5aa"],"pmid":"","title":"RankEval: An Evaluation and Analysis Framework for Learning-to-Rank Solutions","journalPages":"1281-1284","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3077136.3084140"],"entities":["Decision tree","Gradient","Interoperability","Learning to rank","Library (computing)","Machine learning","Open-source software","Statistical classification"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["26bc9195c6343e4d7f434dd65b4ad67efe2be27a","7cc6f311536f0fbdc6136bcd1cb009282c92f564","582ea307db25c5764e7d2ed82c4846757f4e95d7","a8817ff4d855b2021bb3b725c613c68428c4587d"],"id":"3edb5eb55cb3d39931d6568b16e30eb81732f47c","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3edb5eb55cb3d39931d6568b16e30eb81732f47c","authors":[{"name":"Claudio Lucchese","ids":["1730904"]},{"name":"Cristina Ioana Muntean","ids":["2344737"]},{"name":"Franco Maria Nardini","ids":["2763561"]},{"name":"Raffaele Perego","ids":["46188036"]},{"name":"Salvatore Trani","ids":["2471674"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3077136.3084140"}

Using deep learning frameworks, such as Torch and Tensorflow, CNN can be efficiently computed by leveraging the power of GPU. However, one drawback of GPU is its limited memory which prohibits us from handling large images. Passing a 4K resolution image to the VGG network will result in an exception of out-of-memory for Titan-X GPU. In this paper, we propose a new approach that adopts the BSP (bulk synchronization parallel) model to compute CNNs for images of any size. Before fed to a specific CNN layer, the image is split into smaller pieces which go through the neural network separately. Then, a specific padding and normalization technique is adopted to merge sub-images back into one image. Our approach can be easily extended to support distributed multi-GPUs. In this paper, we use neural style network as our example to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. We show that using one Titan-X GPU, we can transfer the style of an image with 10,000×10,000 pixels within 1 minute.","inCitations":["b9559815293200ef9566cf679b5c5dd478769f82"],"pmid":"","title":"A New Approach to Compute CNNs for Extremely Large Images","journalPages":"39-48","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132872"],"entities":["4K resolution","Artificial neural network","Computation","Computer vision","Convolution","Convolutional neural network","Database normalization","Deep learning","Experiment","Face detection","Graphics processing unit","Out of memory","Outline of object recognition","Padding (cryptography)","Performance","Pixel","TensorFlow","Titan Rain","Torch"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["77c512cbb832436e1a35ad434e6bb3d763799763","1827de6fa9c9c1b3d647a9d707042e89cf94abf0","b0aca3e7877c3c20958b0fae5cbf2dd602104859","7246777c1ec550a91301772040fa0534893f9465","3ba79761192aa4bddd3342db03aa8187516c0fab","14318685b5959b51d0f1e3db34643eb2855dc6d9","915c4bb289b3642489e904c65a47fa56efb60658","31ad6a97942caa3bc4929becbc85f60eadfa9552","2315fc6c2c0c4abd2443e26a26e7bb86df8e24cc","8dc550724c004daaa5a12ddf02ab06b54303eb7b","061356704ec86334dbbc073985375fe13cd39088","b0e0ccb48dd027253140e0992e8bddf605672974","043afbd936c95d0e33c4a391365893bd4102f1a7","0626908dd710b91aece1a81f4ca0635f23fc47f3","23d14ab0f18fa881a2ac8ae027be6b9f2c91d74d","1f6ba0782862ec12a5ec6d7fb608523d55b0c6ba","6de2b1058c5b717878cce4e7e50d3a372cc4aaa6","2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d"],"id":"511dadaefbbe2b2e31991f0d28f74ff560e222e1","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/511dadaefbbe2b2e31991f0d28f74ff560e222e1","authors":[{"name":"Sai Wu","ids":["1765710"]},{"name":"Mengdan Zhang","ids":["2516588"]},{"name":"Gang Chen","ids":["48390827"]},{"name":"Ke Chen","ids":["38429669"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132872"}

Such misinformation has the potential of affecting public opinion, providing an opportunity for malicious parties to manipulate the outcomes of public events such as elections. Because such high stakes are at play, automatically detecting fake news is an important, yet challenging problem that is not yet well understood. Nevertheless, there are three generally agreed upon characteristics of fake news: the text of an article, the user response it receives, and the source users promoting it. Existing work has largely focused on tailoring solutions to one particular characteristic which has limited their success and generality.\n In this work, we propose a model that combines all three characteristics for a more accurate and automated prediction. Specifically, we incorporate the behavior of both parties, users and articles, and the group behavior of users who propagate fake news. Motivated by the three characteristics, we propose a model called CSI which is composed of three modules: Capture, Score, and Integrate. The first module is based on the response and text; it uses a Recurrent Neural Network to capture the temporal pattern of user activity on a given article. The second module learns the source characteristic based on the behavior of users, and the two are integrated with the third module to classify an article as fake or not. Experimental analysis on real-world data demonstrates that CSI achieves higher accuracy than existing models, and extracts meaningful latent representations of both users and articles.","inCitations":["3f5a4d5613f2ae01f9ffbbdd7e834dab96d51a51","4c2d04e3c977839fc524a6bda4d18bdefcc8ce2b","8b7b376b6e8f937ebb38806f5c126247cf21f08b","5a1cfd6266461d891680c6b5272506cd74b532ce","06a107ef7e798d59b53501a7e6657d4627d0eed9","eae012a562d343b16eedb7d14321a0785a4cdb80","d1234bc63fae2840b7e4b3d6956665d5f96beaf9","5c107e9d3e09bc33c416cd214d3760ba8c32a470","547ea1927e9f7ff01b60738e06c43ce4cb0b1a3c","8fd1d13e18c5ef8b57296adab6543cb810c36d81","bc8c416f821b93795370524247c8a455c373ee6e","de1f192f34f4521ed5cabc8db1ff608c5ee11bcc","3fd8df6eee50108720159bacf54dd77da889eed3","03aa69b71705890cb1555effddbd91ade9aa234c","653ea2c486a3ffbc89b08c1eed7167a4296bdfbb","16bd3d272529075864600b16247965fd3b26d062","cb40a5e6d4fc0290452345791bb91040aed76961","672cfe5f7fb674dc0834e412c38ef1cdc711e802","ef3eeb1af61e6fe57df8f66360608a0c322e5cfc","8f3dc77c482f23cfafd80fc0bafd0a5ca0246e76","348666d80123c631f7946daa157602a296795d32","8594d9d30039065f542ef9db62d1a840cf4c3562","5772b38c9dbf5db53338a402747867b8c92b7c87","4c76af4899bc9e17280d43fa9b6add3a271e9728","e6009df23a51f69fe067d5aeb1e5955bf0d370a5","107b12c5c69bcd8e3d459066b424d04a2b12025f","06b96ccf6847ed04561a437c76d54057a672d231","d4bbd9c7d95f00a5acaef2f2a48f8543f52df18a","f97ffe772ac44ce8b2a427ed7f68fd0b3281a12f","1737253c3c1cd4466d195e421fc6d5af10096ad0","7f80ec2656666fc6f7a136aa14dc790798032b30","2871d18d0f60a0801e1a08109479b81a49eb4b24","eff57ffb739564a8c2b8996908a481c921d90f29","24e56a1b8e1d4f32efc64a220da19f948a2942e6"],"pmid":"","title":"CSI: A Hybrid Deep Model for Fake News Detection","journalPages":"797-806","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132877","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06959v2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06959v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06959v4.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06959"],"entities":["Artificial neural network","Camera Serial Interface","Crowdsourcing","Library (computing)","Malware","Recurrent neural network","Reinforcement learning","Sensor"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["9a331d68b3c559f1831be3fce5c35623616e04e6","1510cf4b8abea80b9f352325ca4c132887de21a0","638975fc415cfcec60f3f1a7217ca61c00a321f0","06d4572892665fc1522253df634a237012cd79c8","cb9355d11aabfac2eac54a7a38219a006a7548b7","2cc0807e33e83b04df005b55003b934414ccf2b6","a5a4db6b066d58c1281d1e83be821216d22696f3","374dbadfa8a3ae5982a23900ce23252a3ef71bcf","0bff8196bd103df59e25dd762d05f80fef283d3f","03fe33ffc8d87e408f2e8411a624381efd8b66db","37aaa2c2da2876ca5ebbfe396f942d3094d5ee30","0a7c04c252621633992810bf0f184f287610c461","0814694a247a9b6e38dde34ab95067a63f67e458","cdb328937e989ab62492e105512864d7cfff381e","dc049b06ae2a33ea5afe76d7f5136cb7afd5317d","308fb9872f256dd043e580930169a7fb851cd888","469070120d709abe97455c8eb7b239f53ae0e3bf","530d2b07898a610a3c7de19c01b71dc4b5a6dd5d","c9c74f18b974b0e3e4b44184e17aaefd05ee01d0","02fd02b1789716d55a784df1f26895c18deba13f","77552068c33783e8a1bc35b8d3018edbd825ed92","828dbeb7cf922dc9b6657dd169b8d26d2b58eedb","88a38d820a4dde01111112263ea1db5db97d0ab7","7d73730bb403785ccd4e2c07240f1f1f898e156c","171119fe4dd90cbce253334767f727c44ca32385","29936111122f09b97e0736ebb6a03d1ad3f5fa92","04a5042b55db8f8af4cce4982a191ae9eace1cb2","37c90fcd3016171e9f3ac86f7f88b390fe86ee99","12de03e2691c11d29a82f1c3fc7e97121c07cb5b","aac8ca93d72544ad5e94550b01e2a4f477d4c1ff","121822b16a8b33378929b52506e24ec92cf74f8f","e8ee46df8e2116e425abf0cec9604fbf155d4d39","1e3d1055fc65966bc2c64505785207d7e8d71022","bfc07bc8cc2e39bd2e408528711ed6a34a76bd0b","a467ac2ebbfcb3cf57737022724c3eba7f91c2d7","39dba6f22d72853561a4ed684be265e179a39e4f"],"id":"ca66ee90a262281922bd2eb0a55ab5f340385dfa","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ca66ee90a262281922bd2eb0a55ab5f340385dfa","authors":[{"name":"Natali Ruchansky","ids":["2820106"]},{"name":"Sungyong Seo","ids":["3370023"]},{"name":"Yan Liu","ids":["47909587"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3132877"}

A variety of methods has been explored to debias click data for learning to rank such as click models, result interleaving and, more recently, the unbiased learning-to-rank framework based on inverse propensity weighting. Despite their differences, most existing studies separate the estimation of click bias (namely the propensity model ) from the learning of ranking algorithms. To estimate click propensities, they either conduct online result randomization, which can negatively affect the user experience, or offline parameter estimation, which has special requirements for click data and is optimized for objectives (e.g. click likelihood) that are not directly related to the ranking performance of the system. In this work, we address those problems by unifying the learning of propensity models and ranking models. We find that the problem of estimating a propensity model from click data is a dual problem of unbiased learning to rank. Based on this observation, we propose a Dual Learning Algorithm (DLA) that jointly learns an unbiased ranker and an unbiased propensity model. DLA is an automatic unbiased learning-to-rank framework as it directly learns unbiased ranking models from biased click data without any preprocessing. It can adapt to the change of bias distributions and is applicable to online learning. Our empirical experiments with synthetic and real-world data show that the models trained with DLA significantly outperformed the unbiased learning-to-rank algorithms based on result randomization and the models trained with relevance signals extracted by click models.","inCitations":["10cdb2f8943e2589673818e7f4d630464de94553","600a6370fb124824814470a7f189020d9fe417a9","ad41a81e52f70d56fb0a7526a0a35ad972b49d94","fe7d8d3e703dc653b32f1644c8f636cad32a8752","5bf3c6fe470c799bcc935226c19104cdb76ecb8e","e01afd8b7c12894fbe0d48fd87045d9b2ad4c5e3"],"pmid":"","title":"Unbiased Learning to Rank with Unbiased Propensity Estimation","journalPages":"385-394","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05938","https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3209986","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1804.05938","https://929153a2-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/qingyaoai/research/SIGIR18-ULTR.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crH-xye5_DLsIuTMVkalev_BEfv3OVlB-cDI9c0jTtTt6KNvSbmcD46ESgFzIzzsbMy04dbFbSIqC9SiilPP9Qit4GRr0nC5HFb3bRao74H_98vOKR_2Ht6DV8RtL5MRE4wm2hP2pCY0FXtcdI3Qvu59u_c8sisBbmNG3CtpQzjDu1_SXeebjrbUIUoivtYTBldB75ZYo7VwGouk2iPMW5kq5J8v8CHLJTAHEMZa5203K0e_Hk%3D&attredirects=0&d=1","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05938v2.pdf"],"entities":["Algorithm","Algorithmic learning theory","Clickstream","Consistency model","Drive letter assignment","Duality (optimization)","Estimation theory","Experiment","Forward error correction","Learning to rank","Online and offline","Preprocessor","Ranking (information retrieval)","Relevance","Requirement","Synthetic intelligence","User experience"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["dbcd79bd7edcdcbb5912a50796fc3c2746729eb5","0df9c70875783a73ce1e933079f328e8cf5e9ea2","613cd84894ee61e51bca03a1e4feae8624617399","10ceb668f84860bb09fca364125cae4b1ee2e760","f0b5bd1ea9af8582f5d7231be90092001f693236","e414228a3b1a5d0079f880246b7421a36c9e858a"],"id":"f45cfe62446fc2d1b5ad9c351a2438faaa9c6553","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f45cfe62446fc2d1b5ad9c351a2438faaa9c6553","authors":[{"name":"Qingyao Ai","ids":["35531065"]},{"name":"Keping Bi","ids":["2112104"]},{"name":"Cheng Luo","ids":["1755091"]},{"name":"Jiafeng Guo","ids":["1777025"]},{"name":"W.

The Web is as Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned it, a vast resource of interconnected knowledge. Yet that resource exists in a universe of its own. Meanwhile the real world has become crowded with connected devices, none more significant than the smartphone bringing the Web to eighty percent of the planet\u2019s adult population by the end of this decade. Smartphones have become fantastically adept at navigating cyberspace, but with the singular exception of maps have few real connections to the world immediately at hand. In 2017 we live in two worlds: the Web, and the real. The time has come to knit these two together. To begin that integration, our first step must be a deep moment of contemplation about what the Web and the real world have to offer one another. How can each amplify the value and capacity of the other? Because of the Web, the real world is pregnant with data and knowledge what does that world look like? How do we use it? How does it change the way we think and behave? In this simple act of design thinking toward a \u2018Web-wide world\u2019 we can reframe the possibilities of what both the Web and the real world can offer and what we can offer both. This is the next great project for the Web finding its place in the world.

However, before one can gain insight into the properties or structure of a network, one must first collect appropriate data. Data collection poses several challenges, such as API or bandwidth limits, which require the data collector to carefully consider which queries to make. Many online network crawling methods have been proposed, but it is not always clear which method should be used for a given network. In this paper, we perform a detailed, hypothesis-driven analysis of several online crawling algorithms, ranging from classical crawling methods to modern, state-of-the-art algorithms, with respect to the task of collecting as much data (nodes or edges) as possible given a fixed query budget. We show that the performance of these methods depends strongly on the network structure. We identify three relevant network characteristics: community separation, average community size, and average node degree. We present experiments on both real and synthetic networks, and provide guidelines to researchers regarding selection of an appropriate sampling method.","inCitations":["3ca62ccc398a7476f39444340e2baf421b3dba56"],"pmid":"","title":"Guidelines for Online Network Crawling: A Study of Data Collection Approaches and Network Properties","journalPages":"57-66","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3201064.3201066"],"entities":["Algorithm","Apollonian network","Application programming interface","Breadth-first search","Categorization","Computational science","Experiment","Graph traversal","Sampling (signal processing)","Social network analysis","Synthetic data","Synthetic intelligence","Tree traversal","Web crawler"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["2fae3f195555871a1ce94afa660c74bf42a11638","9e3212ae7d0bcb0b0abfebd130c2f3d38944f231","21081f3c94bfa12e99ad7cee9e2c5b0afe7a397d","1ed8886fb8a9ba6b57b8742d0e5b76a32daa8fad","c1c487b5d5080dd3dd600e8e1c0a088c8be0c166","1521d39088b203ddac981d10d214f463449ae95b","0e0a79910ddb8dedc198c56a803ea774af47d3a3","1a42cf0636bf722d3ea8a767977b1c52bdcf42c3","6f3e4824c21e7c337017798e0cdccce8432f7213","2af4a96f88ec630c57a28461751af3659ec98dd4","1c198cee01873748fcca51452bf3b3ce87927e2a","7bf3774e980d836acab5980553c24e40695b7edc","0706356c9ab6014d6b04577d38289ea8328291a5","79c09f6117a0869c720f62d9535cf83a1cd09038","4587d4722317acd4e2a90b12f58ccc9de1ecc6ee","084bd6a652cbc07ffeae4385a3964da24f62a7e0","2f103cf8b2cf7d2e4c877c52bfad2847b6fbfd92"],"id":"3bbca0e874faf786f75ce852647346a201c3209e","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3bbca0e874faf786f75ce852647346a201c3209e","authors":[{"name":"Katchaguy Areekijseree","ids":["8907121"]},{"name":"Ricky Laishram","ids":["3422563"]},{"name":"Sucheta Soundarajan","ids":["2370207"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3201064.3201066"}

Because of inherent data sparsity, it remains a challenging problem for deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new CF model, namely the imputation-boosted denoising autoencoder (IDAE), for top-N recommendation. Specifically, IDAE consists of two steps: imputing positive values and learning with imputed values. First, it infers and imputes positive user feedback from missing values. Then, the correlation between items is learned by using the denoising autoencoder (DAE) with imputed values. Unlike the existing DAE that randomly corrupts the input, the key characteristic of IDAE is that original user values are taken as the input, and imputed values are reflected as the corrupted output. Our experimental results demonstrate that IDAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CF algorithms using autoencoders (by up to 5%) on the MovieLens datasets.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"IDAE: Imputation-boosted Denoising Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering","journalPages":"2143-2146","s2PdfUrl":"","pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133158"],"entities":["Algorithm","Artificial neural network","Autoencoder","Collaborative filtering","Deep learning","Geo-imputation","Missing data","MovieLens","Noise reduction","Randomness","Sparse matrix"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["7c99d40a36506a7e9482267114711ce2a4a8c2c7","5475b630d681f2efdabecd0f814b97c4576cca47","ece016d98b66d21489169cc4c7bbb5973d658e79","7656cddac460af91919558175063938acfdd813b","de2a0b7ec920e94fcbdeb9ae1f6c7e92cd1e7470","ba09fe99a82a723201e67ea33321f3decefd1bb8","d11c75ce793893b3e9d77375a9f8ff6a1b36e3cc","0aa2a4d259433016ebc899c496faea03c024c0bd","e2b7f37cd97a7907b1b8a41138721ed06a0b76cd","6c02053805434162e0fed26e1d5e035eb1071249","5d6a9327a9d686bfe2c1fc6aebd0b853790f82d7","4672f24bf1828452dc367669ab8a29f79834ad58","bf9ca74b5b82e9679383e0d1e9e4ae9b14b68b99","9e91c370a8fae365c731947ad9178fb3788f6593","3cbcd163a1a398d9b22c8b85f993e3c62bbd3701"],"id":"191413cc5cef6f95069db994c1f51b24a2b71f8d","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/191413cc5cef6f95069db994c1f51b24a2b71f8d","authors":[{"name":"Jae-woong Lee","ids":["46663307"]},{"name":"Jongwuk Lee","ids":["1865093"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3132847.3133158"}

It has drawn considerable attention in the Description Logic (DL) community where both the complexity of query answering and practical query answering approaches based on rewriting were investigated in detail. Surprisingly, there is still a gap in what is known about the data complexity of query answering w.r.t. ontologies formulated in the inexpressive DL FL0. While it is known that the data complexity of answering conjunctive queries w.r.t. FL0 ontologies is coNP-complete, the exact complexity of answering instance queries was open until now. In the present paper, we show that answering instance queries w.r.t. FL0 ontologies is in P for data complexity. Together with the known lower bound of P-completeness for a fragment of FL0, this closes the gap mentioned above.","inCitations":[],"pmid":"","title":"The Data Complexity of Answering Instance Queries in FL0","journalPages":"1603-1607","s2PdfUrl":"http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0b02/518eb4b84f80ae748addf10d0bbe6b63d534.pdf","pdfUrls":["https://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/~quantla/QuantLA-Publications/data/papers/2018/BaMaPe-RoD-18.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3191618"],"entities":["Abox","Co-NP","Conjunctive query","Datalog","Description logic","First-order predicate","NP-hardness","Ontology (information science)","P (complexity)","Relational database","Rewriting","SQL","Strong NP-completeness"],"journalVolume":"","outCitations":["300300759be356a3a355b21bcc312d87280d93d2","b110e9bed958c651a648f69918f70212c6d0d146","eb7cfabee095cd9392ba2ff0f4d4ccfad0108427","d4e517728690a77751358bc1bfabc559c297d62d","f5c20eae4e479c75ac38f755e4420be9434af6a5","3b0b7a297867b4d3a5f63884182cca0b61bccff9","afb91701d2d696bd49088d93437e80e8ed047a4b","a2af6b7421b627166e181a7a16cdaf9d094a0d05","2e35e5e016a6b1ec6980093dd7e25cc39afae895","5e0a6dbc10fd6ee6c5815252a1dc62cf0fe3af8d","c55321572b3f757b5e8a11ffd0fc871304aba62d","2aa3668a5b01e1e0986f9352c4bfbd80c078326a","025bd24869ec8c8c66f0a00715785f9320fc1c30","f98b722d2e755dde2e36d6e41de7262f660ef612","82a050ec9257b50cac1bec6871076a8f863c60e5","49a505dd39218024404636f9c3b333b106dcbe16","06fe4af8082f8671a1103a1b6c1d892d9a73cc9d"],"id":"0b02518eb4b84f80ae748addf10d0bbe6b63d534","s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0b02518eb4b84f80ae748addf10d0bbe6b63d534","authors":[{"name":"Franz Baader","ids":["1710233"]},{"name":"Pavlos Marantidis","ids":["7998374"]},{"name":"Maximilian Pensel","ids":["2164749"]}],"doi":"10.1145/3184558.3191618"}
