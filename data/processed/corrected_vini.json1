However, these tasks have never been systemically studied before. For my PhD thesis, I plan to formally define the problem of mining medical domain causality for diagnosis assistance and propose methods to solve this problem.\n 1. Ming these textual causalities can be very useful for discovering new knowledge and making decisions. Many studies have been done for causal extraction from the text [1, 4, 5]. However, all these studies are based on pattern or causal triggers, which greatly limit their power to extract causality and rarely consider the frequency of co-occurrence and contextual semantic features. Besides, none of them take the transitivity rules of causality leading to reject those causalities which can be easily get by simple inference. Therefore, we formally define the task of mining causality via frequency of event co-occurrence, semantic distance between event pairs and transitivity rules of causality, and present a factor graph to combine these three resources for causality mining.\n 2. Treatment effectiveness analysis is usually taken as a subset of causal analysis on observational data. For such real observational data, PSM and RCM are two dominant methods. On one hand, it is usually difficult for PSM to find the matched cases due to the sparsity of symptom. On the other hand, we should check every possible (symptom, treatment) pair by exploiting RCM, leading to make the characteristic of exploding up, especially when we want to check the causal relation between a combination of symptoms and a combination of drugs. Besides, the larger number of symptom or treatment in the combination the less number of patient case retrieved, which lead to the lack of statistical significance. Specifically, patients tend to take tens of herbs as the treatment each time in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Therefore, how to evaluate the effectiveness of herbs separately and jointly is really a big challenge. This is also a very fundamental research topic supporting many downstream applications.\n 3. Both hospitals and on-line forums have accumulated sheer amount of records, such as clinical text data and online diagnosis Q&A pairs. The availability of such data in large volume enables automatic disease prediction. There are some papers on disease prediction with electronic health record (EHR) [2], but the research on disease prediction with raw symptoms is still necessary and challenging. Therefore, we propose a general new idea of using the rich contextual information of diseases and symptoms to bridge the gap of disease candidates and symptoms, and detach it from the specific way of implementing the idea using network embedding.\n 4. Recommendation in medical domain is usually a decision-making issue, which requires the ability of explaining \"why\". The ability of explaining \"why\" are basically from two paths. Consider the recommendation suggest you eat more vegetables. You probably do not believe it if there is nothing attached. But if the recommendation gives the literally reasons why eating more vegetables is good you might like to take this suggestion. Consider another scenario, if the recommendation gives you the data of the contrast which show that people who eat more vegetables are healthier than those eat less, it is certain that you also want to take this recommendation. Based on these two intuitions, we present a recommendation model based on proofs which are either literally reasons or difference from contrast.\n This work was supported by the 973 program (No. 2014CB340503) and the NSFC (No. 61133012 and No. 61472107).", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[686, 704, "Task"], [884, 905, "Task"], [386, 401, "Task"], [406, 423, "Task"], [497, 503, "Task"], [1557, 1573, "Task"], [1751, 1767, "Task"], [2875, 2893, "Material"], [2980, 3008, "Task"], [3035, 3053, "Task"], [3115, 3133, "Task"], [3416, 3433, "Method"], [4141, 4161, "Method"], [597, 621, "Task"], [724, 756, "Task"]]}

{"id": 633, "text": "Sponsored search aims at retrieving the advertisements that in the one hand meet users' intent reflected in their search queries, and in the other hand attract user clicks to generate revenue. Advertisements are typically ranked based on their expected revenue that is computed as the product between their predicted probability of being clicked (i.e., namely clickability) and their advertiser provided bid. The relevance of an advertisement to a user query is implicitly captured by the predicted clickability of the advertisement, assuming that relevant advertisements are more likely to attract user clicks. However, this approach easily biases the ranking toward advertisements having rich click history. This may incorrectly lead to showing irrelevant advertisements whose clickability is not accurately predicted due to lack of click history. Another side effect consists of never giving a chance to new advertisements that may be highly relevant to be printed due to their lack of click history. To address this problem, we explicitly measure the relevance between an advertisement and a query without relying on the advertisement's click history, and present different ways of leveraging this relevance to improve user search experience without reducing search engine revenue. Specifically, we propose a machine learning approach that solely relies on text-based features to measure the relevance between an advertisement and a query. We discuss how the introduced relevance can be used in four important use cases: pre-filtering of irrelevant advertisements, recovering advertisements with little history, improving clickability prediction, and re-ranking of the advertisements on the final search result page.

To support queries across content modalities, the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing.

In this paper, we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically, CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space, and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors, which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time.

Our experiments on real world and synthetic networks high- light the inter-relations between RCCs, expander graphs, and the core-periphery structure of the network. We show empirically and theoretically that RCCs exist, if the core-periphery structure of the network is such that each shell is an expander graph, and their density decreases from inner to outer shells. We further demonstrate that in addition to being an interesting topological feature, the presence of RCCs is useful in several appli- cations.

{"id": 652, "text": "The goal of search result diversification is to select a subset of documents from the candidate set to satisfy as many different subtopics as possible. In general, it is a problem of subset selection and selecting an optimal subset of documents is NP-hard. Existing methods usually formalize the problem as ranking the documents with greedy sequential document selection. At each of the ranking position the document that can provide the largest amount of additional information is selected. It is obvious that the greedy selections inevitably produce suboptimal rankings. In this paper we propose to partially alleviate the problem with a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhanced Markov decision process (MDP), referred to as M$^2$Div. In M$^2$Div, the construction of diverse ranking is formalized as an MDP process where each action corresponds to selecting a document for one ranking position.

The produced raw policy and value are then strengthened with MCTS through exploring the possible rankings at the subsequent positions, achieving a better search policy for decision-making.

Given the variety of approaches, collective agreement on the indicators that signify credible content could allow for greater collaboration and data-sharing across initiatives. In this paper, we present an initial set of indicators for article credibility defined by a diverse coalition of experts. These indicators originate from both within an article’s text as well as from external sources or article metadata. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dataset of 40 articles of varying credibility annotated with our indicators by 6 trained annotators using specialized platforms. We discuss future steps including expanding annotation, broadening the set of indicators, and considering their use by platforms and the public, towards the development of interoperable standards for content credibility.

The fact that the data is freely available raises the question of financing these services, however. As we will discuss in this paper, advertisement and donations cannot easily be applied to this new setting. To create incentives to subsidize data providers, we propose that sponsors should pay the providers to promote sponsored data. In return, sponsored data will be privileged over non-sponsored data. Since it is not possible to enforce a certain ordering on the data the user will receive, we propose to split up the data into different batches and deliver these batches with different delays. In this way, we can privilege sponsored data without withholding any non-sponsored data from the user. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a delayed-answer auction, where sponsors can pay to prioritize their data. We introduce a new model which captures the particular situation when a user access data in the Web of Data.

They also ignore the spatiality of the players. There is a strong relationship among players and their teams, which can be represented as a network consisting of multi-type interrelated objects.

RPLF considers players’ region-wise intra-type and inter-type relationbased features to rank the players. Considering multi-type interrelated objects is based on the intuition that a batsman scoring high against top bowlers of a strong team or a bowler taking wickets against top batsmen of a strong team is considered as a good player.

In addition, existing methods generally rely heavily on some discriminative common user attributes, and thus are hard to be generalized. Motivated by the isomorphism across social networks, in this paper we consider all the users in a social network as a whole and perform UIL from the user space distribution level. The insight is that we convert the unsupervised UIL problem to the learning of a projection function to minimize the distance between the distributions of user identities in two social networks.

However, recommendation for newly launched social media sites is challenging because they often lack user historical data and encounter data sparsity and cold-start problem. Thus, it is important to exploit auxiliary information to help improve recommendation performances on these sites. Existing approaches try to utilize the knowledge transferred from other mature sites, which often require overlapped users or similar items to ensure an effective knowledge transfer. However, these assumptions may not hold in practice because 1) Overlapped user set is often unavailable and costly to identify due to the heterogeneous user profile, content and network data, and 2) Different schemes to show item attributes across sites cause the attribute values inconsistent, incomplete, and noisy. Thus, how to transfer knowledge when no direct bridge is given between two social media sites remains a challenge. In addition, another auxiliary information we can exploit is the mutual benefit between social relationships and rating preferences within the platform. User-user relationships are widely used as side information to improve item recommendation, whereas how to exploit user-item interactions for friend recommendation is rather limited. To tackle these challenges, we propose aCross media jointF riend andI temRe commendation framework (CrossFire ), which can capture both 1) cross-platform knowledge transfer, and 2) within-platform correlations among user-user relations and user-item interactions.

An assumption of transfer learning in collaborative filtering is that the source domain is a full rating matrix, which may not hold in many real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage rating patterns from multiple incomplete source domains to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the transferred learning, we compress the knowledge from the source domain into a cluster-level rating matrix. The rating patterns in the low-level matrix can be transferred to the target domain. Specifically, we design a knowledge extraction method to enrich rating patterns by relaxing the full rating restriction on the source domain.

{"id": 732, "text": "The problem of deciding the overall sentiment of a user review is usually treated as a text classification problem. The simplest machine learning setup for text classification uses a unigram bag-of-words feature representation of documents, and this has been shown to work well for a number of tasks such as spam detection and topic classification. However, the problem of sentiment analysis is more complex and not as easily captured with unigram (single-word) features. Bigram and trigram features capture certain local context and short distance negations—thus outperforming unigram bag-of-words features for sentiment analysis. But higher order n-gram features are often overly specific and sparse, so they increase model complexity and do not generalize well. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of skip-gram features for large scale sentiment analysis. We demonstrate that skip-grams can be used to improve sentiment analysis performance in a model-efficient and scalable manner via regularized logistic regression. The feature sparsity problem associated with higher order n-grams can be alleviated by grouping similar n-grams into a single skip-gram: For example, “waste time” could match the n-gram variants “waste of time”, “waste my time”, “waste more time”, “waste too much time”, “waste a lot of time”, and so on. To promote model-efficiency and prevent overfitting, we demonstrate the utility of logistic regression incorporating both L1 regularization (for feature selection) and L2 regularization (for weight distribution).", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[87, 106, "Task"], [156, 175, "Task"], [308, 322, "Task"], [327, 347, "Task"], [373, 391, "Task"], [612, 630, "Task"], [848, 866, "Task"], [922, 940, "Task"], [1458, 1475, "Method"], [1504, 1521, "Method"], [888, 898, "Method"], [998, 1029, "Method"], [1419, 1438, "Method"], [440, 447, "Method"], [472, 478, "Method"], [483, 490, "Method"], [813, 822, "Method"], [183, 203, "Method"], [578, 598, "Method"], [1157, 1166, "Method"]]}

In this tutorial, we focus on discussing the GAN techniques and the variants on discrete data fitting in various information retrieval scenarios. (i) We introduce the fundamentals of GAN framework and its theoretic properties; (ii) we carefully study the promising solutions to extend GAN onto discrete data generation; (iii) we introduce IRGAN, the fundamental GAN framework of fitting single ID data distribution and the direct application on information retrieval; (iv) we further discuss the task of sequential discrete data generation tasks, e.g., text generation, and the corresponding GAN solutions; (v) we present the most recent work on graph/network data fitting with node embedding techniques by GANs. Meanwhile, we also introduce the relevant open-source platforms such as IRGAN and Texygen to help audience conduct research experiments on GANs in information retrieval.

Through hundreds of functions that provide access to a vast wealth of structured and semi-structured data, the terminal is able to satisfy a wide range of information needs. Users can find what they need by constructing queries, plotting charts, creating alerts, and so on. Until recently, most queries to the terminal were constructed through dedicated GUIs. For instance, if users wanted to screen for technology companies that met certain criteria, they would specify the criteria by filling out a form via a sequence of interactions with GUI elements such as drop-down lists, checkboxes, radio and toggle buttons, etc. To facilitate information retrieval in the terminal, we are equipping it with the ability to understand and answer queries expressed in natural language. Our QA (question answering) systems map structurally complex questions like the above to a logical meaning representation which can then be translated to an executable query language (such as SQL or SPARQL). At that point we can execute the queries against a suitable back end, obtain the results, and present them to the users. Adding a natural-language interface to a data repository introduces usability challenges of its own, chief amongst them being this: How can the user know what the system can and cannot understand and answer (without needing to undergo extensive training)? We can unpack this question into two separate parts: 1) How can we convey the full range of the system's abilities? 2) How can we convey its limitations? We use auto-complete as a tool to help meet both challenges. Specifically, the first question pertains to the general issue of discoverability: We want at least some of the suggested completions to act as vehicles for discovering data and functionality of which users may have not been previously aware. The second question pertains to expectation management. Naturally, no QA system can attain perfect performance; limiting factors include representational shortcomings and various kinds of incompleteness of the underlying data sources, as well as NLP technology limitations.

Multimodal search gives users the means to clearly express what they are looking for.

Multimodal search requires intermodal representations of visual and textual fashion attributes which can be mixed and matched to form the user's desired product, and which have a mechanism to indicate when a visual and textual fashion attribute represent the same concept. With a neural network, we induce a common, multimodal space for visual and textual fashion attributes where their inner product measures their semantic similarity. We build a multimodal retrieval model which operates on the obtained intermodal representations and which ranks images based on their relevance to a multimodal query.

Each node is associated with a number of geolocated actions that users of an online platform took in its vicinity. In these networks, we define a prize-collecting subgraph to be a connected set of nodes, which exhibits high levels of activity, and is compact, i.e., the nodes are close to each other.

We de ne a production and consumption measure for social-media users, which captures the political leaning of the content shared and received by them. By comparing the two, we nd that Twitter users are, to a large degree, exposed to political opinions that agree with their own. We also nd that users who try to bridge the echo chambers, by sharing content with diverse leaning, have to pay a “price of bipartisanship” in terms of their network centrality and content appreciation.

{"id": 796, "text": "Link prediction in dynamic networks is an important task with many real-life applications in different domains, such as social networks, cyber-physical systems, and bioinformatics. There are two key processes in dynamic networks: network structural evolution and network temporal evolution, where the former represents interdependency between entities and their neighbors in the network at each timestamp, while the latter captures the evolving behavior of the entire network from the current timestamp to the next. Structural evolution generally assumes that a node is more likely to co-evolve with its neighbors in the near future. Temporal evolution focuses on the trend of network evolution as a whole, based on the accumulation of historical data. It is thus essential to use characteristics of both structural and temporal evolutions to emulate complex behaviors of dynamic networks. However, very few existing work considered both processes. In addition, real-life networks are often very sparse with limited observed links. A missing link between two nodes does not always imply that the two nodes do not have a relation in reality, especially when they share many common neighbors. Most existing methods only focus on the first-order proximity of networks, which is usually insufficient to capture the relationships among nodes. \n In this work, we propose a novel framework named STEP, to simultaneously integrate both structural and temporal information in link prediction in dynamic networks. STEP first constructs a sequence of higher-order proximity matrices to better capture the implicit relationships among nodes. A regularized optimization problem is then formulated to model those higher-order proximity matrices along with additional structural and temporal constraints. Given the large scale of modern networks, we also develop an efficient block coordinate gradient descent approach to solve the optimization problem efficiently.

To alleviate the sparsity that affects the usefulness of recommendations by BPR for users with few check-ins, various approaches have been proposed in the literature to incorporate additional sources of information such as the social links between users, the textual content of comments, as well as the geographical location of the venues. However, such approaches can only readily leverage one source of additional information for negative sampling. Instead, we propose a novel Personalised Ranking Framework with Multiple sampling Criteria (PRFMC) that leverages both geographical influence and social correlation to enhance the effectiveness of BPR. In particular, we apply a multi-centre Gaussian model and a power-law distribution method, to capture geographical influence and social correlation when sampling negative venues, respectively. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three large-scale datasets from the Yelp, Gowalla and Brightkite LBSNs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of fusing both geographical influence and social correlation in our proposed PRFMC framework and its superiority in comparison to BPR-based and other similar ranking approaches. Indeed, our PRFMC approach attains a 37% improvement in MRR over a recently proposed approach that identifies negative venues only from social links.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[184, 219, "Method"], [1182, 1209, "Method"], [1216, 1245, "Method"], [1605, 1620, "Method"], [1762, 1765, "Metric"], [579, 582, "Method"], [1151, 1154, "Method"], [982, 1052, "Method"], [242, 256, "Task"], [0, 12, "Task"], [1718, 1732, "Method"]]}

Such characteristics favor sequence modeling tasks. However, it still remains a huge challenge to model sequences with DGMs. Unlike real-valued data that can be directly fed into models, sequence data consist of discrete elements and require being transformed into certain representations first. This leads to the following two challenges. First, high-level features are sensitive to small variations of inputs as well as the way of representing data. Second, the models are more likely to lose long-term information during multiple transformations. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Generative Model With Dual Memory to address the two challenges. Furthermore, we provide a method to efficiently perform inference and learning on the model. The proposed model extends basic DGMs with an improved hierarchically organized multi-layer architecture. Besides, our model incorporates memories along dual directions, respectively denoted as broad memory and deep memory. The model is trained end-to-end by optimizing a variational lower bound on data log-likelihood using the improved stochastic variational method. We perform experiments on several tasks with various datasets and obtain excellent results. The results of language modeling show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art results in terms of generative performance.

{"id": 812, "text": "The majority of online display ads are served through real-time bidding (RTB) --- each ad display impression is auctioned off in real-time when it is just being generated from a user visit. To place an ad automatically and optimally, it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition, we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation using neural networks.

Recent studies illustrate that incorporating social trust in Matrix Factorization methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust Metrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their interactions. In this paper, first we present how social relation can be extracted from users’ ratings to items by describing Hellinger distance between users in recommender systems. Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted trust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social relation extraction from three wellknown real-world datasets, which both: trust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit social relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same performance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users. Hence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the state-ofthe-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the extracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the prediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information. The experimental results support the idea of employing implicit trust into matrix factorization whenever explicit trust is not available, can perform much better than the state-of-the-art approaches in user rating prediction. c © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.

Against the backdrop of this research, a basic question has received comparatively little attention: how desirable are cascades on a social media platform from the point of view of users? While versions of this question have been considered from the perspective of the producers of cascades, any answer to this question must also take into account the effect of cascades on their audience — the viewers of the cascade who do not directly participate in generating the content that launched it. In this work, we seek to fill this gap by providing a consumer perspective of information cascades. Users on social and information networks play the dual role of producers and consumers, and our work focuses on how users perceive cascades as consumers. Starting from this perspective, we perform an empirical study of the interaction of Twitter users with retweet cascades. We measure how often users observe retweets in their home timeline, and observe a phenomenon that we term the Impressions Paradox: the share of impressions for cascades of size k decays much more slowly than frequency of cascades of size k. Thus, the audience for cascades can be quite large even for rare large cascades. We also measure audience engagement with retweet cascades in comparison to non-retweeted or organic content. Our results show that cascades often rival or exceed organic content in engagement received per impression. This result is perhaps surprising in that consumers didn’t opt in to see tweets from these authors. Furthermore, although cascading content is widely popular, one would expect it to eventually reach parts of the audience that may not be interested in the content. Motivated by the tension in these empirical findings, we posit a simple theoretical model that focuses on the effect of cascades on the audience (rather than the cascade producers).

Thus, a successful model of bartering requires us to understand not just users' preferences, but also the social dynamics of who trades with whom, and the temporal dynamics of when trades occur.\n We propose new models for bartering-based recommendation, for which we introduce three novel datasets from online bartering platforms. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods (based on matching algorithms) perform poorly on real-world platforms, as they rely on idealized assumptions that are not supported by real bartering data.

We show— theoretically, via simulation, and through experiments on real user data—that de-identified web browsing histories can be linked to social media profiles using only publicly available data. Our approach is based on a simple observation: each person has a distinctive social network, and thus the set of links appearing in one’s feed is unique. Assuming users visit links in their feed with higher probability than a random user, browsing histories contain tell-tale marks of identity. We formalize this intuition by specifying a model of web browsing behavior and then deriving the maximum likelihood estimate of a user’s social profile. We evaluate this strategy on simulated browsing histories, and show that given a history with 30 links originating from Twitter, we can deduce the corresponding Twitter profile more than 50% of the time. To gauge the real-world e↵ectiveness of this approach, we recruited nearly 400 people to donate their web browsing histories, and we were able to correctly identify more than 70% of them. We further show that several online trackers are embedded on su ciently many websites to carry out this attack with high accuracy. Our theoretical contribution applies to any type of transactional data and is robust to noisy observations, generalizing a wide range of previous de-anonymization attacks. Finally, since our attack attempts to find the correct Twitter profile out of over 300 million candidates, it is—to our knowledge—the largestscale demonstrated de-anonymization to date.

However, it is nontrivial to use such information, since some of a person's friends may share similar preferences in certain aspects, but others may be totally irrelevant for recommendations. Thus one challenge is to explore and exploit the extend to which a user trusts his/her friends when utilizing social information to improve recommendations. On the other hand, most existing social recommendation models are non-interactive in that their algorithmic strategies are based on batch learning methodology, which learns to train the model in an offline manner from a collection of training data which are accumulated from users? historical interactions with the recommender systems. In the real world, new users may leave the systems for the reason of being recommended with boring items before enough data is collected for training a good model, which results in an inefficient customer retention. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method for interactive social recommendation, which not only simultaneously explores user preferences and exploits the effectiveness of personalization in an interactive way, but also adaptively learns different weights for different friends.

GMM has direct applications in machine learning as a positive definite kernel and can be efficiently linearized via probabilistic hashing to handle big data. Owing to its discrete nature, the hashed values can also be used to build hash tables for efficient near neighbor search. We prove the theoretical limit of GMM and the consistency result, assuming that the data follow an elliptical distribution, which is a general family of distributions and includes the multivariate normal and t-distribution as special cases. The consistency result holds as long as the data have bounded first moment (an assumption which typically holds for data commonly encountered in practice). Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic normality of GMM. We also prove the limit of cosine under elliptical distributions. In comparison, the consistency of GMM requires much weaker conditions. For example, when data follow a t-distribution with ν degrees of freedom, GMM typically provides a better estimate of similarity than cosine when ν < 8 (ν = 8 means the distribution is very close to normal).

{"id": 841, "text": "As an effective way of learning node representations in networks, network embedding has attracted increasing research interests recently. Most existing approaches use shallow models and only work on static networks by extracting local or global topology information of each node as the algorithm input. It is challenging for such approaches to learn a desirable node representation on incomplete graphs with a large number of missing links or on dynamic graphs with new nodes joining in. It is even challenging for them to deeply fuse other types of data such as node properties into the learning process to help better represent the nodes with insufficient links. In this paper, we for the first time study the problem of network embedding on incomplete networks. We propose a Multi-View Correlation-learning based Deep Network Embedding method named MVC-DNE to incorporate both the network structure and the node properties for more effectively and efficiently perform network embedding on incomplete networks. Specifically, we consider the topology structure of the network and the node properties as two correlated views. The insight is that the learned representation vector of a node should reflect its characteristics in both views. Under a multi-view correlation learning based deep autoencoder framework, the structure view and property view embeddings are integrated and mutually reinforced through both self-view and cross-view learning. As MVC-DNE can learn a representation mapping function, it can directly generate the representation vectors for the new nodes without retraining the model. Thus it is especially more efficient than previous methods.

Such sensor-driven applications are very often characterized by (a) very long TS and (b) very large TS datasets needing classification.

Each behavioral model results in a different metric used to evaluate search performance. In these models and the user behavior assumptions behind them, when a user ends a search session is one of the prime concerns because it is highly related to both benefit and cost estimation. Existing metric design usually adopts some simplified criteria to decide the stopping time point: (1) upper limit for benefit (e.g. RR, AP); (2) upper limit for cost (e.g. Precision@N, DCG@N). However, in many practical search sessions (e.g. exploratory search), the stopping criterion is more complex than the simplified case. Analyzing benefit and cost of actual users' search sessions, we find that the stopping criteria vary with search tasks and are usually combination effects of both benefit and cost factors. Inspired by a popular computer game named Bejeweled, we propose a Bejeweled Player Model (BPM) to simulate users' search interaction processes and evaluate their search performances. In the BPM, a user stops when he/she either has found sufficient useful information or has no more patience to continue. Given this assumption, a new evaluation framework based on upper limits (either fixed or changeable as search proceeds) for both benefit and cost is proposed.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning to rank model on the basis of Markov decision process (MDP), referred to as MDPRank. In the learning phase of MDPRank, the construction of a document ranking is considered as a sequential decision making, each corresponds to an action of selecting a document for the corresponding position. The policy gradient algorithm of REINFORCE is adopted to train the model parameters. The evaluation measures calculated at every ranking positions are utilized as the immediate rewards to the corresponding actions, which guide the learning algorithm to adjust the model parameters so that the measure is optimized. Experimental results on LETOR benchmark datasets showed that MDPRank can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[338, 342, "Metric"], [453, 457, "Metric"], [461, 465, "Metric"], [50, 71, "Task"], [178, 223, "Metric"], [380, 401, "Task"], [919, 948, "Method"], [965, 972, "Method"], [999, 1006, "Method"], [1556, 1563, "Method"], [1519, 1543, "Material"], [29, 45, "Method"], [112, 119, "Task"], [880, 896, "Method"]]}

Three interesting findings indicate users' behavior biases: (1) instead of the traditional \"Golden Triangle'' phenomena in the user examination patterns of general Web search, we observe a middle-position bias, (2) besides the position factor, the content of image results (e.g., visual saliency) affects examination behavior, and (3) some popular behavior assumptions in general Web search (e.g., examination hypothesis) do not hold in image search scenarios.

The first step is often a daunting discovery task that requires searching through an overwhelming number of information sources without introducing bias from the analyst’s current knowledge or limitations of the information sources. A common requirement for many analysis reports is a deep understanding of various kinds of historical and ongoing events that are reported in the media. To enable better analysis based on events, there exist several event databases containing structured representations of events extracted from news articles. Examples include GDELT [4], ICEWS [1], and EventRegistry [3]. These event databases have been successfully used to perform various kinds of analysis tasks, e.g., forecasting societal events [6]. However, there has been little work on the discovery aspect of the analysis, that results in a gap between the information requirements and the available data, and potentially a biased view of the available information. In this presentation, we describe a framework for concept discovery over event databases using semantic technologies. Unlike existing concept discovery solutions that perform discovery over text documents and in isolation from the remaining data analysis tasks [5, 8], our goal is providing a unified solution that allows deep understanding of the same data that will be used to perform other analysis tasks (e.g., hypothesis generation [7] or building models for forecasting [2]). Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system. The system takes in as input a set of event databases and RDF knowledge bases and provides as output a set of APIs that provide a unified retrieval mechanism over input data and knowledge bases, and an interface to a number of concept discovery algorithms. Figures 2 shows different portions of our system’s UI that is built using our concept discovery framework APIs. The analyst can enter a natural language question or a set of concepts, and retrieve collections of relevant concepts identified and ranked using different concept discovery algorithms.

However, in recent times, there is an increasing trend towards false claims in social media, other web-sources, and even in news. Thus, factchecking websites have become increasingly popular to identify such misinformation based on manual analysis. Recent research proposed methods to assess the credibility of claims automatically. However, there are major limitations: most works assume claims to be in a structured form, and a few deal with textual claims but require that sources of evidence or counter-evidence are easily retrieved from the web. None of these works can cope with newly emerging claims, and no prior method can give user-interpretable explanations for its verdict on the claim’s credibility. This paper overcomes these limitations by automatically assessing the credibility of emerging claims, with sparse presence in web-sources, and generating suitable explanations from judiciously selected sources. To this end, we retrieve diverse articles about the claim, and model the mutual interaction between: the stance (i.e., support or refute) of the sources, the language style of the articles, the reliability of the sources, and the claim’s temporal footprint on the web.

Secondly, each user displays multiple personas, each persona has a preference over items which could be dictated by a particular occasion, e.g. dressing for a party would be different from dressing to go to office. Recommendation in this vertical is crucially dependent on discovering styles for each of the multiple personas. There is no literature which addresses this problem.\n We posit a generative model which describes each user by a Simplex Over PERsona, SOPER, where a persona is described as the individuals preferences over prevailing styles modelled as topics over items.

However, the same users can have different bcookies across different browsers and devices. Moreover, bcookies can expire after some period, be cleared by browsers or users. This situation of bcookie discounting typically introduces both performance and delivery problems in online advertising since advertisers are hard to find the most receptive audiences based on the user profile information. In this paper, we try to tackle this problem by using an `assistant identifier' to find the linkage between different bcookies.

We show that social influence accounts for 55% of the observed changes in user behavior, while the remaining 45% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to use the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in the social network lead to significant increases in daily steps.

However, due to errors induced by crowd-based attribute labeling, a naive attribute-based approach becomes extremely inaccurate even with few attributes. To combat these errors, we use error mitigation strategies which allow us to control the accuracy of our results while maintaining significant cost reductions. We develop a probabilistic model which allows us to determine the optimal, lowest-cost combination of error mitigation strategies needed to achieve a minimum desired accuracy. We test our approach with actual crowdworkers on a dataset of celebrity images, and find that our results yield crowd ER strategies which achieve high accuracy yet are significantly lower cost than pairwise-only approaches.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[51, 73, "Task"], [1104, 1112, "Metric"], [1176, 1192, "Material"], [1265, 1273, "Metric"], [1312, 1336, "Method"], [951, 970, "Method"], [698, 722, "Method"]]}
