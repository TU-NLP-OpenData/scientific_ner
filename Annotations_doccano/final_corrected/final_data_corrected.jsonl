For a given set S of n elements, it returns a subset of k«l n representatives maximizing the sum of their pairwise distances, where distance models dissimilarity. An important variant of the primitive prescribes that the desired subset of representatives satisfies an additional orthogonal requirement, which can be specified as a matroid constraint (i.e., a feasible solution must be an independent set of size k). While unconstrained max-sum diversity admits efficient coreset-based strategies, the only known approaches dealing with the additional matroid constraint are inherently sequential and are based on an expensive local search over the entire input set. We devise the first coreset constructions for max-sum diversity under various matroid constraints, together with efficient sequential, MapReduce and Streaming implementations. By running the local-search on the coreset rather than on the entire input, we obtain the first practical solutions for large instances. Technically, our coresets are subsets of S containing a feasible solution which is no more than a factor 1-ε away from the optimal solution, for any fixed ε <1, and, for spaces of bounded doubling dimension, they have a small size independent of n. Extensive experiments show that, with respect to full-blown local search, our coreset-based approach yields solutions of comparable quality, with improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in the running time, also for input sets of unknown dimensionality.", "annotations": [{"label": 96, "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 59, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 75, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 934, "end_offset": 946, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 548, "end_offset": 572, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 878, "end_offset": 887, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 892, "end_offset": 901, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 408, "end_offset": 426, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 703, "end_offset": 715, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 628, "end_offset": 647, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 821, "end_offset": 840, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 17, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 789, "end_offset": 806, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

The needs of a large global corporate lead us to model a frequently asked question (FAQ) to be an equivalence class of actually asked questions, for which there is a common answer (certified as being consistent with the organization's policy). When a new question is posed to our system, it finds the class of question, and responds with the answer for the class. At this point, the system is either correct (gives correct answer); or incorrect (gives wrong answer); or incomplete (says \"I don't know''). We employ a hybrid deep-learning architecture in which a BiLSTM-based classifier is combined with second BiLSTM-based Siamese network in an iterative manner: Questions for which the classifier makes an error during training are used to generate a set of misclassified question-question pairs. These, along with correct pairs, are used to train the Siamese network to drive apart the (hidden) representations of the misclassified pairs. We present experimental results from our deployment showing that our iteratively trained hybrid network: (a) results in better performance than using just a classifier network, or just a Siamese network; (b) performs better than state-of-the art sentence classifiers in the two areas in which it has been deployed, in terms of both accuracy as well as precision-recall tradeoff; and (c) also performs well on a benchmark public dataset. We also observe that using question-question pairs in our hybrid network, results in marginally better performance than using question-to-answer pairs.

Using a Twitter dataset covering 8 events, our empirical results show that the coherence of the topics in our TVB model is improved by the integration of time.

The proposed approach was validated in a real case study, i.e., the analysis of scientific literature on genomics. Specifically, we first analyzed scientific studies on genomics acquired from the OMIM database to discover correlations between authors and genes or genetic disorders.

{"id": 4418, "text": "In the medical context, causal knowledge usually refers to causal relations between diseases and symptoms, living habits and diseases, symptoms which get better and therapy, drugs and side-effects, etc [3]. All these causal relations are usually in medical literature, forum and clinical cases and compose the core part of medical diagnosis. Therefore, mining these causal knowledge to predict disease and recommend therapy is of great value for assisting patients and professionals.\n The task of mining these causal knowledge for diagnosis assistance can be decomposed into four constitutes: (1) mining medical causality from text; (2) medical treatment effectiveness measurement; (3) disease prediction and (4) explicable medical treatment recommendation. However, these tasks have never been systemically studied before. For my PhD thesis, I plan to formally define the problem of mining medical domain causality for diagnosis assistance and propose methods to solve this problem.\n 1. Ming these textual causalities can be very useful for discovering new knowledge and making decisions. Many studies have been done for causal extraction from the text [1, 4, 5]. However, all these studies are based on pattern or causal triggers, which greatly limit their power to extract causality and rarely consider the frequency of co-occurrence and contextual semantic features. Besides, none of them take the transitivity rules of causality leading to reject those causalities which can be easily get by simple inference. Therefore, we formally define the task of mining causality via frequency of event co-occurrence, semantic distance between event pairs and transitivity rules of causality, and present a factor graph to combine these three resources for causality mining.\n 2. Treatment effectiveness analysis is usually taken as a subset of causal analysis on observational data. For such real observational data, PSM and RCM are two dominant methods. On one hand, it is usually difficult for PSM to find the matched cases due to the sparsity of symptom. On the other hand, we should check every possible (symptom, treatment) pair by exploiting RCM, leading to make the characteristic of exploding up, especially when we want to check the causal relation between a combination of symptoms and a combination of drugs. Besides, the larger number of symptom or treatment in the combination the less number of patient case retrieved, which lead to the lack of statistical significance. Specifically, patients tend to take tens of herbs as the treatment each time in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Therefore, how to evaluate the effectiveness of herbs separately and jointly is really a big challenge. This is also a very fundamental research topic supporting many downstream applications.\n 3. Both hospitals and on-line forums have accumulated sheer amount of records, such as clinical text data and online diagnosis Q&A pairs. The availability of such data in large volume enables automatic disease prediction. There are some papers on disease prediction with electronic health record (EHR) [2], but the research on disease prediction with raw symptoms is still necessary and challenging. Therefore, we propose a general new idea of using the rich contextual information of diseases and symptoms to bridge the gap of disease candidates and symptoms, and detach it from the specific way of implementing the idea using network embedding.\n 4. Recommendation in medical domain is usually a decision-making issue, which requires the ability of explaining \"why\". The ability of explaining \"why\" are basically from two paths. Consider the recommendation suggest you eat more vegetables. You probably do not believe it if there is nothing attached. But if the recommendation gives the literally reasons why eating more vegetables is good you might like to take this suggestion. Consider another scenario, if the recommendation gives you the data of the contrast which show that people who eat more vegetables are healthier than those eat less, it is certain that you also want to take this recommendation. Based on these two intuitions, we present a recommendation model based on proofs which are either literally reasons or difference from contrast.\n This work was supported by the 973 program (No. 2014CB340503) and the NSFC (No. 61133012 and No. 61472107).", "annotations": [{"label": 96, "start_offset": 637, "end_offset": 680, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 686, "end_offset": 704, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 713, "end_offset": 756, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 597, "end_offset": 631, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 884, "end_offset": 905, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 353, "end_offset": 359, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 386, "end_offset": 401, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 406, "end_offset": 423, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 497, "end_offset": 503, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 1557, "end_offset": 1573, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 1751, "end_offset": 1767, "user": 2}, {"label": 93, "start_offset": 2875, "end_offset": 2893, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 2980, "end_offset": 3008, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 3035, "end_offset": 3053, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 3115, "end_offset": 3133, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 3416, "end_offset": 3433, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 4141, "end_offset": 4161, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

This may incorrectly lead to showing irrelevant advertisements whose clickability is not accurately predicted due to lack of click history. Another side effect consists of never giving a chance to new advertisements that may be highly relevant to be printed due to their lack of click history. To address this problem, we explicitly measure the relevance between an advertisement and a query without relying on the advertisement's click history, and present different ways of leveraging this relevance to improve user search experience without reducing search engine revenue. Specifically, we propose a machine learning approach that solely relies on text-based features to measure the relevance between an advertisement and a query. We discuss how the introduced relevance can be used in four important use cases: pre-filtering of irrelevant advertisements, recovering advertisements with little history, improving clickability prediction, and re-ranking of the advertisements on the final search result page. Offine experiments using large-scale query logs and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority of the proposed click-oblivious relevance model and the important roles that relevance plays in sponsored search.", "annotations": [{"label": 93, "start_offset": 1758, "end_offset": 1768, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 16, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1834, "end_offset": 1865, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1313, "end_offset": 1329, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Practically this risks providing a poor separation between informative and non-informative terms, thus compromising the discriminative power of the ranking model.

To support queries across content modalities, the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing.

In this paper, we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically, CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space, and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors, which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time.

Our experiments on real world and synthetic networks high- light the inter-relations between RCCs, expander graphs, and the core-periphery structure of the network. We show empirically and theoretically that RCCs exist, if the core-periphery structure of the network is such that each shell is an expander graph, and their density decreases from inner to outer shells. We further demonstrate that in addition to being an interesting topological feature, the presence of RCCs is useful in several appli- cations.

{"id": 4439, "text": "The goal of search result diversification is to select a subset of documents from the candidate set to satisfy as many different subtopics as possible. In general, it is a problem of subset selection and selecting an optimal subset of documents is NP-hard. Existing methods usually formalize the problem as ranking the documents with greedy sequential document selection. At each of the ranking position the document that can provide the largest amount of additional information is selected. It is obvious that the greedy selections inevitably produce suboptimal rankings. In this paper we propose to partially alleviate the problem with a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhanced Markov decision process (MDP), referred to as M$^2$Div. In M$^2$Div, the construction of diverse ranking is formalized as an MDP process where each action corresponds to selecting a document for one ranking position. Given an MDP state which consists of the query, selected documents, and candidates, a recurrent neural network is utilized to produce the policy function for guiding the document selection and the value function for predicting the whole ranking quality. The produced raw policy and value are then strengthened with MCTS through exploring the possible rankings at the subsequent positions, achieving a better search policy for decision-making. Experimental results based on the TREC benchmarks showed that M$^2$Div can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines based on greedy sequential document selection, indicating the effectiveness of the exploratory decision-making mechanism in M$^2$Div.", "annotations": [{"label": 96, "start_offset": 183, "end_offset": 199, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 204, "end_offset": 244, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 334, "end_offset": 370, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 515, "end_offset": 532, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 805, "end_offset": 816, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 983, "end_offset": 1007, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1212, "end_offset": 1216, "user": 2}, {"label": 93, "start_offset": 1374, "end_offset": 1389, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1480, "end_offset": 1516, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 753, "end_offset": 784, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1554, "end_offset": 1591, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 906, "end_offset": 909, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 1305, "end_offset": 1338, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 41, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 76, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 103, "end_offset": 150, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 640, "end_offset": 670, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 680, "end_offset": 709, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 1054, "end_offset": 1085, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 1113, "end_offset": 1149, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Given the variety of approaches, collective agreement on the indicators that signify credible content could allow for greater collaboration and data-sharing across initiatives. In this paper, we present an initial set of indicators for article credibility defined by a diverse coalition of experts. These indicators originate from both within an article’s text as well as from external sources or article metadata. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dataset of 40 articles of varying credibility annotated with our indicators by 6 trained annotators using specialized platforms. We discuss future steps including expanding annotation, broadening the set of indicators, and considering their use by platforms and the public, towards the development of interoperable standards for content credibility.

In order to generate high-quality annotated data with a low time cost for accurate segmentation, in this paper, we propose a novel annotation enrichment strategy, which expands existing coarse annotations of training data to a finer scale. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks have shown that the neural networks trained with the enriched annotations from our framework yield a significant improvement over that trained with the original coarse labels.

{"id": 4446, "text": "The World Wide Web is a massive network of interlinked documents. One of the reasons the World Wide Web is so successful is the fact that most content is available free of any charge. Inspired by the success of the World Wide Web, the Web of Data applies the same strategy of interlinking to data. To this point, most of data in the Web of Data is also free of charge. The fact that the data is freely available raises the question of financing these services, however. As we will discuss in this paper, advertisement and donations cannot easily be applied to this new setting. To create incentives to subsidize data providers, we propose that sponsors should pay the providers to promote sponsored data. In return, sponsored data will be privileged over non-sponsored data. Since it is not possible to enforce a certain ordering on the data the user will receive, we propose to split up the data into different batches and deliver these batches with different delays. In this way, we can privilege sponsored data without withholding any non-sponsored data from the user. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a delayed-answer auction, where sponsors can pay to prioritize their data. We introduce a new model which captures the particular situation when a user access data in the Web of Data. We show how the weighted Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism can be applied to our scenario and we discuss how certain parameters can influence the nature of our auction. With our new concept, we build a first step to a free yet financial sustainable Web of Data.

{"id": 4450, "text": "Players are ranked in various sports to show their importance over other players. Existing methods only consider intra-type links (e.g., player to player and team to team), but ignore inter-type links (e.g., one type of player to another type of player, such as batsman to bowler and player to team) based on cognitive aspects. They also ignore the spatiality of the players. There is a strong relationship among players and their teams, which can be represented as a network consisting of multi-type interrelated objects. In this paper, we propose a players’ ranking method, called Region-wise Players Link Fusion (RPLF) which is applied to the sport of cricket. RPLF considers players’ region-wise intra-type and inter-type relationbased features to rank the players. Considering multi-type interrelated objects is based on the intuition that a batsman scoring high against top bowlers of a strong team or a bowler taking wickets against top batsmen of a strong team is considered as a good player. The experimental results show that RPLF provides promising insights of players’ rankings. RLFP is a generic method and can be applied to different sports for ranking players. A. Daud, A. Hussain, R.

This led to the creation of applications, called information extractors, that extract structured information from unstruc- tured data. The extracted information is stored in a Knowledge Base (KB). KB stores facts about entities like name, type and other attributes. My PhD thesis entitled 'Named Entity Extraction for Knowledgebase Enhancement' deals with information extraction on named entities with the purpose of enhancing a KB. The enhanced KB is in turn used by the information extraction task to refine the extraction process. Thus, KB provides structure and guidance to the extraction task, and gets enhanced by the results of the extraction task. Here we see that the tasks of entity extraction and KB enhancement are mutually dependent and mutually beneficial. Hence in my research I propose methods to enhance both the tasks, in an effort to build a strong and sound named entity extraction system. Named Entity Extraction, also known as Entity Linking (EL) in scientific literature, is the task of determining the identity of entities mentioned in text.

This paper focuses on learning node representations for heterogeneous star networks, which have a center node type linked with multiple attribute node types through different types of edges. In heterogeneous star networks, we observe that the training order of different types of edges affects the learning performance significantly. Therefore we study learning curricula for node representation learning in heterogeneous star networks, i.e., learning an optimal sequence of edges of different types for the node representation learning process. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, with the action as selecting a specific type of edges for learning or terminating the training process, and the state as the sequence of edge types selected so far. The reward is calculated as the performance on external tasks with node representations as features, and the goal is to take a series of actions to maximize the cumulative rewards. We propose an approach based on deep reinforcement learning for this problem. Our approach leverages LSTM models to encode states and further estimate the expected cumulative reward of each state-action pair, which essentially measures the long-term performance of different actions at each state. Experimental results on real-world heterogeneous star networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach over competitive baseline approaches.", "annotations": [{"label": 94, "start_offset": 1115, "end_offset": 1142, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 158, "end_offset": 187, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 712, "end_offset": 735, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1184, "end_offset": 1195, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

However, recommendation for newly launched social media sites is challenging because they often lack user historical data and encounter data sparsity and cold-start problem. Thus, it is important to exploit auxiliary information to help improve recommendation performances on these sites. Existing approaches try to utilize the knowledge transferred from other mature sites, which often require overlapped users or similar items to ensure an effective knowledge transfer. However, these assumptions may not hold in practice because 1) Overlapped user set is often unavailable and costly to identify due to the heterogeneous user profile, content and network data, and 2) Different schemes to show item attributes across sites cause the attribute values inconsistent, incomplete, and noisy. Thus, how to transfer knowledge when no direct bridge is given between two social media sites remains a challenge. In addition, another auxiliary information we can exploit is the mutual benefit between social relationships and rating preferences within the platform. User-user relationships are widely used as side information to improve item recommendation, whereas how to exploit user-item interactions for friend recommendation is rather limited.

However, collaborative filtering usually suffers from limited performance due to the sparsity of user-item interaction.

An assumption of transfer learning in collaborative filtering is that the source domain is a full rating matrix, which may not hold in many real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage rating patterns from multiple incomplete source domains to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the transferred learning, we compress the knowledge from the source domain into a cluster-level rating matrix. The rating patterns in the low-level matrix can be transferred to the target domain. Specifically, we design a knowledge extraction method to enrich rating patterns by relaxing the full rating restriction on the source domain. Finally, we propose a robust multiple-rating-pattern transfer learning model for cross-domain collaborative filtering, which is called MINDTL, to accurately predict missing values in the target domain.

The simplest machine learning setup for text classification uses a unigram bag-of-words feature representation of documents, and this has been shown to work well for a number of tasks such as spam detection and topic classification. However, the problem of sentiment analysis is more complex and not as easily captured with unigram (single-word) features. Bigram and trigram features capture certain local context and short distance negations—thus outperforming unigram bag-of-words features for sentiment analysis. But higher order n-gram features are often overly specific and sparse, so they increase model complexity and do not generalize well. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of skip-gram features for large scale sentiment analysis. We demonstrate that skip-grams can be used to improve sentiment analysis performance in a model-efficient and scalable manner via regularized logistic regression. The feature sparsity problem associated with higher order n-grams can be alleviated by grouping similar n-grams into a single skip-gram: For example, “waste time” could match the n-gram variants “waste of time”, “waste my time”, “waste more time”, “waste too much time”, “waste a lot of time”, and so on.

{"id": 4523, "text": "When a message, such as a piece of news, spreads in social networks, how can we classify it into categories of interests, such as genuine or fake news? Classification of social media content is a fundamental task for social media mining, and most existing methods regard it as a text categorization problem and mainly focus on using content features, such as words and hashtags. However, for many emerging applications like fake news and rumor detection, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features from content. For example, intentional spreaders of fake news may manipulate the content to make it look like real news. To address this problem, this paper concentrates on modeling the propagation of messages in a social network.

{"id": 4532, "text": "Let me begin by saying how honored I am to receive the Gerard Salton Award from SIGIR. I only had the chance to meet Professor Salton once in person, at SIGIR’91 in Chicago, where he invited me as a visiting scholar to Cornell. I could not do that then but had been inspired by his great pioneering work on automatic information retrieval (IR) and the SMART system. He could well have pushed me to a more system-oriented path within IR than the one I actually followed. I’m also humbled by the honour of having been chosen to stand among the previous 11 recipients of this award whose contributions to IR are of greatest value. Honestly, I never believed that I would be giving this talk. As the tradition is, based on several examples by prior Salton Award winners, I’d like to present today a personal reflection on IR. I will begin with some personal history in Information Science and IR and continue by discussing my personal view on the goals and scope of IR. Then I’d like to present some studies seeking to approach those goals and discuss their methodological challenges. I came to the field of IR through Information Science. I started at the University of Tampere aiming at a degree in librarianship. However, I was soon introduced to IR, information behaviour and Information Science through inspiring books by Wilfrid Lancaster, Gerard Salton, and Manfred Kochen. My professor also advised me to study Computer Science, which led me to research on database management systems. Within Information Science, the subfield of user and information needs studies was seen to offer a scientific foundation for the development of libraries. The vast majority of the studies were user studies, or institution-centred studies, focusing on the role of users in the life of libraries.

ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-5657-2/18/07. https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210230 I was exposed to ideas by Gernot Wersig (Informationssoziologie), Nick Belkin (the ASK hypothesis), Brenda Dervin (sense-making theory), and D. C. Engelbart (human augmentation research). These led me to view Information Science as a discipline studying people as actors in their work/life – not as users of some information delivery institutions per se, nor as information seekers per se, but as subjects perceiving their own information environment and interacting with it. At the University of Tampere, we pursued this line of research and contributed to the international debate on the transformation of Information Science from institution focus to person / information practises focus. Alongside Carol C. Kuhlthau’s work on the Information Seeking Process in learning tasks, theoretical reflections led me to think that task complexity affects information seeking. In particular, tasks of different complexity require different types of knowledge to be solved, which may be constructed from information available in different types of sources. Quite self-evident once stated, but not that simple to study. Task complexity as a factor in information interaction got quite popular, however. Others have extended its application in IR and seeking studies, e.g. by proposing taxonomies of work tasks and search tasks. Following the rise of test-collection based IR research, we established our IR Lab and the research group FIRE in the beginning of 1990’s. The IR community focused then on developing ranked retrieval systems that scale up to handling large collections. That research was without doubt very important and successful. Still we thought that a broader user-oriented scope would be beneficial to the field. To advance this, we thought, one needs credibility earned through becoming a full member of the community – through carrying out successful research with similar goals. In addition to making use of the TReC test collections, we decided to build a Finnish language test collection. This had two important benefits: one in the development of NLP methods for IR, and the other in the comeback of graded relevance assessments in IR evaluation. The former led us to quite successful in research into applications of NLP methods in IR across a range of languages; crosslanguage IR using a range of approaches across a range of language pairs; and approximate string matching methods for searching with words not covered by other approaches. The latter inspired the development of evaluation metrics based on graded relevance assessments – the Cumulated Gain metrics family, foremost the nDCG metric. We proposed it as a user-oriented metric because it was based on graded relevance, allowed weighing of relevance levels and discounting the gain incurring from documents found late on the result list.

{"id": 4544, "text": "Determining the similarity between two objects is pertinent to many applications. When the basis for similarity is a set of object-to-object relationships, it is natural to rely on graph-theoretic measures. One seminal technique for measuring the structural-context similarity between a pair of graph vertices is SimRank, whose underlying intuition is that two objects are similar if they are connected by similar objects. However, by design, SimRank as well as its variants capture only a single view or perspective of similarity. Meanwhile, in many real-world scenarios, there emerge multiple perspectives of similarity, i.e., two objects may be similar from one perspective, but dissimilar from another. For instance, human subjects may generate varied, yet valid, clusterings of objects. In this work, we propose a graph-theoretic similarity measure that is natively multiperspective. In our approach, the observed object-to-object relationships due to various perspectives are integrated into a unified graph-based representation, stylised as a hypergraph to retain the distinct perspectives. We then introduce a novel model for learning and reflecting diverse similarity perceptions given the hypergraph, yielding the similarity score between any pair of objects from any perspective. In addition to proposing an algorithm for computing the similarity scores, we also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the algorithm.

For instance, if users wanted to screen for technology companies that met certain criteria, they would specify the criteria by filling out a form via a sequence of interactions with GUI elements such as drop-down lists, checkboxes, radio and toggle buttons, etc. To facilitate information retrieval in the terminal, we are equipping it with the ability to understand and answer queries expressed in natural language. Our QA (question answering) systems map structurally complex questions like the above to a logical meaning representation which can then be translated to an executable query language (such as SQL or SPARQL). At that point we can execute the queries against a suitable back end, obtain the results, and present them to the users. Adding a natural-language interface to a data repository introduces usability challenges of its own, chief amongst them being this: How can the user know what the system can and cannot understand and answer (without needing to undergo extensive training)? We can unpack this question into two separate parts: 1) How can we convey the full range of the system's abilities? 2) How can we convey its limitations?

Each node is associated with a number of geolocated actions that users of an online platform took in its vicinity. In these networks, we define a prize-collecting subgraph to be a connected set of nodes, which exhibits high levels of activity, and is compact, i.e., the nodes are close to each other. The k-PCSubgraphs problem we address in this paper is defined as follows: given an activity network and an integer k , identify k non-overlapping and connected subgraphs of the network such that the nodes of each subgraph are close to each other, and the total number of actions they are associated with is high. Here, we define and study two new variants of the k-PCSubgraphs problem, where the subgraphs of interest are tours and paths. Since both these problems are NP-hard, we provide approximate and heuristic algorithms that run in time nearly-linear to the number of edges.

{"id": 4567, "text": "When a message, such as a piece of news, spreads in social networks, how can we classify it into categories of interests, such as genuine or fake news? Classification of social media content is a fundamental task for social media mining, and most existing methods regard it as a text categorization problem and mainly focus on using content features, such as words and hashtags. However, for many emerging applications like fake news and rumor detection, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features from content. For example, intentional spreaders of fake news may manipulate the content to make it look like real news. To address this problem, this paper concentrates on modeling the propagation of messages in a social network. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, TraceMiner, to (1) infer embeddings of social media users with social network structures; and (2) utilize an LSTM-RNN to represent and classify propagation pathways of a message. Since content information is sparse and noisy on social media, adopting TraceMiner allows to provide a high degree of classification accuracy even in the absence of content information.

A SPARQL micro-service is a lightweight, task-specific SPARQL endpoint that provides access to a small, resource-centric, virtual graph, while dynamically assigning dereferenceable URIs to Web API resources that do not have URIs beforehand. The graph is delineated by the Web API service being wrapped, the arguments passed to this service, and the restricted types of RDF triples that this SPARQLmicro-service is designed to spawn. In this context, we argue that full SPARQL expressiveness can be supported efficiently without jeopardizing servers availability. Eventually, we believe that an ecosystem of SPARQL micro-services could emerge from independent service providers, enabling Linked Data-based applications to glean pieces of data from a wealth of distributed, scalable and reliable services.

{"id": 4569, "text": "Helpdesk is a key component of any large IT organization, where users can log a ticket about any issue they face related to IT infrastructure, administrative services, human resource services, etc. Normally, users have to assign appropriate set of labels to a ticket so that it could be routed to right domain expert who can help resolve the issue. In practice, the number of labels are very large and organized in form of a tree. It is non-trivial to describe the issue completely and attach appropriate labels unless one knows the cause of the problem and the related labels. Sometimes domain experts discuss the issue with the users and change the ticket labels accordingly, without modifying the ticket description. This results in inconsistent and badly labeled data, making it hard for supervised algorithms to learn from. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of creating a conversational helpdesk system, which will ask relevant questions to the user, for identification of the right category and will then raise a ticket on users' behalf. We use attention based seq2seq model to assign the hierarchical categories to tickets. We use a slot filling model to help us decide what questions to ask to the user, if the top-k model predictions are not consistent. We also present a novel approach to generate training data for the slot filling model automatically based on attention in the hierarchical classification model. We demonstrate via a simulated user that the proposed approach can give us a significant gain in accuracy on ticket-data without asking too many questions to users.

This paper studies the phenomenon of political echo chambers on social media. We identify the two components in the phenomenon: the opinion that is shared (“echo”), and the place that allows its exposure (“chamber” — the social network), and examine closely at how these two components interact. We de ne a production and consumption measure for social-media users, which captures the political leaning of the content shared and received by them. By comparing the two, we nd that Twitter users are, to a large degree, exposed to political opinions that agree with their own. We also nd that users who try to bridge the echo chambers, by sharing content with diverse leaning, have to pay a “price of bipartisanship” in terms of their network centrality and content appreciation. In addition, we study the role of “gatekeepers,” users who consume content with diverse leaning but produce partisan content (with a single-sided leaning), in the formation of echo chambers. Finally, we apply these ndings to the task of predicting partisans and gatekeepers from social and content features. While partisan users turn out relatively easy to identify, gatekeepers prove to be more challenging.

{"id": 4583, "text": "Link prediction in dynamic networks is an important task with many real-life applications in different domains, such as social networks, cyber-physical systems, and bioinformatics. There are two key processes in dynamic networks: network structural evolution and network temporal evolution, where the former represents interdependency between entities and their neighbors in the network at each timestamp, while the latter captures the evolving behavior of the entire network from the current timestamp to the next. Structural evolution generally assumes that a node is more likely to co-evolve with its neighbors in the near future. Temporal evolution focuses on the trend of network evolution as a whole, based on the accumulation of historical data. It is thus essential to use characteristics of both structural and temporal evolutions to emulate complex behaviors of dynamic networks. However, very few existing work considered both processes. In addition, real-life networks are often very sparse with limited observed links. A missing link between two nodes does not always imply that the two nodes do not have a relation in reality, especially when they share many common neighbors. Most existing methods only focus on the first-order proximity of networks, which is usually insufficient to capture the relationships among nodes. \n In this work, we propose a novel framework named STEP, to simultaneously integrate both structural and temporal information in link prediction in dynamic networks. STEP first constructs a sequence of higher-order proximity matrices to better capture the implicit relationships among nodes. A regularized optimization problem is then formulated to model those higher-order proximity matrices along with additional structural and temporal constraints. Given the large scale of modern networks, we also develop an efficient block coordinate gradient descent approach to solve the optimization problem efficiently. STEP can be used to solve the link prediction problem in directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted dynamic networks.

However, with today's large variety of users and layouts this is not always the case. In this paper, we consider so-called complex ranking settings where it is not clear what should be displayed, that is, what the relevant items are, and how they should be displayed, that is, where the most relevant items should be placed. These ranking settings are complex as they involve both traditional ranking and inferring the best display order. Existing learning to rank methods cannot handle such complex ranking settings as they assume that the display order is known beforehand. To address this gap we introduce a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning method that is capable of learning complex rankings, both the layout and the best ranking given the layout, from weak reward signals. Our proposed method does so by selecting documents and positions sequentially, hence it ranks both the documents and positions, which is why we call it the Double Rank Model (DRM). Our experiments show that DRM outperforms all existing methods in complex ranking settings, thus it leads to substantial ranking improvements in cases where the display order is not known a priori.", "annotations": [{"label": 96, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 16, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1097, "end_offset": 1120, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 779, "end_offset": 806, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 833, "end_offset": 858, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Bayesian Personalised Ranking (BPR) is a popular pairwise recommendation technique that is used to generate the ranked list of venues of interest to a user, by leveraging the user's implicit feedback such as their check-ins as instances of positive feedback, while randomly sampling other venues as negative instances. To alleviate the sparsity that affects the usefulness of recommendations by BPR for users with few check-ins, various approaches have been proposed in the literature to incorporate additional sources of information such as the social links between users, the textual content of comments, as well as the geographical location of the venues. However, such approaches can only readily leverage one source of additional information for negative sampling. Instead, we propose a novel Personalised Ranking Framework with Multiple sampling Criteria (PRFMC) that leverages both geographical influence and social correlation to enhance the effectiveness of BPR. In particular, we apply a multi-centre Gaussian model and a power-law distribution method, to capture geographical influence and social correlation when sampling negative venues, respectively. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three large-scale datasets from the Yelp, Gowalla and Brightkite LBSNs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of fusing both geographical influence and social correlation in our proposed PRFMC framework and its superiority in comparison to BPR-based and other similar ranking approaches.

Such characteristics favor sequence modeling tasks. However, it still remains a huge challenge to model sequences with DGMs. Unlike real-valued data that can be directly fed into models, sequence data consist of discrete elements and require being transformed into certain representations first. This leads to the following two challenges. First, high-level features are sensitive to small variations of inputs as well as the way of representing data. Second, the models are more likely to lose long-term information during multiple transformations. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Generative Model With Dual Memory to address the two challenges. Furthermore, we provide a method to efficiently perform inference and learning on the model. The proposed model extends basic DGMs with an improved hierarchically organized multi-layer architecture.

{"id": 4599, "text": "The majority of online display ads are served through real-time bidding (RTB) --- each ad display impression is auctioned off in real-time when it is just being generated from a user visit. To place an ad automatically and optimally, it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition, we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation using neural networks.

Recent studies illustrate that incorporating social trust in Matrix Factorization methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust Metrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their interactions. In this paper, first we present how social relation can be extracted from users’ ratings to items by describing Hellinger distance between users in recommender systems. Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted trust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social relation extraction from three wellknown real-world datasets, which both: trust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit social relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same performance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users. Hence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the state-ofthe-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the extracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the prediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information. The experimental results support the idea of employing implicit trust into matrix factorization whenever explicit trust is not available, can perform much better than the state-of-the-art approaches in user rating prediction. c © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.

{"id": 4610, "text": "Cascades on social and information networks have been a tremendously popular subject of study in the past decade, and there is a considerable literature on phenomena such as diffusion mechanisms, virality, cascade prediction, and peer network effects. Against the backdrop of this research, a basic question has received comparatively little attention: how desirable are cascades on a social media platform from the point of view of users? While versions of this question have been considered from the perspective of the producers of cascades, any answer to this question must also take into account the effect of cascades on their audience — the viewers of the cascade who do not directly participate in generating the content that launched it. In this work, we seek to fill this gap by providing a consumer perspective of information cascades. Users on social and information networks play the dual role of producers and consumers, and our work focuses on how users perceive cascades as consumers. Starting from this perspective, we perform an empirical study of the interaction of Twitter users with retweet cascades. We measure how often users observe retweets in their home timeline, and observe a phenomenon that we term the Impressions Paradox: the share of impressions for cascades of size k decays much more slowly than frequency of cascades of size k. Thus, the audience for cascades can be quite large even for rare large cascades. We also measure audience engagement with retweet cascades in comparison to non-retweeted or organic content. Our results show that cascades often rival or exceed organic content in engagement received per impression.

Furthermore, although cascading content is widely popular, one would expect it to eventually reach parts of the audience that may not be interested in the content. Motivated by the tension in these empirical findings, we posit a simple theoretical model that focuses on the effect of cascades on the audience (rather than the cascade producers).

State-of-the-art graph database indexes do not adapt or scale well to dynamic graph database use; they are static, and their ability to prune possible search responses to meet user needs worsens over time as databases change and grow. Users can re-mine indexes to gain some improvement, but it is time consuming. Users must also tune numerous parameters on an ongoing basis to optimize performance and can inadvertently worsen the query response time if they do not choose parameters wisely. Recently, a one-pass algorithm has been developed to enhance the performance of frequent subgraphs based indexes by using the algorithm to update them regularly. However, there are some drawbacks, most notably the need to make updates as the query workload changes.\n In this paper, we propose a new index based on graph-coarsening to speed up subgraph query answering time in dynamic graph databases. Our index is parameter-free, query-independent, scalable,small enough to store in the main memory, and is simpler and less costly to maintain for database updates. Experimental results show that our index outperforms hybrid-indexes (i.e. indexes updated with one-pass) for query answering time in the case of social network databases, and is comparable with these indexes for frequent and infrequent queries on chemical databases. Our index can be updated up to 60 times faster in comparison to one-pass on dynamic graph databases.

In addition, migration behaviors are highly diverse: regardless large or small CPs, they all have dedicated groups of users who like to switch to them for certain types of videos. Regarding reasons of migration, we find CP service quality rarely causes migration, while a few popular videos play a bigger role. Nearly 60% of cross-site migrations are landed to 0.14% top videos.

Thus, a successful model of bartering requires us to understand not just users' preferences, but also the social dynamics of who trades with whom, and the temporal dynamics of when trades occur.\n We propose new models for bartering-based recommendation, for which we introduce three novel datasets from online bartering platforms. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods (based on matching algorithms) perform poorly on real-world platforms, as they rely on idealized assumptions that are not supported by real bartering data. We develop approaches based on Matrix Factorization in order to model the reciprocal interest between users and each other's items. We also find that the social ties between members have a strong influence, as does the time at which they trade, therefore we extend our model to be socially- and temporally-aware.

We show— theoretically, via simulation, and through experiments on real user data—that de-identified web browsing histories can be linked to social media profiles using only publicly available data. Our approach is based on a simple observation: each person has a distinctive social network, and thus the set of links appearing in one’s feed is unique. Assuming users visit links in their feed with higher probability than a random user, browsing histories contain tell-tale marks of identity. We formalize this intuition by specifying a model of web browsing behavior and then deriving the maximum likelihood estimate of a user’s social profile. We evaluate this strategy on simulated browsing histories, and show that given a history with 30 links originating from Twitter, we can deduce the corresponding Twitter profile more than 50% of the time. To gauge the real-world e↵ectiveness of this approach, we recruited nearly 400 people to donate their web browsing histories, and we were able to correctly identify more than 70% of them. We further show that several online trackers are embedded on su ciently many websites to carry out this attack with high accuracy. Our theoretical contribution applies to any type of transactional data and is robust to noisy observations, generalizing a wide range of previous de-anonymization attacks. Finally, since our attack attempts to find the correct Twitter profile out of over 300 million candidates, it is—to our knowledge—the largestscale demonstrated de-anonymization to date.

{"id": 4624, "text": "Social recommendation has been an active research topic over the last decade, based on the assumption that social information from friendship networks is beneficial for improving recommendation accuracy, especially when dealing with cold-start users who lack sufficient past behavior information for accurate recommendation. However, it is nontrivial to use such information, since some of a person's friends may share similar preferences in certain aspects, but others may be totally irrelevant for recommendations. Thus one challenge is to explore and exploit the extend to which a user trusts his/her friends when utilizing social information to improve recommendations. On the other hand, most existing social recommendation models are non-interactive in that their algorithmic strategies are based on batch learning methodology, which learns to train the model in an offline manner from a collection of training data which are accumulated from users? historical interactions with the recommender systems. In the real world, new users may leave the systems for the reason of being recommended with boring items before enough data is collected for training a good model, which results in an inefficient customer retention. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method for interactive social recommendation, which not only simultaneously explores user preferences and exploits the effectiveness of personalization in an interactive way, but also adaptively learns different weights for different friends.

Second, we fix generated topic distribution matrix by a time function to fit interest dynamic transformation. Third, we compute the similarity between the collaboration candidate's feature matrix and the target researcher.

In this study, we develop theoretical results for both the cosine and the GMM (generalized min-max) kernel [26], which is a generalization of the resemblance. GMM has direct applications in machine learning as a positive definite kernel and can be efficiently linearized via probabilistic hashing to handle big data. Owing to its discrete nature, the hashed values can also be used to build hash tables for efficient near neighbor search. We prove the theoretical limit of GMM and the consistency result, assuming that the data follow an elliptical distribution, which is a general family of distributions and includes the multivariate normal and t-distribution as special cases. The consistency result holds as long as the data have bounded first moment (an assumption which typically holds for data commonly encountered in practice). Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic normality of GMM. We also prove the limit of cosine under elliptical distributions. In comparison, the consistency of GMM requires much weaker conditions. For example, when data follow a t-distribution with ν degrees of freedom, GMM typically provides a better estimate of similarity than cosine when ν < 8 (ν = 8 means the distribution is very close to normal).

{"id": 4628, "text": "As an effective way of learning node representations in networks, network embedding has attracted increasing research interests recently. Most existing approaches use shallow models and only work on static networks by extracting local or global topology information of each node as the algorithm input. It is challenging for such approaches to learn a desirable node representation on incomplete graphs with a large number of missing links or on dynamic graphs with new nodes joining in. It is even challenging for them to deeply fuse other types of data such as node properties into the learning process to help better represent the nodes with insufficient links. In this paper, we for the first time study the problem of network embedding on incomplete networks. We propose a Multi-View Correlation-learning based Deep Network Embedding method named MVC-DNE to incorporate both the network structure and the node properties for more effectively and efficiently perform network embedding on incomplete networks. Specifically, we consider the topology structure of the network and the node properties as two correlated views. The insight is that the learned representation vector of a node should reflect its characteristics in both views. Under a multi-view correlation learning based deep autoencoder framework, the structure view and property view embeddings are integrated and mutually reinforced through both self-view and cross-view learning. As MVC-DNE can learn a representation mapping function, it can directly generate the representation vectors for the new nodes without retraining the model. Thus it is especially more efficient than previous methods. Empirically, we evaluate MVC-DNE over three real network datasets on two data mining applications, and the results demonstrate that MVC-DNE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "annotations": [{"label": 96, "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 64, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 83, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1248, "end_offset": 1279, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1286, "end_offset": 1312, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1414, "end_offset": 1447, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1452, "end_offset": 1459, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1690, "end_offset": 1697, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1797, "end_offset": 1804, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 723, "end_offset": 763, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 778, "end_offset": 859, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

In this work, we separate out the influence of these noncontent factors in several ways. First, we focus on ranking pairs of submissions posted to the same community in quick succession, e.g., within 30 seconds; this framing encourages models to focus on time-agnostic and community-specific content features. Within that setting, we determine the relative performance of author vs. content features.

Each behavioral model results in a different metric used to evaluate search performance. In these models and the user behavior assumptions behind them, when a user ends a search session is one of the prime concerns because it is highly related to both benefit and cost estimation. Existing metric design usually adopts some simplified criteria to decide the stopping time point: (1) upper limit for benefit (e.g. RR, AP); (2) upper limit for cost (e.g. Precision@N, DCG@N). However, in many practical search sessions (e.g. exploratory search), the stopping criterion is more complex than the simplified case. Analyzing benefit and cost of actual users' search sessions, we find that the stopping criteria vary with search tasks and are usually combination effects of both benefit and cost factors. Inspired by a popular computer game named Bejeweled, we propose a Bejeweled Player Model (BPM) to simulate users' search interaction processes and evaluate their search performances. In the BPM, a user stops when he/she either has found sufficient useful information or has no more patience to continue. Given this assumption, a new evaluation framework based on upper limits (either fixed or changeable as search proceeds) for both benefit and cost is proposed. We show how to derive a new metric from the framework and demonstrate that it can be adopted to revise traditional metrics like Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG), Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR) and Average Precision (AP).

Thus, it is interesting to ask if we can devise an algorithm that has the ability of leveraging the measures calculated at all of the ranking postilions, for learning a better ranking model. In this paper, we propose a novel learning to rank model on the basis of Markov decision process (MDP), referred to as MDPRank. In the learning phase of MDPRank, the construction of a document ranking is considered as a sequential decision making, each corresponds to an action of selecting a document for the corresponding position. The policy gradient algorithm of REINFORCE is adopted to train the model parameters. The evaluation measures calculated at every ranking positions are utilized as the immediate rewards to the corresponding actions, which guide the learning algorithm to adjust the model parameters so that the measure is optimized. Experimental results on LETOR benchmark datasets showed that MDPRank can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.", "annotations": [{"label": 95, "start_offset": 338, "end_offset": 342, "user": 2}, {"label": 95, "start_offset": 453, "end_offset": 457, "user": 2}, {"label": 95, "start_offset": 461, "end_offset": 465, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 71, "user": 2}, {"label": 95, "start_offset": 178, "end_offset": 223, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 380, "end_offset": 401, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 880, "end_offset": 902, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 919, "end_offset": 948, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 965, "end_offset": 972, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 999, "end_offset": 1006, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1556, "end_offset": 1563, "user": 2}, {"label": 93, "start_offset": 1519, "end_offset": 1543, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 45, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 112, "end_offset": 119, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoDOA to automatically detect the opioid addicts from Twitter, which can potentially assist in sharpening our understanding toward the behavioral process of opioid abuse and addiction. In AutoDOA, to model the users and posted tweets as well as their rich relationships, a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) is first constructed. Then meta-path based approach is used to formulate similarity measures over users and different similarities are aggregated using Laplacian scores. Based on HIN and the combined meta-path, to reduce the cost of acquiring labeled examples for supervised learning, a transductive classification model is built for automatic opioid addict detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply transductive classification in HIN into drug-addiction domain.

The first step is often a daunting discovery task that requires searching through an overwhelming number of information sources without introducing bias from the analyst’s current knowledge or limitations of the information sources. A common requirement for many analysis reports is a deep understanding of various kinds of historical and ongoing events that are reported in the media. To enable better analysis based on events, there exist several event databases containing structured representations of events extracted from news articles. Examples include GDELT [4], ICEWS [1], and EventRegistry [3]. These event databases have been successfully used to perform various kinds of analysis tasks, e.g., forecasting societal events [6]. However, there has been little work on the discovery aspect of the analysis, that results in a gap between the information requirements and the available data, and potentially a biased view of the available information. In this presentation, we describe a framework for concept discovery over event databases using semantic technologies. Unlike existing concept discovery solutions that perform discovery over text documents and in isolation from the remaining data analysis tasks [5, 8], our goal is providing a unified solution that allows deep understanding of the same data that will be used to perform other analysis tasks (e.g., hypothesis generation [7] or building models for forecasting [2]). Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system. The system takes in as input a set of event databases and RDF knowledge bases and provides as output a set of APIs that provide a unified retrieval mechanism over input data and knowledge bases, and an interface to a number of concept discovery algorithms. Figures 2 shows different portions of our system’s UI that is built using our concept discovery framework APIs.

Secondly, each user displays multiple personas, each persona has a preference over items which could be dictated by a particular occasion, e.g. dressing for a party would be different from dressing to go to office. Recommendation in this vertical is crucially dependent on discovering styles for each of the multiple personas.

However, the same users can have different bcookies across different browsers and devices. Moreover, bcookies can expire after some period, be cleared by browsers or users. This situation of bcookie discounting typically introduces both performance and delivery problems in online advertising since advertisers are hard to find the most receptive audiences based on the user profile information.

However, there are major limitations: most works assume claims to be in a structured form, and a few deal with textual claims but require that sources of evidence or counter-evidence are easily retrieved from the web. None of these works can cope with newly emerging claims, and no prior method can give user-interpretable explanations for its verdict on the claim’s credibility. This paper overcomes these limitations by automatically assessing the credibility of emerging claims, with sparse presence in web-sources, and generating suitable explanations from judiciously selected sources. To this end, we retrieve diverse articles about the claim, and model the mutual interaction between: the stance (i.e., support or refute) of the sources, the language style of the articles, the reliability of the sources, and the claim’s temporal footprint on the web.

Following the methodology of previous studies, we constructed personalized product search benchmarks with Amazon product data. Experiments show that our hierarchical embedding model significantly outperforms existing product search baselines on multiple benchmark datasets.", "annotations": [{"label": 96, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 14, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 122, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 307, "end_offset": 321, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 732, "end_offset": 746, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 776, "end_offset": 804, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 808, "end_offset": 851, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 1046, "end_offset": 1060, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1070, "end_offset": 1098, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1218, "end_offset": 1237, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 1441, "end_offset": 1455, "user": 2}, {"label": 93, "start_offset": 1472, "end_offset": 1491, "user": 2}, {"label": 94, "start_offset": 1519, "end_offset": 1548, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 1583, "end_offset": 1597, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

However, despite the widespread adoption of these features, there is little understanding of the consequences that social networking has on user retention, engagement, and online as well as offline behavior.\n Here, we study how social networks influence user behavior in a physical activity tracking application. We analyze 791 million online and offline actions of 6 million users over the course of 5 years, and show that social networking leads to a significant increase in users' online as well as offline activities. Specifically, we establish a causal effect of how social networks influence user behavior. We show that the creation of new social connections increases user online in-application activity by 30%, user retention by 17%, and user offline real-world physical activity by 7% (about 400 steps per day). By exploiting a natural experiment we distinguish the effect of social influence of new social connections from the simultaneous increase in user's motivation to use the app and take more steps. We show that social influence accounts for 55% of the observed changes in user behavior, while the remaining 45% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to use the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in the social network lead to significant increases in daily steps. These effects diminish with each additional edge and vary based on edge attributes and user demographics. Finally, we utilize these insights to develop a model that accurately predicts which users will be most influenced by the creation of new social network connections.", "annotations": [{"label": 96, "start_offset": 259, "end_offset": 389, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 751, "end_offset": 794, "user": 2}, {"label": 96, "start_offset": 401, "end_offset": 450, "user": 2}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Moreover, time series observed for one patient at any point in time may be too short and insufficient to learn a high-quality patient-specific model just from the patient's own data. To address these problems we propose, develop and experiment with a new adaptive forecasting framework for building multivariate clinical time series models for a patient and for supporting patient-specific predictions. The framework relies on the adaptive model switching approach that at any point in time selects the most promising time series model out of the pool of many possible models, and consequently, combines advantages of the population, patient-specific and short-term individualized predictive models.

However, the benefits of the other two stakeholders - the advertiser and the user - have been rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational framework that selects a banner ad based on the optimized trade-offs among all stakeholders. The first stage is still auction based and the second stage re-ranks ads by considering the benefits of all stakeholders. Our metric variables are: the publisher's revenue, the advertiser's utility, the ad memorability, the ad click-through rate (CTR), the contextual relevance, and the visual saliency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that optimizes trade-offs among all stakeholders in RTB by incorporating multimedia metrics. An algorithm is also proposed to determine the optimal weights of the metric variables. We use both ad auction datasets and multimedia datasets to validate the proposed framework.

There is therefore a need for unbiased systems able to identify and provide access to varied viewpoints. To address this task, we propose in this paper a novel unsupervised topic model, the Social Network Viewpoint Discovery Model (SNVDM). Given a specific issue (e.g., U.S. policy) as well as the text and social interactions from the users discussing this issue on a social networking site, SNVDM jointly identifies the issue's topics, the users' viewpoints, and the discourse pertaining to the different topics and viewpoints. In order to overcome the potential sparsity of the social network (i.e., some users interact with only a few other users), we propose an extension to SNVDM based on the Generalized Pólya Urn sampling scheme (SNVDM-GPU) to leverage \"acquaintances of acquaintances\" relationships. We benchmark the different proposed models against three baselines, namely TAM, SN-LDA, and VODUM, on a viewpoint clustering task using two real-world datasets.

Besides the existence of topic-specific words and word order, word correlations and the way words organized into sentence are crucial to intention detection tasks. In this paper, we present a neural network based jointly modeling approach to model and capture user intentions in medical related text queries.

Variable-length text queries are first inherently taken care of by a fixed-size pairwise feature correlation matrix. Moreover, convolution and pooling operations are applied on feature correlations to fully exploit latent semantic structure within the query.

The relationship between intent and context is highly dynamic and exhibits chaotic sequential correlation. The context itself is often sparse and heterogeneous. The dynamics and co-movement among contextual signals are also elusive and complicated. Traditional recommendation models cannot directly apply to proactive experiences because they fail to tackle the above challenges.
